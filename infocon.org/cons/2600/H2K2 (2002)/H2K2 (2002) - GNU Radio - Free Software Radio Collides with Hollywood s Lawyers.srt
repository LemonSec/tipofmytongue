1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,880
world

2
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:28,140
well

3
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,410
you guys do research here

4
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,970
all he'll return it is just a minute

5
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,970
so he can come on closer to 10 me
baliles

6
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:26,990
it

7
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,649
lives ira nice songs against us

8
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:37,530
I just my recording

9
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,530
those its sorry

10
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,790
it was cool

11
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:55,790
I'm you

12
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,810
cable TV it started now I the polyline
from here because it's gonna be joining

13
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,320
us here

14
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,619
intimidates planning easier to blossom

15
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:10,258
get started look pretty solid new radio
is about casey the streaming audio

16
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:10,860
months

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,920
this is like radio like the
old-fashioned way to get away with you

18
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,549
at this point he let her do it someone
him

19
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,930
it please the radio frequency spectrum I

20
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,250
where this came from but I think it's
been interesting listings here

21
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,890
protester who this is

22
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,060
about the last eight years working on
secure told

23
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,160
as he said that exercise I get a lot of
work with

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,609
cell phones and looking at what all
those their lot on abilities in the cell

25
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,209
phone number

26
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,280
the you get identified just by being a
specification think

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,349
my but there's nothing like being
demonstrate

28
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:51,090
so where there is a her motivational I
really dislike to be able to get the

29
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,720
bitstream

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,569
of the air on London's long protocols
but it turns out the

31
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:59,599
test expenses or

32
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,358
gave you a person that happen yes and so
I had this injury to a hottie

33
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,440
the tree you they were discovered was
that

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,840
there really were too many says tools
available

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,280
for experimenting with all these new
digital modulations

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,380
so I wouldn't say okay we out here
there's

37
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,420
was God others tools there's some

38
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,530
actually quite expensive really also
passengers and people go home and

39
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,139
specifically for Sterling was awfully

40
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,900
was and

41
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,440
but but what it does is one of them is a
harder reserve in the realm of

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,910
reach reason maybe a ten fifteen
thousand dollars anything but

43
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,930
it took another hundred thousand dollars
with the software

44
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,670
but the whole actually his liar signal
processing cell

45
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,120
just got the FPGA DSP polls great stuff

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,660
only he says I stools me like five
people says

47
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:59,660
tools to the only thing for against I
gave it up variation on the starting

48
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,799
the folks at copy-protection technology
working that's the Motion Picture

49
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,010
Association of America

50
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,440
this was but most people who can come
yeah

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,079
just like are big this year 00 a shit
you know what we're saying that we've

52
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,250
got the best way to do it right now that
we're clear there's a future

53
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,860
yes it would have a shit flexibility and
you know personally I know invested in

54
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,010
preserving their

55
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,539
business and I think it's great that we
literally doing but

56
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,200
it's not let we start to get in trouble
will talk about this more

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,870
little later when they start pushing for
like regulatory

58
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,440
enforcement doing business so the
children Richard A

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,300
she's internet yes something cast
captain Mike other this

60
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,740
up know of that is I just found your mic

61
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,740
to get here

62
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,550
speak into the mic

63
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,230
right easy process yvonne has protection

64
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,380
%uh discussion and so

65
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,740
I a lot of things that are going on in
my group I'm going to affect the new

66
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,260
media

67
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,460
open source okay

68
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,469
I'm so the topic I think it's in in the

69
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,300
in the program as I think about you know
free software

70
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,410
South Korea's client along with it
bringing get at it

71
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,410
pretty much at the end but everyone to
cover through technical

72
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,530
motivation for this what this is really
about probably preaching to the choir

73
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,820
little this that here's days ago

74
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,020
entrar software defined radio general
here

75
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,590
lot which is about positive with
anything else free software this is def

76
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,620
probably pretty little liar who knows
maybe there's something here

77
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,280
signed ways is what is it in radio
specifically what we're trying to do in

78
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
the grand scheme

79
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,380
and holes of the radios hear that hope
for peace and

80
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,340
who specifically working load ATSC is
advanced television

81
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,250
stand India see it was all TV ATSC is a
digital TV

82
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,920
supports potentially high definition TV

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,180
its Standards Committee okay to get

84
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,270
PST have a look at a standstill worst
stand

85
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,620
see feel

86
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,260
anywhere you'd like really has got the
secret decoder ring for them

87
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,289
have to test vectors anything like this
from blues dancing

88
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,070
I but its digital TV which is currently
actually

89
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,469
in a bowl and being broadcasting many
other major

90
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,850
metropolitan areas in the US today
there's

91
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,849
somehow definition I

92
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,998
mostly there's nothing particularly
exciting might have some prime-time

93
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,419
shows

94
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,679
HD you have a digital TV receiver

95
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:05,659
Kara I to where the technology
leadership

96
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:11,279
years three-fourths is is okay then talk
a little bit about politics and then I

97
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,808
want

98
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:15,339
we will cut over I really do take a look
at some other good will do

99
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:19,509
priligy kinases get a certain point is
OK

100
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,770
part about this is awfully was it I
would read that I was able to bring the

101
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,029
actual hard

102
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:33,029
talk a little about running and but it
said desktop dual processor ass lines

103
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,959
barbarism I'm

104
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,439
suffering in general is about really
we're trying to turn all this

105
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,360
thought the used to be a hardware
problem this offer and

106
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,599
the I think it is just trying to get
this offer as close to the end today

107
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,169
feasible and what's feasible you know
there is a genuine

108
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,779
this amazing stuff happened regard to

109
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:00,430
the fact that lottery process of getting
really really fast

110
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,449
mean we we are one of the few people I
know that has

111
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,769
real application that can just consumers

112
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:10,189
in dairy processors perspective that was
so american

113
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,719
you months ago there it there was

114
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,909
really like the people they have don't
think ur

115
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,199
architects Intel and also the same time
the are text

116
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,659
ideas as all of the off-the-record
conference in

117
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:28,569
you know that he's the guy Burton the
30-day 200 givers processes like today

118
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,839
and they're like really really like what
you're doing

119
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,338
did you know you give us a reason to
exist so

120
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,509
have more about urs saw defines the way
for

121
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:42,000
you I'm ham radio operators anybody

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,899
okay if you think about regular

123
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,500
things that we think overalls radios is
traditionally day

124
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,420
either tradition is all on systems I had
my FM radio

125
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,829
a.m. you or I look at early pages

126
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:01,410
hello was pretty much a lot so it really
looking really modems with wheels

127
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,579
units and

128
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,470
bob has cable modems it was all up
because of a long hard

129
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,089
he said hard the specific job but we're
trying to do is getting his situation

130
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,810
really everything is defined as of: this
includes is it a means to

131
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,110
this is am i doing you know PSK
modulation

132
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,810
whole the whole thing trying to get the
hint of and

133
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,970
will talk to the press in exile law and
again with anything that is so the

134
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,890
analog signal processing DSP

135
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,269
this is the standard reasons for doing
the Huskies the harvest reproducible

136
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:38,600
there's nothing to tweak there's no we
build a long hard look at this whole

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,300
problem

138
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,880
dollars in all this there certain
filters for example if you want to hide

139
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,430
anything last ones is just really can't
do it

140
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,260
her Justin good slightly different and
if you do it

141
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,689
is India's p the math is like for
adjustment is multiplied polls closed in

142
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,050
simpson's

143
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,140
such as other sins and out with that you
can implement

144
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,670
using digital signal processing
techniques and just will can't do

145
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,130
within okay while

146
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,110
yyyy release of migrating you know

147
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,829
in Canada questionable however that he's
only doing whatcha gonna get

148
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,060
this is flexible this is where we're
headed the Holy Grail

149
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,200
studies radios that reconfigure just

150
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,510
do the right thing so if you could think
about the future is an ideal you've got

151
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,089
a

152
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,000
PDA unsigned PDA cellphone

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,110
it's your TV receivers are receiver it

154
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,250
it's a device that converts looks away
it says a look and see him

155
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,279
this coffee house and I see who looks
like 1811 be

156
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,740
my mouth wide open and free let's go
okay I can activity outside

157
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,160
moon okay here you know there's a
request in for Internet connectivity

158
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,069
well see a guy

159
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,370
GPRS you know someone looking to get
pushed back so that

160
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,839
ideas ultimately get a situation we have
ardor

161
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,990
get one lot harder module and depending
on the soft words

162
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,570
running mate instead the overhaul
completely different entrances

163
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,420
yeah rather

164
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,800
but is really is going to happen wasn't
even know something about 17 rs2

165
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,110
is actually also some really interesting
stuff happening manned

166
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,000
microelectromechanical systems want to
like this please IC design techniques

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,500
that the building with Canada gadgets it
turns out there's an illegal

168
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,980
Rs that do with that they actually get
with his problems about well I've got

169
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,970
the wrong in 10

170
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,829
okay Missy close to being in forty about
how do I get this

171
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:38,290
they've actually curva much talent

172
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,640
and against its it's not too far off

173
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,490
this multiple personality saying they
can turn into the

174
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,130
turned into my favorites is II carriages
and cell phones with great features

175
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,939
everyday

176
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,420
however I was driving across the country
happily Kansas

177
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,779
let me tell you there are 12 York for
one board other

178
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,920
I seventy with no it's a

179
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,610
well G you know if this thing could you
see

180
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,350
you may or will see them but also 100

181
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,160
fall that answer anything is really is
really have it will have to

182
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,860
we will have to my sister able to on the
fly weakens

183
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,579
the first on the contract with the awful
big deal I

184
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,640
like hundreds please you know this idea
that enough time in cancer

185
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,079
paved so

186
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,199
yeah with social media there's also some
stuff that you really

187
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,260
K do with with traditional analog design

188
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,740
know the clintons bipartisan I'll talk
about what we've got working with

189
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,470
Izturis

190
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,410
able one RF front-end actually receive
or transmit multiple channels at the

191
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:44,819
same

192
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,949
went to the demos that the two gether

193
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:50,949
to the game was a some software that

194
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:54,329
this it turns into the regular broadcast
FM

195
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:58,399
specter and in and leave work early
modulate

196
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,360
to FM stations at the same time it has
held

197
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,459
K semi happily take five thousand
dollars in the heart you do what you can

198
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:08,640
do with king fahd

199
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,370
its cool everything is actually are
section is turned to

200
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,890
tune into one big Chuck about 8 makers
business spectrum

201
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,250
and we can pull out pretty much as many
radio stations from there

202
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,760
at the same time that missing to if
you're if you happen to have been a

203
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,550
surveillance minded person this leads
for example

204
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,750
you could watch hypothetically speaking
all

205
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,890
paging channels possible trust channels
all at the same time in certain

206
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,360
occasions

207
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,559
without missing it was thinking was the
page in jails is your call setup

208
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,199
plus you can watch all the traffic all
the same ones are

209
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,470
I yeah he was we get better

210
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,670
better specialization is about well I
could build these radios at Whistler

211
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,290
I mean today really designed looking his

212
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,870
regulatory regime under with the SEC is

213
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,070
lots of people lots of plans to do about
that

214
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,160
he talked doing hendrix if you look at
the

215
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,560
open spectrum stuff that's on me me a
three-day

216
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,590
on some really great stuff about yes

217
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,190
my SEC's really that the wrong model

218
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,220
the spectrum auctions the ways you could
use Google radios that

219
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,940
for example were designed around the
idea that I customer

220
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,240
radio its gonna know that is operating
interfere in

221
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,300
here this lhasa quote interference

222
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,520
and it's over for the idea is that a
building

223
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,870
really dumb Missy it says listen can be
a way of talking

224
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,490
at the los Martires expense from things
like this with all the time uses a

225
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:50,490
is my last night for for months as well
as would be more like the design your

226
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,030
radios for Jan margin

227
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,970
and you know what the most clever radio
we is a whole different way to approach

228
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,420
it that gets rid this question about do
I need some

229
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,420
entity this its selling off pieces in
the spectrum license even more

230
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,460
whatever intently as well as it does not
mean that much opportunity

231
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,340
innovation I'm personally not ham radio
operator

232
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,580
like here

233
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,800
trade threat to the man you know I
should probably struggle on hold

234
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,640
test I keep looking you know they're not
exactly in the

235
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,270
these are people who are doing they're
they're doing

236
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,340
FSK a missus yyyy

237
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,470
legal nenu cognitively

238
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,970
there's a 10 this is Canada really have
a leading edge the military guys

239
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:44,570
really his im and the idea is that you
cannot do look at the spectrum

240
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,440
and see what's not being used right now
and you take it manager to get some way

241
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,840
to talk about people

242
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,750
hot networking to sell haha questions
we've seen come up with a fisheye

243
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,030
routing also had a 10

244
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,430
run but if you have the tiara there's
also what can be changed on the fly was

245
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,520
a havens like nothing happening over
here

246
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,040
I i talked to a gentleman 2010 in New
York City's Health says he thought the

247
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,630
its ok I respect the laws are here
pretty much my ass turned

248
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,000
intelligent and they said that young
people with cell phones couldn't get

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,660
through

250
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,870
but if you look if you look at spectrum
analyzer we're there was

251
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,050
action spectrum there's like this little
pieces just

252
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,510
Jan and there's a big spaces is nothing
on

253
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,540
this is a situation with things like
talking radios it look at a look and see

254
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,530
what I can do and what can I do

255
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,290
KK Angeles y the audience lol

256
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,310
yeah well

257
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,950
way

258
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,070
okay how come over but he's not doing
this you know this is a great well

259
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,920
today's the solution is actually
considerably higher power and AV

260
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,210
he said so for example the reason you
know our cell phones we really like

261
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,220
personally think

262
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,440
active of the church more than once a
day and I can talk for you know pretty

263
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,760
much as long as i won

264
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,930
it still works now if I happen to be
bernie

265
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,589
15 Watson that's a different story but

266
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,810
what's going to happen and say we need
more bits required

267
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,429
is not you know atop buildings and
dedicated her

268
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,890
israel's loonies and

269
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,110
but there's more minutes to do it on the
agenda because our

270
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:28,990
any cost okay this is currently hot on
the CSTR step

271
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,800
military you would love a good stuff
that we all I was in the midst of a

272
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,540
thought that was a pretty good idea

273
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,720
they're drivin situation

274
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,650
his talk about legacy the tears folks
they got all these different branches

275
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,490
and military different divisions within

276
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,690
different countries differ trying to
enter our everyday they have a

277
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,980
situational have a

278
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,370
really a giant rack radiance and they
want to hear

279
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,620
in this the desert storm stuff was
always does it start it turned out that

280
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,310
all other traffic that could have been
inflicted

281
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,659
there was only like something like five
or six percent was actually pretty is an

282
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,950
improperly problem

283
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,640
so you got all these problems again
stacking radio got some poor guy on the

284
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,740
field they really want him to be a
little one radio can talk to all the

285
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,000
people who owns the doctor

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,330
so if they could build really in this
again was they

287
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,230
they did you know it's been about five
years ago it similarly protections of

288
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,890
the radio

289
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,990
I think they did the right thing isn't
it got a parking ticket by judy is peace

290
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,560
in them

291
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,389
and the baby were your ideal

292
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,900
at that point it's really the same
argument that we're making

293
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,140
is Windows Phone faster and cheaper me

294
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,770
so let's get the math homework else get
the basic infrastructure working with my

295
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,510
the free ride yea and

296
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,510
potency over take force yeah it was
really gonna see

297
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,020
my prediction and really see it first
the cellular base stations

298
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,860
to get this thing with him in Europe
they have pretty much the same just

299
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,460
everybody uses GSM

300
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,040
and GPS for the baseball game your
compatible

301
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,830
reasonable upgrade in the US with that
that legacy

302
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,939
and stuff Alonso

303
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,440
get there the USTA icelanders got the

304
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,269
seeing which is i his name Plus Inc SNGs
and stuff plus a vegetable GPRS

305
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:27,649
yes unfortunately we have 3 G's with you
guys get like a

306
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,699
not really ATT wireless which currently
my new

307
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:34,149
California is a is a nice 136 provide

308
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:37,659
Noel ATT's not stand

309
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:42,339
they understand that GSM and GPRS is a
lot better path for the future

310
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:46,609
including if they ever do go 3G is a
much better have the word

311
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:50,499
the impact across here it today with it
takes is a really have to go

312
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:55,019
get the fourth trawler put up with me
but the others problem there's a lot

313
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,029
going to transition

314
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:00,169
their entire customer base Monday no

315
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:03,779
really for for those customers by phones
on their own lives and

316
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:08,279
features I sort of the review will allow
them to do is if you think about it

317
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,249
attorneys are all those operating the
devil may have made it was busy Rs to

318
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:16,199
so the IRS do it all again it's really
wants is a difference

319
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:20,879
protocols to modulations here so the
software

320
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:24,239
base station the possible on the fly

321
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:27,759
to dynamically alter the allocation
process

322
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,779
so depending on how many I S 136 users I
got

323
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:35,899
at this instant versus how many GSN news
I've got

324
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:40,559
this instant I get done anything
partitions this of course

325
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,759
that's tradition husband are the problem
today without him I

326
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,069
cell phone systems into the lot behind
it was awesome happened with GPRS here

327
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:53,889
in New York City's Cal in this problem
about

328
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:58,009
it's hard to go along with it it is base
station potential is really

329
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,919
more open his software pieces you can
just upgrading the sand traps

330
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,919
that more than new features on the move
okay this is the

331
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:15,119
K future here that's personal
communication devices I have talked to a

332
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,629
bunch of people here

333
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:20,089
I love this idea that I've got I can get
connected anywhere

334
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:24,178
I guess as the future I talk to some
people you really want a bill

335
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,029
like his head like if you take the idea
that people want a bill Slate PC

336
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:33,529
his spalding in the and maybe depends
got the little

337
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,909
the little man till around her in there
to visit wired

338
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:40,059
tell and don't listen there's a people
that's my

339
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,908
his real cool style so i cant

340
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:47,860
ballpoint pen which is really devices
conceptual

341
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,930
concurred good and all our communication
the whole nine

342
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,230
this is this is a anything the policing

343
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,480
all assured based thing and stuff we're
doing here is as I did you have

344
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,010
jere transceiver was a PC based in this

345
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,180
will mostly meeting and commodity
officials

346
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,570
disconcerting to do radio TV high
definition TV

347
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,340
could be take your holes get you in the
whole neighborhoods music collection

348
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,260
his plus you get deeper in the zone
license the murders on licence RFP

349
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,560
one other thing that's interesting about
the quote unlicensed

350
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,370
Sinnott and I complete

351
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,400
free throws and power switches on
depends on which it and some other

352
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,640
the correlations and really have
enormous and baggage

353
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,260
and it seemed only help for certain
couple

354
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,080
people you know we all love the 2.4
Gators case

355
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,220
unless something changes all miles to
the clinton plunges

356
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,250
was another joke about 5kg a total
amazing

357
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,280
back in the age 11 he just and

358
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,920
to the things and people me thinking
about the parliament killing Washington

359
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,600
DC right now that saying

360
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,309
action across the country that same
spectrum is available see industrial

361
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,100
scientific and medical

362
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,230
his and and they're building one at home
microwave lighting

363
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,100
interludes his pro deployment process
Washington DC

364
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,120
in places where that is termed forget
you

365
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,290
way it's not happening so what they
basically

366
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,820
the street loans that really look like
that placed on microwave ovens around

367
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,480
gets mistakes and luminance and it's a
30 percent more than the reason is

368
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,320
because there isn't more efficient

369
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,389
got but problems got a 100 watt
transmitter is

370
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,940
the jam is calls to visit some parts is

371
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,900
this and most and yeah people are really

372
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,760
is not so the other thing kinda

373
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,400
just another had technical details look
at 1.9 gave this is another

374
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,100
is a bonus and and it turns out that
this is happening right in the middle

375
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,290
PCS personal see that he's ESPN's

376
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,549
is like this ATC yes it's laced a
different carriers but

377
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,600
effectively there's a big chunk over
here this for the base station to the

378
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,220
mall

379
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,549
then there's a chance over here this for
the mobile a station

380
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,820
an unlicensed band is right in between
which is really quite

381
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,290
I mean it's pretty cool turns out that
you can't really use it

382
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,629
me that if I yeah I kids okay you gotta
buy on this item

383
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,530
so cancellation this gotta by out some
kind

384
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,730
points point way

385
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,370
Michael A

386
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,260
listen was pretty much in you releases
service of others

387
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,830
who watch later then it means I get is a
spectrum

388
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,720
yes it that's second to none Jamba
there's a container that got

389
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,850
people that don't really have a high
home service requirement

390
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,679
they can use these realizes because it's
his breakage a similar stuff taking over

391
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,730
working and then

392
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,299
while if it looks like its study the
team is generally here at least move

393
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,020
back to his victim advocate for

394
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,049
say that I recommended you have eleven

395
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,379
reasons SEC regulations Muslim on the
website

396
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,860
it pretty much more as plain English in
Canada Inc and

397
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,990
reluctant but that how they get

398
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,539
considers his injuries that okay this is
%uh

399
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:17,440
in the preaching to the choir Department
home I

400
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,590
I talked about the specific thing in for
the phone to me MPAA

401
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,340
and also large good in the audience
included a large number of Japanese

402
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
engineers

403
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,928
to his idea that that people would
actually

404
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,440
right things create actual property and
then give it away

405
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,520
was so for your head its couldn't
believe it and

406
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,799
without the names of the people or any
companies as a

407
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,370
that the Japanese they were they were
there was a of

408
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,570
and software radio-t_v_ affair

409
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,908
Arctic professional engineer he is like
ever give it away were like haha

410
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:56,860
but sorry different cultures no we we
always the win with syria

411
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,740
a their interest and so this is freezing
worrying about the free as in beer

412
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,710
and the fish is a culture of innovation
this is this is where

413
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,500
the whole three open source free
software movement the whole happening is

414
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,340
all about a culture of innovation is
like

415
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,940
what's out there how can I make it
better housing were I'm or so where can

416
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,010
we get some other way

417
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,340
home and then the various licenses

418
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,860
and and where we can see with this in a
little talk to others as how come we're

419
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,490
doing

420
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,720
HDTV receive I'm a guy who watches
icarly

421
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,630
good month I got two hours of TV I much
less person and

422
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,000
those guys overhead he had a TV only was
a bit easier

423
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,980
an hour why am i spending hours doing

424
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,380
HDTV steel political this

425
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,820
portable up to my bill devices that
allow you to do what you want

426
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,010
with this means the broadcast personally
I think it a try

427
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,090
me think what what about software you
know we had like making steel lower

428
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,299
with digital TV McCallum

429
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:03,440
the office plate what is digital TV

430
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,490
what's really happening with the little
TV is if they got some

431
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,000
transmit some it's got some modulation
strategy that what comes other receiver

432
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,650
really

433
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,220
is and had transport stream it small
close down to get multiple multiple

434
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,850
programs in this one 19 megabit chant
and it was all perfectly already

435
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,580
compressed

436
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,120
this is like no Tebow wasn't replaced
for the problem is that there was

437
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,299
however a compressed signal of

438
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:31,820
everything about this let's say I I
built-in ATSC receiving

439
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,799
but when I got is compressed and a
coming to me of a rare correct that

440
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,139
everything is really cool

441
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,630
it's kinda like program information in
there I think we're gonna be able to

442
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,659
tell when they're cutting

443
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,250
commercials also without without any
dances

444
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:51,230
so going into

445
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,080
presidency xine seem easy names I how

446
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,129
the convention transitions we get you
killed a little clue

447
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,640
that goes between are output is is going
to be

448
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,720
have the this transport streams ATSC
images

449
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,990
which is and main level and

450
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,690
within its basically looks like the DVD
stuff only is a little different there

451
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,159
is not much softer the

452
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,620
take are output make it around a little

453
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,890
and paid mayes and extensions

454
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,670
the are here they include things like
directed channel changers which is where

455
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,780
they want to personalize

456
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,740
and blasting you a citizen we figure
that

457
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,140
releases 0 director-general didn't know
that he overheard

458
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,710
so party for the time for us as we can
bill

459
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,770
the killer GV here with with really
almost left

460
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,100
once we get that once you get the
receiver than all the rest is a OG

461
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,660
popular to the desk okay school good now
play that part

462
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,880
ok a little easy a

463
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,580
free software we all know they say its
worldwide I do my pitch to the corporate

464
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,090
folks

465
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,340
know people I i do. marketing red-handed
publicly traded companies are you know

466
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,320
those those billboards all over silicon
valley that have you know I love

467
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,090
penguins

468
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,100
leary actually I don't yet see the
people making money with this

469
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,150
had to web server this is not a strange
activity

470
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,530
okay the radio its release of the divine
radio

471
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:20,940
how with what movie this is all a
platform for Sterling

472
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,340
digital communications I I don't know
I'm willing to spend some money to get

473
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,190
the lower

474
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,070
I prefer not to have to spend hundred
thousand dollars for my education

475
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,220
and moans three thousand dollars from
education really the truth this whole

476
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,770
thing was

477
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,180
I if you look at what's inside secure on
stairs

478
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,630
there's a lot 10 percent trip to about
named as India's pizza and all those

479
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,890
PSP's

480
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,340
that getting passengers with wheel
loaders

481
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,520
on a platform for experimenting with the

482
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,030
gauge we look at pagers is the cell
phones is

483
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,320
its it's really it's the sprint spectrum
their specific and Jones at home

484
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,639
its in cable movie the cable stuff it's
all on

485
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,650
it's all digital communications as well
people are going

486
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,030
their respective locations is really
more stuff from this means

487
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,290
and the things we're doing this

488
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,750
I commodity on commodity hardware no

489
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,810
you know there's a piece to this Utes
know about the distractor

490
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,168
the here important

491
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:27,779
whole country Angela Merkel to make a
point

492
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:31,080
that everybody who for at least five
years before good

493
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,689
read the papers about you know here
people a K

494
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,369
Mike wonder my wonderful from t-mobile

495
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,759
dollar hit had published a paper look at
one point eight eight

496
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:47,190
including gate level design for how to
enforce deaths and included get the

497
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,349
quotes the AC

498
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:52,408
from the sixth and merely kids you can
you could really say

499
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:55,559
I could build this device slalom skis
stuff

500
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,739
but until the largest the main building

501
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:03,200
the export regulations NJ if you look at
what happened

502
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,399
that is able to get built all the same
Dez's exportable

503
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,139
in about six weeks a good as I call the
police new

504
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:13,169
a person and as a person but it took

505
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:17,039
something to take action doing to do it
so

506
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,649
but the the downside as they don't
discuss that is a hardware that

507
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:25,919
doesn't get any faster light since so
they spend

508
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,639
bill but now it's savings and these base

509
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:33,289
it's not getting any faster by itself
yeah

510
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:36,429
personally I like the fact that AMD and
Intel like competing head-to-head

511
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:39,759
hey we bought these this fall's months
ago

512
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,809
but these dual processor nearer the time

513
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:48,489
processing you get 1800 dual processor
you have to give every day disk drive

514
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,029
all those

515
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:52,989
on the burgers other thirteen hundred
dollars for local place in like

516
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:57,599
while and that's gonna get faster and
it's already veterans

517
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,950
my learning about

518
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,070
is I had bill things using six-point the
SPD for

519
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,289
near total paid turns out with these
days

520
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:13,539
particularly the pics from these plans
in reality gaming performance and

521
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:16,749
happens and thank you for talking to
guys ATI

522
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:20,899
Korean Won devices the total you talk to
that end

523
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:24,070
yeah your call yeah we think compiler
small

524
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,049
PS any product is actually making money

525
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:32,539
was good December personal

526
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:37,359
have enough so interested in receiving a
signal

527
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,719
want this to be practical this is not
just like some nice theory

528
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:46,119
mean that I was cool and jobless grass
and you use it at all in the business

529
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:50,979
but it's not going to let in real time
and want to see my also expand its all

530
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:52,109
free software

531
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:56,369
into our previously hard for intensive
areas yeah i'm bill hartley

532
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:59,460
I have I have the japanese girl

533
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,590
to be very expensive way to get to do
that

534
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,240
that you get this funny the harbour like
the way to build something it's

535
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,730
19 weeks lead time and support the G who

536
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,610
or GE to me is two hundred thousand
dollars as opposed to

537
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,139
may remember when I was in college I
that thing about

538
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:21,799
POS software is like is how much
complexity can you manage

539
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,480
there's nothing between you and it
doesn't like if you're a civil engineer

540
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,960
name i'm talking i kno

541
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,679
wire anything about civil engineering
you want to try something out you not

542
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,090
gonna ever going to try to

543
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,509
United a bill that other you know Golden
Gate Bridge

544
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:38,220
cleverness of the universe is like yeah
I was between me and you

545
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,619
on my ability we also invite was too far
deployed a

546
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,139
and harbors kinda more on the
bridge-building

547
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:48,840
the liver that it just doesn't go as
fast fences

548
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,850
is it a so we can turn were this stuff
and a software problem

549
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,139
we're all good Angie you get more people
in the game

550
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:58,400
quick realization

551
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,470
new products can envision him

552
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,040
okay

553
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,370
so was required this sexy ass the end

554
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,699
thank you solo commodity see bastard

555
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,670
so can are as Fred more again if you
look at our website

556
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,960
the truth is bucking radio as a work in
progress he said

557
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,610
tools said while really sure tools for
at this point for people who have

558
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,740
he's a pretty serious interest %um

559
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,740
lady so we don't we're not at the stage
gave me this

560
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,430
go by this hardware and yeah well I've
got everything working anyway

561
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,020
we're doing the interesting thing for my
queen who is this

562
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,070
different use a wide I S and this means
I can do

563
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:49,020
the multi-channel applications the I
could do things I can't do that many

564
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,679
I know in the AM saying there's like
that this Pete Anderson

565
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,449
for there's a ham radio transceivers
they've got

566
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:01,529
quote DSP from the that these p.m. but
in fact they're using these people only

567
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,210
are looking so they're really funny like
a fixed-point DSP in with a conventional

568
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,440
audio codec

569
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,829
maybe one

570
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:12,890
and it is in intensive care workers now
for example if you look at any

571
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,000
real contemporary communications dept
that

572
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,150
said he said right away let's go

573
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,190
the road to the white beans postal by my

574
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,210
so raising of the show high-speed

575
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,269
relatively high speed analog to digital
converter its $20 million samples per

576
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:31,559
cent currently

577
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:34,849
just to get the idea what if there is a
bottle of them here right now hello

578
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,140
devices building

579
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,029
Indian surgeon really compressible risky
the

580
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:43,690
home they're designed for software-based
a deposit of $40 dollars

581
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,039
don't deviate Eagle sample eighty
million samples per second

582
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,750
for doing this so are ideal hard

583
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,779
good includes that kinda saying

584
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:57,829
64-bit PCI PC just keep getting faster
and faster

585
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:02,500
let me check it is this shit small FPGA

586
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,420
car you know is like a box is that again
is

587
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,819
some is going to do it and don't know

588
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:13,650
pony and now there's also the
applications

589
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,079
that people can use can you really
afford their their single channel near

590
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,609
Bandra

591
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:21,130
we've got some interesting people who
enjoy a hero the problem here

592
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,440
send patiently mock him if they were
where I have a

593
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,559
quality

594
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,739
channel that you could use existing are
you currently listening zip code

595
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:33,559
or other people are using to one step of
the audiophile

596
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,259
a your current the sentences killers

597
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:41,539
and they're still so there's some folks
will build I am here to

598
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:44,619
the moderators in in New RSR

599
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,029
employees and two the same we

600
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:51,089
that most of us are looking really
haven't

601
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:54,930
treasury-white house peter is we'll also
give it a go do that will make sure you

602
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,720
have with mister G

603
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,569
so not saying don't go there just bring
were so

604
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:04,538
those in these people may we were
supposed to think that all here's is all

605
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:07,680
go look at this kid from these people as
possible for

606
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,580
people I

607
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,960
personal attorney lotteries and

608
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,520
so involved in these people were
interested in that then your hardware

609
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,530
cost in the system

610
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,900
is a is effectively the PC already got
the sample you only got

611
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,310
plus twenty-five dollars worth no

612
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,250
G kid cited okay

613
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,850
all now is in baghdad ATSC

614
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,200
hussein's practical and it scares cat
yesterday

615
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,280
my that this for a little bit it here I
would say that it really is practical

616
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,550
for the problem is the there

617
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,170
if you look at the same ole the rate at
which the cymbals come across on the

618
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,770
digital TV's toughest 10

619
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,530
point seven six millions and as per
second most i think is that processing

620
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,110
party

621
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:00,980
happened twice that way to 21 21 22
million samples per second

622
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,170
and there's times and nearly as on 210
if I i thought id say that this

623
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,200
to get this 20 1,000,000 times

624
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,630
10 and the numbers start number if the
government

625
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,690
on things anyway for thirteen hundred
dollars you can do

626
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,830
six billion energy operations per second
this is the machines have the skill

627
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:26,308
in on their list every week at yes and
with a couple different

628
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:29,269
really get us some pretty slogans we're
doing

629
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:32,910
those are the most in this key been
floating point

630
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,859
if I R soldiers and Julia dot product
may lose

631
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:40,880
multiply accumulate to fetch is to
address is the most

632
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,380
were doing those and one cat percival

633
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,549
we can do better than that six-point

634
00:38:47,549 --> 00:38:48,290
me

635
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:53,080
strange if you look at also just to give
you an idea that he's actually

636
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,410
DSP hardware mister this is smoking yes
this is fascinating the TA

637
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,540
TI's world personal and their machines
are the names lower power

638
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,390
the painted program

639
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,930
that wetlands yeah the 6000 series part

640
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,210
the day 11 stage pipeline or lock

641
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:17,110
that you can still use us means you came
here there's no other like

642
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,190
you can make reference to all this
minutes

643
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,450
lines I believe it's simply they're
talking

644
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,320
who then send doesn't help the situation
is they had a pretty compiler

645
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,350
but we on situations in the loop system
persons and

646
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,529
till anything trying to get

647
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,550
performance and simplicity and

648
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,869
x86 is at least they always completely
is min

649
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:47,030
might have of the Moto that at least its
computing at

650
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:51,230
okay well I D and computational
requirements here

651
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,369
the 1080 interlaced this is

652
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:58,000
transport stream processing the decoder
takes about a half

653
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,859
contemporary see figure that's in the
neighborhood

654
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:05,190
me 800 mayors were the pentium

655
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:10,619
death equalizer in some movies you got
this theory that

656
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:14,700
something on the order of to a
half-billion casper sector

657
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,750
phones see video proves more about

658
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,180
but the equalizers about his remote it
happens

659
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:28,180
to particular situation way no urban
canyon in our chances never received any

660
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,480
next 20 improve the

661
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,060
for them to come back his HDTV is that
you really need an external

662
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,400
outside in 10 revenues stone to

663
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,890
back to welcome to nineteen sixty or
something and the jury decoder in here

664
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,920
for doing that for your

665
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,480
decoding for you correction it's always
good

666
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,720
million this is the second and that
again this is this

667
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,460
this applies a healing really will be

668
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,640
the same it's in the stuff weekend at
all

669
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,029
where we do its the vote because it was
close in cases where this performance

670
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,320
code is related to different processes
obeys caissons

671
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,420
possums use multiple versions December

672
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,430
so project without any alphonse it is
really no

673
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:20,430
is faster than yes lunch against classic
was often even brought along

674
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:27,550
full you know you ticket this is a site
here

675
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,930
home again this most pistols and some

676
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,339
engineering takes from consumer
electronics companies

677
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,230
okay now that we've convinced you that
maybe people with a series of

678
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:43,240
open says harder employment IP cores in
these guys demands

679
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,790
me ago PC a provision that but it s
better than real profession

680
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,370
this number is high me think it really
beautiful talking to many people

681
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,450
total cost me anything ready have

682
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,930
monthly us but this is my really local
only

683
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,330
take a quick look at the Tiki look at
the web-sites okay by today

684
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:07,040
you get this he what this case you is
this is like the the ideal

685
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,660
harbors softly the FDA decides having
building the PCI bridge

686
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,089
pieces the problem here actually in use
some

687
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:21,450
pieces in the process some stuff that
you can do channels elections

688
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,580
really trying to burn quite a few
minutes on the PC

689
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:29,860
if the authorities yet

690
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,040
period it's a PC

691
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,009
let's play more and more is PC the

692
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:39,700
heard is

693
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,050
all the easy way to find this there's a
mainly losses archives

694
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,810
there's a home page years luxury home
page the easy way

695
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:51,890
getting real one word in the Google Inc
said we've gotten lots of the

696
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,089
fairly active is about 40 people
actively developing

697
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,530
the the product message was unable to be
here today

698
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,870
his he's got his own which is just
leaving

699
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,490
and great guy he's done a budget and
your stuff with designed

700
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,320
phone calls my modulation changes he had

701
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,870
and again yeah I ATSC this is a great

702
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,359
a great many great happiness really
people are saying no you can't do it

703
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,700
alone working

704
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,950
how hard can it be let me tell you this
but

705
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,460
the problems immunity he's usually
policies and

706
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,030
allegedly specs were you know it's like
most sheltered

707
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:34,250
testator's here the specs for the ATSU

708
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,690
years UK is a test vectors there's no

709
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,080
there so things to your interpretation
there's really no

710
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,310
clear-cut it had to go one way or the
other so there's cases but we don't the

711
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,160
whole transmitter

712
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,379
alongside the sea they were able working
top down from satellite and other

713
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,870
transfers a.m. pay

714
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,930
in pastry made YouTube videos for
download

715
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:00,310
and then what kaelin the back up this
way and at the same time working for me

716
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:00,970
and had

717
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:05,060
towards sources on the Internet up
towards the ending was it

718
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,650
the to we've got some no

719
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,320
good got no the transmitter output those
communities

720
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,450
capture of commercialism equipment

721
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,680
noon to improve your me has another
claim that behind it but

722
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,649
means from want these be no its to late
for me its

723
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:26,590
the truth and

724
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,610
for with in general leaving

725
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,870
the to the transmitters and much easier

726
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,430
the receiver we we have what we have
sought

727
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,399
the harbor that we have right now the
only ABC's there's no their cards

728
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,820
available that will transmit

729
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,480
other was hasty has been delayed cars
are very intense

730
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,290
they will go we got enough problems
making this year is that what is her

731
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,020
problem

732
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,640
and he this place to dodged all the way
to achieve the same the entrance fee

733
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,140
Indies when and any any places we can
transmit

734
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,779
I mean we can transmit in the later
there it's there

735
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,270
to plan for gay and then this gets into
the whole SEC

736
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:16,540
South way you proposing the SEC at least
up technology

737
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,290
police believe for we have will put in
the face what about and service

738
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,670
stands to in Jersey City

739
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:32,070
yeah

740
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:36,330
yeah

741
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:41,348
well this is this okay here's that we
haven't talked yet

742
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:44,670
the reality we're really talking box
turtles

743
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,510
I mean if we built a hole like skin we
have not put together a whole

744
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,119
application

745
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,930
looks like a scam everything else can we
could be completed say

746
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,779
left off the USA do that to you I mean
this year's this is the reality in

747
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,599
situations of

748
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,050
to me this is a there is a that if there
is a breakdown in the old thinking

749
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,230
you know this is like a paradigm shift
that we're now getting a place where

750
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,830
people who have applied and I'm white
and her you know I

751
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,720
in OK I'm getting crushed the cultural
innovation because at some

752
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,359
some lot on the standby SIM cellphone
manufactures really want to really fix

753
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:24,040
the problem instead insisting the
problem they created the forum

754
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,660
espionage and Harley thou shalt not kill

755
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:34,660
sold here receives kein she doesn't have
a mic

756
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:43,160
yeah don't just better

757
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,940
mind he's the top his personal

758
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,780
which is any point getting close which
is intelligent

759
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,050
for specially see mean their man's

760
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,580
years his response

761
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,200
Q factors lol chance lech yet the closer
the better

762
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,850
mean it's a trap so the closer we get
the better

763
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:10,240
right now the analog to digital
converters are limiting pieces today

764
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,760
this for me wages occurred problem it
turns out they were clear on this and

765
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,800
other than because those guys all

766
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,650
power control well places where it's
really hard it is awfully well as the

767
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:22,350
situation

768
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,540
which think the easy things like
broadcast here well you know

769
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,970
you might be yes five miles from the
50,000 what trends

770
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,280
Ryan meanwhile tribalism guidance 160
miles away

771
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,290
my business and that's happening across
the country I get his aide-de-camp with

772
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,790
new babies get forty

773
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,820
that's right he's gay the other
apologizing Burnett building

774
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,040
it's really helpful

775
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,620
is needed the converters the whole thing
and the

776
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,500
basis during a sampling president was
being with you really need your

777
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,200
application to do with the call it has
been sampling which is i

778
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,290
basic direct from rstrnt something I can
feel me

779
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,960
a/d converter we have to be going the
harbour using

780
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,290
is a cable TV to with me

781
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,100
family because it workers cheap off the
shelves get this

782
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,080
it spells it will tune is designed for
cable modems

783
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,290
bill team from 15 a Saturday his

784
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,160
and is good evidence that the health
service began to birds tend to say

785
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:25,830
things

786
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:30,029
5.75 competent it's about a

787
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,950
as well and between example diversity

788
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:37,510
polled that was really weird reread
creating

789
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:43,910
student leader

790
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,749
did well you to see the band has a
sampling

791
00:48:47,749 --> 00:48:54,749
his uniquely no need to be settling at
twice the bandwidth

792
00:48:56,749 --> 00:49:00,349
interests okay this is this thing
working this is like if you look at what

793
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:01,170
they're doing

794
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,559
it's not if I don't my game the interest
is always do I love it

795
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,730
way up here I still like to see twice
this plot

796
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,299
this imposition corner cases if this
thing works out

797
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:14,549
its present how much I want to deal with
the same time and then

798
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:18,700
had leveled up next to make any sense
okay

799
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,960
I your example is this is a shitty

800
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,720
DT the BC who lead watch this scene

801
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,430
the mall the example chittick

802
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:31,450
him intended

803
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,839
clinton's yell that the summer

804
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:38,130
processor consumption or last name

805
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:43,059
armed have a look at it in detail

806
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:46,480
yeah I think that the 802 level is
politics more

807
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,730
more process but the Bluetooth hopson
much

808
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:55,559
players reasons also if he had to DSP
said

809
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,920
June theoretically saying on tune into
this way over here

810
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,130
this way here's that rainy TDs he's play
heroes in processes for them

811
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,579
process rather questions the also want
to get some

812
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,200
ever ever seen from here hey let's kick
it won't let me have it I like it its

813
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,849
present

814
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:17,339
the deal with with the IRS this weekend
I have and what this

815
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:20,589
it however while we can get SolidWorks
certainly

816
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:24,140
realistically like a as well with the
local to the

817
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,250
Analog Devices parts we could get

818
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:32,410
we could see a follow up to him all taba
is everything together forty minutes

819
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:36,210
for me has one child yeah want to get
this big

820
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:39,589
is a big as I can sample eighty million
samples per second

821
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:43,420
their sixteen-day samples typically and
now I don't have any ideas anything

822
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:43,890
therefore

823
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,078
for some so I get my head injuries as
well

824
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,700
you when you processes key were that his
brother

825
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,029
K taken okay

826
00:50:55,029 --> 00:50:58,829
key lime I really along I wanna get it
this is great

827
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:02,190
will be available to talk after really
is here

828
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:06,500
said there's a the baby DJ is the
broadcast protection

829
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,250
discussion no other copy-protection
technology which is what happens

830
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,829
see do you go to blog style

831
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:20,170
ESL there's a there's a there's a web
login here that's called consensus

832
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,240
lawyer really spells out in gory detail
what

833
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,460
happen the sure short the high quality
steel

834
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,630
the the content

835
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,670
people mostly the folks are saying hey
we're not going to lose any content

836
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,700
less we can keep people from making
copies other doing what they like

837
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,480
it's a slow steady much so what they
want to do is a while said

838
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,789
in the sand transport streams chest in
the clear broadcast in 3d

839
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:51,900
wanna say bit in this chess players from
that they're calling the broadcast

840
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,609
then they want to do is they want to
have a look at some electronics

841
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:58,990
folks honor this bit this is the house
of God

842
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,200
anyone passing laws banning
non-compliant receivers

843
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,619
to this is a three-part strategy now

844
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:10,630
I had the invitation yes I went down to
this meeting talk to businesspeople

845
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,849
like the nicest people I've ever met
wanna chill can't

846
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:17,880
that very long really lovely people

847
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,279
it's a gay you and you get it's like
site lawyer

848
00:52:21,279 --> 00:52:26,109
technology guy where to go to get been
considered using that

849
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:31,730
thats what they're up to yeah please
anything more they say that

850
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,230
yeah did this soliciting public comments

851
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:39,529
this big public workshop they're gonna
have on Wednesday in Washington

852
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:43,380
Commerce Department honors technology
administration

853
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,960
the a/c for the Department of Commerce
the

854
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,960
great you'll find that their very good
thank you K

855
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,089
I'm gonna move on to the permanent
specimen

856
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:07,920
one exactly that BP's years in what
they're trying to do right now

857
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,080
arm basically there is some you

858
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,460
have cttw GE which is a copyright

859
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,359
for you and this is also headed by 5c
companies

860
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:22,549
spicy companies being amortization five
companies including

861
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,780
Itachi Intel tissue this me and

862
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,410
much you see here and basically they've
been created to

863
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,950
like this said address this problem BT
digital copies

864
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:37,150
content so basically they have no bylaws
industry

865
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:42,000
it's theoretically an open group there
been lawyers are then technologist they

866
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,560
often sitting in on these discussions
says

867
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,740
late last year but strangely enough
these five companies who have founded

868
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,300
the group

869
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,740
are the only ones in the end his parties
have been

870
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:58,150
approved by this working with so that's
your first deposit

871
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,260
some going on here something strange
little

872
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:05,690
something's not right and these people
have all these great technologies

873
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,740
have any you can receive and transmit
NEC daily

874
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,160
and these people are going to make its
that that's not really going to be the

875
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,859
case

876
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:18,430
for instance right now with and long TV
you didn't receive

877
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:21,500
anything which Washington copy to the
CIA

878
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,950
do what you want but 20 he goes digital

879
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:29,040
that's not going to be the case so for
instance

880
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,330
are in 2006 is

881
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:36,040
eighty-five percent in the consumer
market to receive digital signals

882
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,700
TV is going to go did saw to GATT

883
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,099
will you stay so here's a problem with
that these companies got together

884
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:48,030
and they said men problem were people
tire yourself

885
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:52,760
we want people to lost our content MTA
basically says

886
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,900
what people lost our content the way we
want to be lost

887
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,589
when we want to be lost so here's a
problem

888
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:03,570
they wanted address three issues and
basically

889
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,609
they wanted to cover recording

890
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:10,990
they wanted to cover it the ways that
three devices full

891
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,859
basically get approved and they once
made everything tamper-proof and

892
00:55:14,859 --> 00:55:15,819
tamper-resistant

893
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,160
this is going to thinking this is wanted
to tear things

894
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,399
like the radius from being able to exist
so here's how they're going to address

895
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:24,880
it

896
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,280
they're saying every digital
transmission is going to be broadcast

897
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,349
like there are 140 pretenses

898
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:35,730
and began his every frame and if they're
somewhat

899
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:40,220
in this transmission that means can hear
record it can't be copied it can be

900
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:40,750
reduced

901
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:47,750
be distributed if they see yes

902
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:52,470
promises not to transmit anywhere accept
another

903
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:56,440
provides sorry it seems like a cartel
this is really a virgin islands

904
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:02,830
cross patent cross-licensing the yes
eating corn to improve technologies

905
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:06,520
via you're pretty limited and very much
more limited

906
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,339
much you can do with which is accorded
them what's going on their second

907
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:15,020
point that they won't address it they
wanted slide in the catalog call

908
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:19,190
weights sounds a little off but if you
go to the FSA

909
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,240
there's a rate a pretty to me about this
issue

910
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,330
it basically means that I am there's
this

911
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:29,000
and uses threat to digital media let's
say I'm

912
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,300
he has answered digital media you can
pocket onto

913
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,300
some headlong media and then back into
digital like

914
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,810
this additionally he really needs to be
protected

915
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:43,210
and some users and then he is saying oh
wait hold on a second me

916
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,820
we thought this issue alls legacy I
think it's going to

917
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,849
circumvent this and final things and
don't want to control

918
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:55,540
period here basically they're saying
well be digital copy someone to get out

919
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,250
there somehow lost control

920
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,740
gotta control not only to control
everything

921
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,290
also to future software basically that's
not going to happen so

922
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,609
interestingly control computers in one
control and wanted

923
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:12,339
burners and they want prominent and so

924
00:57:12,339 --> 00:57:16,710
his office is bad but I'll just say very
quickly throughout history technology

925
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:17,680
from his

926
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,990
also team have been allowed to innovate
you've got

927
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,480
kennels you got radio you've got
suddenly TV

928
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,150
look what happened Wed industries

929
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,390
were regulated what happened to the fact
that failed

930
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:36,359
CD CD small regulated CD CD technology
takeoff Betamax

931
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:40,440
Betamax is regulated PCR is very huge
success today

932
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,560
basically this is the first case %uh
technology companies

933
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,410
Guinea into the NCAA giving into
industry and saying

934
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,580
well 22 haha I'll try and compromise

935
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,799
historically this is allowed parties

936
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,780
care sleep at the week after so

937
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,790
basically projects like the radio full

938
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,000
not be allowed under the PDT I am

939
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,720
in also in short staffer

940
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,160
3 software it frustrates fair use

941
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,250
faster innovation spot competition

942
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,420
and basically the system a digital
television

943
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,660
adaptation marketplace so

944
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,830
basically we

945
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:28,310
need to stop this arm in this the CDC

946
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:31,619
final report was just releasing read it
on the you

947
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:34,780
website and basically

948
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,630
now this report is going to go to
congress up by the way

949
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:42,630
Microsoft Billups I would not part of
the original

950
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,260
processing in accys meetings and they
have filed

951
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,130
report saying he did not support best so

952
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:54,010
shows there are other companies out
there for trying to fight this

953
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:58,290
but you should find out about the MTG
find out about digital TV on all these

954
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,310
issues

955
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,560
because it's going to go to congress and

956
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,770
this something meeting hot sauce so that
means for

957
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:10,400
innovative software like are thank you
very much we miss you

958
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:17,010
%ah

959
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:20,490
yeah I'll be in a back rub down the
hallway and will

960
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,930
will take questions and responding to
questions about the topical stuff

961
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,770
so the effect whatsoever politics and
are getting ready and it's of course

962
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,470
there

963
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,520
a mile long
