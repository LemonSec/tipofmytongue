00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,650
in I'm interested in topic and a

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,750
on

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,970
a few years ago 02 March bunch of other
New York

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,049
up to Joel college football

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,390
went down to lobby Congress in protest
at the SCI

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,710
the lower today it was fun there's a lot
of work we went down there with Flyers

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,410
T-shirts woodstock people who try to
explain we're on about

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,699
waco and and we'd say oh well

12
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:42,250
10 lines later they say who's got
computers to

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,080
it just was or so when I'm working on
his

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,229
propaganda happened onus on the civil
side

15
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,640
on the let's play my cause my purpose

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,049
I'm usually in Cleveland I and

17
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:00,350
so I have a lot on something I i think
is right on the far far left

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,940
it'll markets I think I'm probably would
go

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,070
intentionally Hollywood girl to the last

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,140
are I'll well as people

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,200
and just say logically as well says

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,539
purely a process displaying what I'm
doing here with promises

23
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:21,119
this goes for a fire brimstone they have
a certain way

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,119
sorrow -2 given technical presentations
for them

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,399
I it's the first keeping one's the
government is to get out the music

26
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,219
business

27
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:43,219
were into it one or the other we talk
about the little hard

28
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:48,329
were generally months or basing talking
about Monday

29
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,890
understanding of what what that stuff is
in the past

30
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,200
here's my vision for that stuff is in
there passage

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,119
the founders wrote the Copyright Clause
it to them

32
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,250
us working as they did so they conjured
up in industry

33
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,170
there there was no electoral party

34
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,340
industry of and it was created from
scratch

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,200
in that moment guarantee through these
things in life a problem

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,380
which doesn't exist number two founders
created

37
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,680
government policy towards the Arts aside
from that the First Amendment free

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,510
speech that pretty much

39
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,709
is no other government policy worth arts
really

40
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,799
this is called to have effect that

41
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,720
I'll that

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,900
they created industry to administer the
Arts only half the time

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,260
now

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,600
we want where we are now because

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,920
isn't working the reason is working that
israel has the power come

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,160
find it but not the kill the bill so its
political speech format

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,519
Justin community also carries with no he
has a front pages

48
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,310
don't use lines I'm I have elected

49
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,630
government's got music business once
again well you're

50
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,130
the problem says not allowed with others
were the popular closet into things

51
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,209
the controversy industry s there and
their staffs government policy towards

52
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:19,850
the arts

53
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,350
this isn't working and the reason isn't
working that industry has the power

54
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,190
government behind it but not the
accountability the result

55
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,319
is that the people by which I mean you
know the people things in the

56
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,269
declaration

57
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:38,760
and couple hours on are subject to
regulation without having a voice

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,940
yet what the regulators still a

59
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,959
and as a result we have is a
anti-democratic

60
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,590
institutions the actual system that
sucks working it's doing its thing

61
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,100
prolly

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,280
this is a democratic matters so

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,130
what makes a democratic so there's
collusion between governments

64
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,228
they steal all in government and
industry is the same way as is a wall

65
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,979
between

66
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,620
you know any other I important parties

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,290
in the forces the Macomb and their
business coalitions

68
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,859
when democracy breaks down is there's
collusion

69
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,760
with both parties are the recourse is
for the people

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,750
to forcibly remind the government his
always say this very specifically

71
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,000
that force

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,520
is a real thing is a useful thing that's
the way things work

73
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,880
and dollar

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,900
it is the way democracy works to the
people have to

75
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,419
not ask the government to do the right
thing but

76
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,948
talent government does the people's
bidding

77
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,380
unwillingly as a little what's new in
your car

78
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,740
your government pays ambitious those
because people

79
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,300
Davis keepers the deadly ambitious the
pretty hardcore

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,530
no they are to yeah

81
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,139
where they do that Darby the world
government always strains against

82
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:06,940
democracy

83
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,650
always has to be forced you it doesn't
look a little

84
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,620
was to be elected from life the arts
only a danger

85
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,840
political careers politicians

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,650
strategically attack we need to keep the
arts as far away as possible

87
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,120
are asking you not think December as a
France

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,370
presence right supporters alike the
selflessness

89
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,570
none so to keep the Arts at arm's length

90
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,349
a politicians established this

91
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,580
its proxies to do with its first parties
are not democratic institutions

92
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,250
parties on in the government

93
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,789
norad when the founders established

94
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,740
party by Internet policy it was the arts
he created

95
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,770
not just in industry the super industry
this special powers

96
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,270
when the founders wrote the Copyright
Clause abdicate their responsibility

97
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,750
to make the government which is
responsible to the voters

98
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,400
and also paranoid no makeup conspiracy
theory

99
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,160
I mean to say is that on history

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,639
has for a has

101
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,689

and as it is

104
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:28,210
survivor die according to the rules it

105
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,330
a catchy sure memorable your sexy

106
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,469
on a lot of things that help them word
of

107
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,789
that stuff the Constitution on and then
there are three games

108
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,068
with actual real things I'll

109
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,870
and I'm sorry are

110
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,169
yes in there are other is the reality
reality is this thread institutions

111
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,430
to its land ownership arm buildings

112
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,849
investments mentorships you know
purposes really enjoy the career for

113
00:06:58,849 --> 00:06:59,210
life

114
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,289
the whole a long time and then you teach
an apprentice and so on and so on

115
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,878
voiceless missile history is made up
said as long

116
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,339
was chill against staying with the same

117
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,740
overtime you have judicial precedents

118
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,029
or the reality really like him

119
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:22,139
really like to party it stands for the
thread

120
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,500
institutions that have been linked I

121
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,210
as a series is businesses on since

122
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,939
since the rite of passage sister house
its

123
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,689
room social problems a this thread

124
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,770
is a specific industries since these
institutions are specific industry

125
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,029
not any other industry they're not the
digital industry

126
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,500
they're not not a little problems not
the artisans

127
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,879
the exact one so

128
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,399
level and on where we gonna this moment
his

129
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,020
just by I what you expected on ones that
the industry was created by the

130
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,620
government protected by a

131
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,879
deliberately on guess you will like this

132
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,270
the yet the idea that

133
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,750
I lobster or the dot constant getting

134
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,500
p with them is fundamentally wrong it we
can go core

135
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,860
ask for special privileges you were
going to ask the have nots to survive

136
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,919
loses is wrong this is de facto

137
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,680
illegal to

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,740
I'll the music industry i think im sry

139
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,339
on this is part the same industries and
operates in shadows

140
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,569
I'll so along with the tobacco

141
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,599
I'll see alcohol sex industry

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,620
drugs gambling on its

143
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,300
its it works in citrus sale for example
Journal heard anything about

144
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,620
martial music industry music this is how
they're really working inside

145
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,440
any reason large business on 05 pretty
much nothing

146
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,329
with clothes go to the website universal

147
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:07,230
you're staying up by of public relations
these are not the whole

148
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,420
let's unlike a lot of other businesses
and

149
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,140
are it is secretive

150
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,380
its its only with sleazy lives on

151
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,949
chaos on it it doesn't actually sound

152
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:26,529
it says artisans and get this morning
with music it says

153
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,630
give us money and we won't see get this
money will hurt

154
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,220
that's the item price and

155
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,230
example this is ask with the music
lessons organizations

156
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,220

164
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,380
nothing to Marx's for suddenly summit
when Mike

165
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,800
after a learns lessons which we saw and

166
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,990
I'll and like I think for both

167
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,790
the same thing when I happens there was
a huge are the

168
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,380
composition that a little party that was
a look at it said on

169
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,579
the yes to on as a Jonjo or

170
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,290
armed Leszek on also agree that we're
losing

the that hackers on that's a

176
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,410
you are relatively mild climates it's
pretty good I think states this fall

177
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,490
and its totally on point

178
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,730
is because a quote about the same
distance particular

179
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,829
the signal is just a tree

180
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,370
the other way because it's likely the
hospital other intellectual property

181

vibrant public to me

184
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,699
we believe are losing or or lease on a
place where we're gonna kill the laws

for existing

189

harsh inspires nobody disagrees

195
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,390
I love this point all liking this people
who agree with

196
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,630
and posturing is not parse and

197
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,250

there's no reason to my

200
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:30,760
the courts the legislature the public
said

201
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,339
is what matters is what they do what
they do

202
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,829
makes a burqa clear that they care who
the winners of

203
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:44,290
and that morality is going to go to the
wheels

204
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,120
the IT industry is too big to fail
russians

205
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,750
are is not sure you have the government
give us permission to get in there and

206
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,899
do we want to do

207
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,620
is to determine genetic

208
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,559
so unless it says the correct because
the Constitution is about a balance

209
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,699
is fooling himself the public has never
had

210
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,809
constitutionally mandated low to a
vibrant

211
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:11,219
public to me with the public has had his
incidental benefits

212
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,779
arts policy the government contract out
to a specific industry

213
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,270
the options there's no sick industry

214
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,730
there is no artisans those days baby
says

215
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,679
haha I live performances sale
instruments and sheet music

216
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,770
by living wage for getting lessons I

217
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,449
Bosphorus halfway decent way but that's
not the industry or think there is a

218
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,809
high PST

219
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,540
happens do pay the bills file
relationship with ours

220
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,189
rentals the common cause is not about
balance

221
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:50,189
the situation is always been on his way

222
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,730
so the situation is right now is what
you get from the combination of secrecy

223
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,019
& privilege: this building

224
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,129
popular across archer this himself
dealer

225
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:05,239
self-dealing means it membership because
the products

226
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:08,980
first our I'll is the most important
value the IPS

227
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,209
so with the recent decisions as far as a

228
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,290
yet radio this the scenes

229
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,639
upon %um with us

230
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,579
they realize when others that net radio
is not hard that industry

231
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,579
purpose the public because is not
tankers the Arts

232
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:30,100
workers radio sticky Nike industrial of

233
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,139
courts or thinks this

234
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,449
because they are right 6 the copyright
with the public cause as the

235
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,100
constitution says

236
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,569
industry electoral not products

237
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:49,379
this not the upward that is guaranteed
by the Constitution I think the

238
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:50,899
Holocaust in order to

239
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,980
blah blah blah congress has a party to
you

240
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,629
rights its in order to is not a mandate

241
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,910
not telling the truth the courts

242
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,209
not required to follow that in order to
promote progress in the arts

243
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:08,489
missile sites the courts holiday to

244
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:11,769
allow the congress and great
intellectual

245
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:18,220
as a very differences

246
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,800
and this is arbitrarily the music
industry

247
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,910
a key issue is no obligation Park they
can do what he wants

248
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,939
again music labels

249
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,590
to offer downloadable music because they
don't have to not responsible public

250
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,960
private other well

251
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,820
despite all this will go pretty good
leverage for so far

252
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,830
well agree with the gloominess a lot of
people I think we're actually

253
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,430
doing pretty good with internet which
does not suck

254
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,360
this file sharing it's really pretty
popular everybody's got their cheers

255
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,990
applause for people out there

256
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,880
I'll so we're making progress yeah I
think these are the people in powerful

257
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,980
we're not that we think that there is a
special or hate us

258
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,530
all all the way for so we need to crush
the opposition but

259
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,160
force so it's good contributed yes

260
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,890
it's good to write letters to congress
and demonstrating is a fun thing to do

261
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,689
but that's not I'll hackers world ac/dc

262
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,330
a digital politics people to raise money
for

263
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,980
for funds it's like pulling teeth the
contributor 150 times

264
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,460
amid and the truth is that everybody in
the audience is happy to go

265
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,839
don't stop unhappy to go on

266
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,960
call the congressman right cars join the
ACM

267
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,880
on all is really not the way we r where
we operate

268
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,350
is that we build stuff well we need to
keep doing

269
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,170
is keeping building stuff the only thing
wrong with what we're doing

270
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:58,170
is a couple small offense listings is

271
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,250
building stuff the more aggressively
political future said are

272
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,619
is an effective way to to work so here's
a few examples

273
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,339
mister that i'm looking for. for
Hansen's I might actually get in the end

274
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,060
arounds

275
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,159
hacks about talk about minute like

276
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,310
for example I so

277
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,859
launches okay so with his bowl physical
capital toys

278
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,929
that have a political on impact on that
note deliberately

279
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:31,990
political Taurus well these things they
have it with some with few friends

280
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,160
which is a on file-sharing Murray that

281
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,550

282
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,220
share files what we do is water each
others houses to bring a hard drive

283
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,060
the funeral hour person posting money as
a as a

284
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,280
Bihar are Liverpool you know I

downloads in person to the head

287
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,540
yeah affects is this are its fine social

288
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,409
its totally believe attack I

289
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,550
was the cops a certain somebody in your
private home were drinking beer and

290
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,840
barbecue with your friends

291
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,449
the administrators and other than this
legally

292
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,000
urine a the merits

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,610
stock transfer all is discuss I haven't
we take home final kids

294
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,750
night a good stuff with recommendations

295
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,289
comments like no idea what that sucks

296
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:34,730
this is a technical political

297
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,340
by we we accomplish

298
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,000
not mass share that it's gone

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,590
terrifying to our yes attendees

300
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,610
does a lot of stuff you that over over
over over a hour

301
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,179
you know good broadband connections a
larger than its good job

302
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,309
you're not a bother dollars this because
of the concern

303
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:05,309
yet

304
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,290
well I think that the think the did a
pretty good question

305
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,470
sir so I think the key play

306
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,510
this is gonna sound a little class but
the key point is legal because I think

307
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,590
the law hard

308
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,770
this on and I think that this is it
doesn't wanna

309
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,280
what matters is are you gonna get lost
the hots for the community because

310
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,990
yet that mister doesn't want to have but
isn't there

311
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,410
your thoughts breaking down front door
that there will be a lot more

312
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,310
comfortable about

313
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,060
your on kisses only have a single

314
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,899
on if you have a I think your cool party

315
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,650
your loftis within a radius were called
trucks laden is its

316
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,130
your whole night on will be pretty green
pretty cool you know if they're

317
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,280
and and the consular go with it we look
good and get a licence

318
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:17,280
he answers worth

319
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,040
full

320
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:35,040
friends at the collection yeah

321
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,470
so on it's a success

322
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,110
so it is put these things that is a
political and tactical

323
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,559
by Rd and with is discussed

324
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,418
this as kevin said to me after
Wednesday's

325
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,659
email me the next day said okay well I
got on

326
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:55,770
tailgates for a ride on the subway here
back

327
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,129
to life through play kick ass cable

328
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,380
as a political hack is it really scary

329
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,049
position it was by the product's so look
for years

330
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:10,889
are using their inventiveness you have
to do what's

331
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,179
arts world leaders say ask you which is
flyer

332
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,750
sign petitions I'll kidney action is
factors

333
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,510
your actions what we do well on the only
thing that given the

334
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,780
is applied creativity more directly more
aggressively yeah

335
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,010
got I house

336
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,830
no about

337
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,649
well

338
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,650
County old

339
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,400
writer talks about it yeah

340
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,860
I think we all fall on

341
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,410
a another another similar to a political
capital hot

342
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,540
on years then called afraid

343
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,330
you got any your projects mitterrand
catching at your friend knows that

344
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,409
it is know it is it's this file sharing
our

345
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,540
so it's about down down low stock levels

346
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,920
list every year miles and the difference
is that only connect your friends

347
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,050
should never have connections somebody's
phone number

348
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,330
email addresses Stacy don't know you got
a little

349
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,810
right and so from there it's all just
fun ecology

350
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,810
on there's a lot of interesting moms
network month

351
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,929
for example yes this extremely to liaise
with going your funds are low

352
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,600
you cash assistance there himself

353
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,930
problems but a by I'm

354
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:51,160
the net result political levels it's a
cell structure I sent you one used in

355
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,090
true evil

356
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,669
with 20 treatable which would you choose
good I R pose for sure he will work

357
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,670
great with what's good

358
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:03,180
we had stronger the cell structure the
nearly impossible abrasion so

359
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,290
to enforce that way technology lucky and
not

360
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,360
traditionally political things are

361
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:17,360
positive political on things to do thank
you

362
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,710
all right

363
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:32,710
rise power all

364
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,100
all

365
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,750
yeah

366
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,289
and indeed they're completely justified
to do that

367
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:51,289
right so

368
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,080
great

369
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,780
way to enable you to Tracy I is not
getting any more

370
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:04,440
here the hell likely watch TV you're
seeing friends I can do that like on

371
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,810
ahead a little ways to go a sorry

372
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,480
to I'll

373
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,380
its or do a pretty good but we force
little

374
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,520
ok other when it should be there are
thoughtful I hate sauce

375
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,510
on reading list call this is how we have
operated

376
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,010
we need to keep doing what we need to do
is what's out there what we're doing

377
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,560
right now

378
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,940
to small differences the first one is on
a political

379
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,950
ethical hacking always on and secondly
is

380
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,510
with stuff I apologize and you'll I
still get

381
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,879
I really don't get you know I know a
buddy who feels

382
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,670
moral our files steel I

383
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,730
who've been at the center less everybody
asking

384
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,920
forty-five minutes mean everything could
stay home

385
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,560
you think it's a lonely they just think
it's the mass killings

386
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,600
you know knowing that if you like
mysteries

387
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,630
yeah I think it's really cool fun way
with

388
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:11,150
spill is it if you don't have to save a
few let's say they feel file sharing is

389
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,630
that

390
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,810
people and this makes no sense in the
world because we're shooting ourselves

391
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,790
in the past so that is ridiculous

392
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:24,270
it to stop good as if what we're doing
the crucial

393
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,800
Isshiki Colin ridiculously long URL

394
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,400
every cast is real property rights

395
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,750
mean anything at all people should
especially have a ride

396
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,670
he is the very body ingrained to solve
problems

397
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,700
create products and such for the cell on
restrained by the normally powers

398
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,090
which some other entities trying to
exercise real

399
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,510
often rises with this thing's for front
know our

400
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,040
are

401
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,000
obstructions a property rights some
hardened you a local doctor

402
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,320
and the police quarters that there's
opposition

403
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,260
between these abstract property rights
that there we call it a little problem

404
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,710
we'll probably likes we have

405
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,800
powerful real are

406
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,400
right she knew to you on to true
polymers

407
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,470
its boost electrical and there's nothing
to apologize for their

408
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:28,130
10 from to from Anderson's likud

species shared

415
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,580
some deals he's

it moved

418
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:12,289
you are not losing anything suree

419

return kids action of giving with the

420
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,049
the ideological missus is it's true it's
important

421
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:24,369
but is also easy on

422
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:28,090
that the job once you are absolutely
right

423
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,399
literacy comparison because of course of
as well

424
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:36,730
some fierce is very simple his little
bit year everyone

425
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,159
star break

426
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,580
us I will probably foster

427
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,230
much in the ether that the

428
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,970
that the moral justification for a
little problem is now I'll

429
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,669
versus with your opposition uses that as
gilded

430
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,850
sauce the the real on world

431
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,710
haitian horrors that on net like
apartments goods

432
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,340
well another I'll do them what's the
best games

433
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,149
another sheet music moral justification
just as saying

434
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:13,359
he's if it doesn't cost you anything

435
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,499
to share Moss most people that's

436
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:22,090
but not funny see

437
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,450
culture assertion place

438
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,080
less that's what file sharing is a for
sure

439
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,149
the point is that his virtuous to show
through friends

440
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:36,450
doesn't virgins okay with that time

441
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,679
here comes the barn burning conclusion

442
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,340
we all agree the file sharing is a
virtue pretty much hassling

443
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,779
that's true even if your friends should
do it other anyway

444
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:53,779
spice about so it's pretty clear that
little actual property

445
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:58,539
is evil evil

446
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,320
it's a good fucking apologizes

447
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,619
file-sharing not stealing

448
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:09,509
its freedom fighting it is decided

449
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:12,970
good nobility and the Knights the
roundtable

450
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,739
we are real actual people

451
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:21,429
opposition are not people only say that
sucks

452
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:25,239
me say that opposition is not the
employees at the hype he is

453
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:31,409
is the industry itself the employees to
go find new jobs in the babysitters the

454
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:32,499
collateral sprawl

455
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:35,509
what our way

456
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:39,639
the industry irate see

457
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:46,639
IIIi and

458
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:54,039
I'm sorry I love having shells I love
having chosen based on this causes

459
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:57,099
I'm absolute for look at the end

460
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:01,389
and its

461
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:04,369
we are real actual opposition

462
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:08,730
is not people is in this the employees
the industry can go elsewhere

463
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,740
industry there's all along all year
after year

464
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,320
and century after century design houses
in between us

465
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,899
humans in the natural environment we
have more rights

466
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:23,610
opposition us that's why we are freedom
fighters

467
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,820
our interests when the freedom to hustle
for ourselves

468
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,879
at basic right self-preservation

469
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:35,139
is a basic right it doesn't you with me

470
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:38,619
it happens written on this we don't need
anybody

471
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:43,440
offer a generous and everything taken
away from us influential party demands

472
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,049
that we not mind our own self
preservation that's why

473
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:51,639

and power it's about cartel hasn't

490

Britain because she can really take care
of urself the Backstreet Boys are doing

498
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:41,880
far

499
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,030
and all the other artists or moves

500
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:50,430
or over the point kill

501
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,570
he had a cat the artists we can be
threatened

502
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,840
yours because we only artists whose

503
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,790
from when they're third talking about
the arts

504
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,270
there together earlier yeah the
harpsichord

505
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,670
let's stop isn't there more we other
people

506
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:12,410
on the creative public domain do stuff
personal time

507
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,740
nights and weekends applying tell
knocking off back to raise

508
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,970
glory on personal satisfaction static
satisfaction

509
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,540
we r as far as constitution is concerned
artists

510
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,780
sold people say that what we're doing is
threatening

511
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:34,780
artists can't be right we were the bars

512
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,610
the week so I hope that the artists

513
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,669
it's how to protect ourselves from the
Hokies

514
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:47,269
our historic of cancer

515
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:50,559
to quit fucking hard as

516
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,100
it's a real struggle politics is a true
fights is not provide

517
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,340
as a lot around us is not the first she
is the cheese is money

518
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,169
stuff that matters the people's really
carer who want something she's

519
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:08,179
it's because it is serious business

520
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,599
worse is the way things get on other

521
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,720
our callers of reason for us and they
use it everyday

522
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,730
we're in a power struggle resort
democratic up

523
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,760
the reason surpassed officer democratic
on

524
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,980
that the ideal no actual bottom as
creative forces

525
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,119
which are powerful enough to threaten
democratic process

526
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,060
and if the court see what they're doing
archer or bizarre things

527
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:43,259
that's wrong because the courts are
doing exactly what they are expected to

528
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,649
do

529
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,699
given that intellectual property must

530
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,510
it intellectual property is a valid
concept

531
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,480
in with the court saddam what the CETP a

532
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,819
is when all I wanna be's want to do to
us

533
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:02,849
what palladium is is okay is
constitutionally enshrined

534
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:06,859
you can one or the other but if you
accept I P

535
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:10,240
you accept permanent industry propped up

536
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,040
Italy and Constitution the proper

537
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,619
is to give up your engines in favor
arrived

538
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:23,810
little party is not now and never has
been

539
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,009
a balance between might properly

540
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,730
public comments comments is a whole
other loggers

541
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,280
it's not okay some polls it's not okay

542
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,640
for big kids to beach of but they don't
actually break with

543
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,900
it's wrong all the time and everywhere

544
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,049
to just quit fucking apologizing

545
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:49,660
proposed are fighting and being somebody
ask you the three words or for worse is

546
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,960
crossing point isn't to say

547
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,810
I don't believe it'll happen its long
thanks

548
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:02,810
its on going back to

549
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,390
economics people are motivated by
self-interest

550
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,700
and I see full-size debate

551
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,049
anglicized man but I think if we can
work on the way

552
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,470
so arguing like rights like rights

553
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,079
is trying to get to the bottom home and
we can compensate

554
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,880
these artists for their time and test
pilot self-interest

555
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,369
I think we'll find a way to mutually
work and

556
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:36,839
30 the this prevail p as well as locals

557
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,578
on I think that on me think that's a
that's a

558
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:43,910
for that everybody agrees with that no
real or

559
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,109
ours okay it's really important but
getting orders

560
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:51,770
K my point here on this and guitarist
nasal

561
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,460
princes that anything we have been doing
that we could arrange did you get the

562
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:56,930
artist

563
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,640
a with on alas

564
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,368
on in May major nasdaq stage lines

565
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:08,490
it is said if we exist

566
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,030
at Lucky industry has to destroy us

567
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,829
has the story of this to destroy us will
that's what it's doing

568
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:22,829
we can help allies because they want

569
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,850
haha

570
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,370
well

571
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,850
you mention that

572
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,640
was all the time gotta minutes about 10
minutes more

573
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,890
it was worth just a clarification like
on

574
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,069
he said the as the Constitution
enshrines

575
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,210
the the street have I P it wasn't
reminders that

576
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,530
at least a hundred years after the
Constitution corporations

577
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,130
actually acquired the rights a people

578
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,040
a in the late 19th century that
corporations actually

579
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,570
were able to start whole copyrights
because they were considered important

580
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,910
people in very bad judge decision by the
Supreme Court

581
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,230
until that time the founding fathers
heading to the dismay much for

582
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,640
individuals to be the artist three years

583
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,879
and therefore the holders call right
beneficiaries

584
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,180
how do you think that that's where yes I
mean

585
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,730
the there are reports that there are
there agree with both

586
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,040
on the historical historia are

587
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,850
local property has always been under
censorship

588
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,270
its its store all routes around

589
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,950
censorship chrome I'll

590
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,200
and as far as without the corporations
didn't have

591
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,119
rightful property it away on its it's
the same thing we were so industries

592
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,150
star hotels on cell

593
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,890
a.m. even on the larger properties

594
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,440
passes for me these two graciously

595
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,280
permanent px kittens were pop

596
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,299
legal means

597
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:12,960
its

598
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,099
yeah yeah loading the seeds with their
network is lauded

599
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:23,089
to or I like the idea of fun

600
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:27,930
parties and like 7s I think that is a
great deal says it is very good to hear

601
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,910
people instead of just being either

602
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,410
practical solutions I think you know if
you see it was any

603
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,740
get something in the evening again
immediately if we continue

604
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,040
taxes like that does it actually bring
recording industry all the way down if

605
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,880
it doesnt mean im going im sry only down

606
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,339
what kinda meditations when finished
with a warning industry have the correct

607
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:47,000
those

608
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,780
and then I mean like you ultimately if
this does work as always for

609
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,819
like problem with socialism communism to
its like honey

610
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:57,910
ADRs you know like in in you know the
Grahams

611
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,690
on ideal analysis Angeles so

612
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,650
one outlet next as well as councils into
suggested

613
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,109
well on you

614
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:12,480
for quotations that saw

615
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,329
I thought about it I don't know what the
a lot following their side

616
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:20,859
I know what yes with file back in this
isn't right

617
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:24,308
the other probably would be pretty on

618
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:28,280
at home to suppress that reportedly

619
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,420
kill for on this list

620
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,460
as many artists again on let me say

621
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,190
that on there are many ways to pay the
artists many many ways

622
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,980
its on and we

623
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,819
there there's a lot of problems with all

624
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,230
one of mir's the journalists is justly
clever

625
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,700
means realists I or maybe a little bar
stars

626
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,410
as as hackers this like he does I

627
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,649
down and that's the problem

628
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,790
first is the issue miller's government
policy

629
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:09,290
your social Barcelona listen

630
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,740
socialize your sensationalizes
considered

631
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,610
gun on to some there's no better wages

682
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,370
its books but it does require
substantial

683
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,640
research that so

684
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,770
my gas is issue

685
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:44,130
going to world outside hearts

686
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,180
spores for GTS throw

687
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,310
although the 2nd US military said you
think you gonna write for a living

688
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,580
with her a not only

689
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:59,370
like a the trial is really hard who
hears a writer that isn't

690
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,880
totally miserable called gone

691
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,490
you it is the worse th

692
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:10,830
take 80s and I killed you

693
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,290
all yeah this review just

694
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,430
that is babysit miss

695
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,049
music this there's there's a there's a
really good

696
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,720
of consciousness other specific or but
that's not my point

697
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,910
my point is that the star of the
Constitution

698
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,279
is not about

699
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,630
the Arts paying the artists it's about

700
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,060
guarantee need assistance specific
industry for all time

701
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,690
that happens also as a proxy by

702
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,420
the government to administer our loss by

703
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:51,060
that's a problem as a few know if you do
one thing to accomplish nothing

704
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,070
doesn't work go the clone look of

705
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,160
I stars backfired doesn't work

706
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,100
last less that's what I double

707
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,730
it is it they had to get rid of
intellectual property let you know

708
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:09,630
yet the writers were making nothing or
even last no that's terrible

709
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,330
absolutely on right no was

710
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,200
will obviously John's

711
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,710
me they didn't these important because

712
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,540
for dance I'll but when you bringin

713
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,070
that DMCA

714
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,650
much

715
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:31,000
and you JMT ships that

716
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,550
are just about for and music you get its

717
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,469
what I think

718
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:42,460
diane burns really insidious

719
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,210
its is providing researchers from

720
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:52,119
you know test pension schemes and door
survived

721
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,529
where Williams went scientific
development threes

722
00:46:56,529 --> 00:47:00,609

is getting

723
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,610
use source somebody

724
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,520

725
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,349
bad butts

726
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:12,930
ottomans other important parts these bad
laws

727
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,729
it really hurts us to have the people
saying

728

732
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:34,920

733
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,849

nobody respects

735
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:45,390

you're gonna cross me

736
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:49,118
you know in congress do they care that
Cory Doctorow

737
