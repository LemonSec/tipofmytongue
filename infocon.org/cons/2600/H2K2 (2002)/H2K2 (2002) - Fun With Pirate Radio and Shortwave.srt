12
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,590
one way or the other is the last thirty
years

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,750
and it started with me it back in the
nineteen sixties

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:56,750
when I was about 15 years old and I so
love program on ABC television affecting

Wallace

19
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,619
I grew up with was a lot bigger than
this this is what we're talking about

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,350
today

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,450
this is a Radio Shack the X 396

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,509
a.m. SM short way receive

23
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,799
so the program is right here

24
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,130
but anyway %uh back when I was a little

25
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,729
yellow younger lead so this program on
NBC television about

26
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,570
the golden days a great documentary is a
block away

27
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,960
was in the sixties 1tb and

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,500
they were talking about how radio came
into the law is

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,890
is the holes people all across this
great land

30
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,979
and hell this

31
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,159
but late twenties and thirties there
wasn't any television

32
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,159
little bit experimentally but not on
television broadcast

33
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,040
as we know certainly no computers and
phone lines well a strong but it was

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,560
pretty expensive to make a long distance
call

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,870
in those so people had real brought it
to their homes

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,099
fireside chats by FDR the show

37
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,569
you know miss CVS mystery theater all
the different stuff

38
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,480
the head so office during the day news
reports

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,859
people would come home after a hard
day's work crowd around the radio and

40
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,810
needless said

41
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,120
and they use their mind to paint
pictures

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,340
sociology and I saw this

43
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,599
and I said she I what

44
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,599
one of these grades really do and I said
my head it's how I go about doing this

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,099
cellulose as a

46
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,840
nonetheless I told my mother about it
and she said well

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,220
why don't you write a letter to the
federal government

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,790
and ask them how you can get your own
radio station

49
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,280
I'll some also

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,650
that and

51
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,459
so I'll probably that and I got this
nice little four-letter

52
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,180
backs you know informing me that radio
stations especially

53
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,080
because I live in Yonkers New York to of
course

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
millions and millions of dollars to bill
and

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,760
that we suggest that you get it ham
radio

56
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,250
if you have any interest in raid so I
said to myself

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,700
this will not do I want brought his

58
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,790
I mean a lot of my friends and school
were kinda a

59
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,220
especially old rates were and Apple
around Camry

60
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,030
and stuff like that which is great fast
but i wanna protest I want every one of

61
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,099
these people that

62
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,040
access to the airwaves got on the air of
people

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,220
play music maybe had inspired

64
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,359
this is so I think about you is so

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,860

77
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,820
mister natural which is on the top page

78
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,560
school

79
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,570
Arlington High School I was going to
saying that you know

80
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,599
a new radio station is gonna take to the

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,090
and sure enough I think it was October
22nd

82
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,240
1968 1960 went on here

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,570
and we broadcasted

84
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,759
on billing records music I had came out
of my father's a

85
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,169
record collection he had a combination
but shot shot music itself

86
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,770
beethoven stuff so the the first musical
selections

87
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,580
not the greatest thing but we were not
we operate for about three days

88
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,810
about it an hour each afternoon as I get
home from school at 3:30

89
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,320
we go on the air 4 and weed out late so
far are usually by five o'clock my

90
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,840
mother was hanging around the kitchen
begin to prepare suffers I think it'll

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,729
be a cool time ago of the year

92
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,150
because you know when you wanna higher
radio station you gotta kinda faded into

93
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,850
your life

94
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:51,360
its at the time so we operate for about
three or four days in all over you know

95
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,870
was listening to listen all up

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,259

it up all over the

97
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,250
southern part is on youngest New York
why even so the teachers and the

98
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,120
principal

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,889
high school was listening say they
should be arrested what they're doing

100
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,979
by actually what happened this

101
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,430
three days %uh there was a not not not

102
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,759
front door the house and i remember i
wont database

103
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,740
is basing his own hedges walked around
of the

104
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,800
the driveway looked with front door the
house was

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,020
just like in the movies I see to God's

106
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,859
with to our cats and black trench coats

107
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,190
standing see its

108
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,310
so quickly run back to the base couple
of my friends

109
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,840
we were doing program together I said
the SEC is here

110
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,389
and Avon slight it's likely that just
just like in a cartoon they were like

111
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,539
out the back door I ran out the back
door

112
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,900
and I and I went over to my friends
house I stayed here for a couple hours

113
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,740
and then I came back and my mother who
ran interference

114
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,220
actually she's pretty cool she said well
they all went downstairs need to listen

115
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,500
to the radio transmitters

116
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,180
and done the hilly you know they they
want to see this letter that what you're

117
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,810
doing is against the law

118
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,880
a local historical issued by the house
you know at all you know

119
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,870
certain some some some TN K and stuff
like that

120
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,090
they said well you know you're your son
is a very intelligent person but what

121
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,870
he's doing is

122
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,960
is definitely is slowly can't do that
anymore

123
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,169
and that is it so I I got a hole in my
father said well so

124
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:36,030
you know I'll looks like you really
can't do this I hate

125
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,720
think a lot of people like people

126
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,410
told so can do this yeah

127
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,900
so early to say remove some

128
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,479
to transmitter that cuts and cable
though the transmitter

129
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,539
I'll and I guess within an hour to I
passed everything back together

130
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:59,960
I know they took the Treasury 220 they
said although the following the 08 07 08

131
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,580
case it is always weird

132
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,289
all transferred into because it was a
military surplus transferred from World

133
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:06,889
War two

134
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,819
so I remember that me and my friends and
I went down to Canal Street area here in

135
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:13,889
New York City which is a great place to
get stuff

136
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,340
and picked up a set to five boxes
something like that

137
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,310
that stuff sure enough months later we
will rock and roll again so speaking all

138
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,449
this %uh

139
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,669
going through the multiple radio station
we had to be

140
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,859
went to FN every again II made

141
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,330
couple other people we set up the
station in North yonkers is

142
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,740
station south field office we
exclusively operated on 16:20 a.m.

143
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,890
and a 7.9 ed which i think some people
hire

144
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,830
New York City area still has a dark band
between the

145
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,970
or a carrier channel 6's be getting yes

146
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,459
yes so we did that for quite a while

147
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,870
all through through the years 1971

148
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,390
we actually had 30 to 40 people

149
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,010
%uh working at the station all my
friends in high school all kids in the

150
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,670
area

151
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,170
and you know it was really cool because

152
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,870
we were doing stuff creatively

153
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,550
with the pirate stations or the free
radio stations cool

154
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:25,080
we were probably 10 very the while the
very first day since 1970 1971

155
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,360
that began detail i phone calls
over-the-air

156
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,360
without delay and we would invite people
to get access to radio New York area

157
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,040
by calling us I'll and we were just
patched

158
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,300
directly using crews phone patches times
you know the phones

159
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,089
telephones back in the sixties and
seventies scenes

160
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,250
nobody could touch the falls we fade
away

161
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,880
taxes phone lines a little years

162
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,380
and I'll we of course we're playing all

163
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,100
latest rock and roll music which was

164
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,310
exploding in diversity in the late
sixties

165
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,260
this is still is you know this is kinda
special

166
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,110
and we were really really happened a lot
of helpful

167
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,160
and I think a contributing to the radio

168
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,000
are in itself you making an absolute

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,220
well hopefully a positive contribution
getting a lot of people in the area

170
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,850
political

171
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,430
programs for since the war in Vietnam
that time

172
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,430
no one talk page in history here but it
was this is more vietnam a lot of people

173
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,329
were very upset

174
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,070
and all my friends in high school
buddies were set you know

175
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,649
that who had accessed radio is no access

176
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,350
radios stereo much controlled by session
in New York area

177
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,459
by major family concerns in business

178
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,500
so that it goes unheard for anybody
getting Airtel

179
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,010
toothbrushes anything that would rock
Bowl status quo

180
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,410
was there was some commercial

181
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,600
pro-civil so

182
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,240
we ran the station until August 1971

183
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,370
we were probably busted and busted good

184
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,519
%uh they came in with tractor-trailers
and federal agents

185
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,990
and they showed are stationed down
august twelfth 1971

186
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,990
they arrested myself my partner

187
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,890
other was down to Foley Square through
the city jail cell

188
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,420
and only with a chance Smith

189
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,729
remember this in the cell

190
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,450
this mother rachel is father rate

191
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,550
all kinds of weird people in Excel

192
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,990
they come up to us and they say I

193
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,510
worrying for running a radio station

194
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,670
with this words but

195
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,649
you know any we r we got outta your way

196
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,360
we were charged with several counts
violated

197
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,639
Broadcasting Act the Telecommunications
Act 1934 which

198
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,339
base States I those people the house a
lot transmitted without a license

199
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,180
we were not fun because they think
you're doing it they do that a lot

200
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,279
I'll and we will release our own
recognizance

201
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,189
I'll we had the requisite representation

202
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,010
we got off with about one year probation
and they did

203
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,180
conversely formal

204
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,300
and they were there was a lot of sweet
had a lot of a

205
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,730
disinterested in here we we are also
experimenting with television

206
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,010
before the finally lower the bill

207
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,189
we were putting some signals on channel
six in the New York City area

208
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,480
definitely getting a lot of people
assert that

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,750
but and television pull back then really
expensive me

210
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,450
TV cameras hundreds of thousands of
dollars

211
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,990
up but we were playing around with old
surveillance cams

212
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,160
Douglas earth selfless

213
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,610
world war two televisions is it is
designed

214
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,649
the availability of equipment to do free
radio

215
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:13,959
nano is of thousands of lives fall

216
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,889
then what was available that sexists

217
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,930
so the moral of the story is on

218
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,230
we did we got busted and then I got into
more

219
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,100
which is like radio but I still hired

220
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,660
and my last official pirate radio
station

221
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,630
was shut down in nineteen he to

222
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,630
and I and II who had moved to me

223
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,010
up in northern Maine but I Bild AM a

224
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,279
radio station up there used 400 for
towers legal station but at night

225
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,689
we would take forever for telling feet
1620

226
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,769
I'll a.m. into it propagate all he
scores the United States

227
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,899
and finally SEC kinda it really bothers

228
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,019
the kinda got to do with so we shut down

229
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:06,310
now is it that was the last pirate

230
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,949
radio I are I Detroit

231
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,519
cover radio in New York City area

232
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,100
because I always wanted to put a
high-powered

233
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,639
legal free station in the New York City
area

234
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,279
and back in 1987 I partnership

235
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,910
off the coast of Long Island New York
and went on the air

236
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,560
with the 5000 Watts 1620 and

237
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,860
1000 Watts 10 3.1

238
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,870
and that lasted a total of about four
days was the three or four days

239
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,339
Haji saying and

240
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,620
well they came out with more than the
SEC nation is there

241
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,889
but the I don't miss it hired station I
can see that perfectly legal as we were

242
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:58,320
outside three mile territorial limit

243
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,500
so now on fast-forwarding going through
other miscellaneous commercial stations

244
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,310
that i've been involved with

245
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,750
so now about about four years ago

246
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,970
I said I'll thank you for you

247
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,160
love it yeah all

248
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,310
so we operate yeah unfortunately to say
she didn't last very long but it

249
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,009
definitely made a lot of ways

250
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:25,699
fast-forwarding to what's happening now

251
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:29,470
is there's a different kinda radio
that's available

252
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,079
and pirate radio now

253
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,350
is now spending a lot of time on
something known sure

254
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,589
way how do you know what short-wave
radios

255
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,579
raise your hands up lastly to the
completely

256
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,180
you know and am

257
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,389
all necessary this is surely receive it
four years ago

258
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,949
after thirty years

259
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,970
up fighting with the Federal
Communications Commission they finally

260
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,470
granted a licence

261
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,540
to bill a fifty thousand lot sure

262
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,810
way station I'll on my property

263
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,120
in northern Maine same property that
we've hired at back in 1982

264
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,189
and I operate radio station along

265
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:17,719
10 on that's known as WBC

266
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,569
cue the plan and we went on the air

267
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,689
it shows

268
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:27,879
said yeah

269
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,769
this is a more past holeshot that that's
the entrances station or early May

270
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,879
is in the middle of nowhere lately with
trailer

271
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,970
complete with trailers and buses this
storage in all this stuff

272
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,189
yes it's your down-home Tobacco Road
radio station

273
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:48,480
but them we believe this station

274
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,750
as I said about four years ago 1998

275
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,860
and

276
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,290
a we operated as a as an

277
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,660
some people call WBC hugh

278
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,060
the country's first slices hired what we
do is

279
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,179
we we offer a retired anyone that wants
to get on the air like you

280
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,090
WDC the some other folks

281
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,709
off the hook right um and

282
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,810
we offer air time we have we have to
charge a nominal fee for it because

283
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,500
running a 50 kilowatt transfer is very
expensive that that's one of our

284
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,770
transmitters there

285
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,980
and we operate this station

286
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,990
and it has the philosophy of giving
people access to

287
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,930
the airwaves and giving them and an
opportunity

288
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,320
to get their message uncensored and

289
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,010
and you guys can attest to that I
uncensored

290
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,379
all over our are Airways no short wave

291
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,000
I believe is turning into this

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,560
kinda marvelous all underground medium

293
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,090
on as people throughout the world you're
getting more discontent with the 100 on

294
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,530
both

295
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,290
local AM and FM they're going out and
buying yeah

296
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,730
short-wave radios which is very
inexpensive I mean you can spend twenty

297
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,880
dollars alone you can spend two thousand
dollars on the go the whole

298
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,090
that this one was and a seventy busses

299
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,480
so and yet on this one oh yeah

300
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,080
sw1 I go sleep tonight also Affordable
Art

301
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,020
I would be fine with me I had one but it
all looks like dropped into the salt

302
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,240
water that was the end

303
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,299
yelling this is il-1

304
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:38,230
yeah this is this is a well the front
panel for a car radio that's only makes

305
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,150
which also picks up short wave

306
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,710
and boats so

307
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,260
you know there's lotsa lots of
opportunities to get short-wave radios

308
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,730
now that you know what's happening with
short-wave is

309
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,100
people throughout the country in the
world tuning into shortly

310
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,380
now to hear wild and wacky stuff

311
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,650
and WBC hugh mom

312
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,140
I'm proud to report definitely has a lot
of wild and wacky stuff on

313
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,620
takin a website WBC cue dotnet

314
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,090
in your spare time go to it

315
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,279
and you can download our complete
broadcast schedule

316
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,820
I can give you a tip the weekends is the
best unfortunately

317
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,730
commit well it's unfortunately the the
reality is to keep

318
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,200
on money coming into the coffers

319
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,529
we do sell time to which is organs old
Bible

320
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:34,630
leaders says we do we do sell time to
the bottom feeders

321
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:40,440
up but we do that because it costs a lot
of money to run the transmitters

322
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,760
able to operate the may L what one
transmitting to is a thousand dollars

323
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,940
to replace its big star but the
government requires

324
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,090
an international short way station have
a minimal output power 50,000 once a

325
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,370
week after here

326
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,750
to the SEC's rules even though we could
do the same

327
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,409
10 but it's the gold and

328
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,740
that's one of our transmitters they're
actually under construction as well it's

329
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,710
a little messy

330
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,799
and in their old photos

331
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,840
in finding new ones but anyway on

332
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,570
and you know so we do as I said we we
charge a nominal fee we get people on

333
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,750
here but it's actually a very
fascinating radio station and I believe

334
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,649
that even with the internet which is a
great resource in which we use now to

335
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:32,450
connect a lot of people %uh we just some
of our clients we just pick up

336
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,710
a couple of their website protest too
much away but the nice thing about short

337
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,490
wave is

338
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,659
and the nice thing about me is is that

339
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,980
its it's simple and to most people

340
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,169
it's so simple they can just pick up a
receipt

341
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,309
and I know that a lot I did you hear

342
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:56,030
love you folks here this morning
probably here because you're interested

343
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,649
including your old radio station here

344
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:03,030
I can say this I have this is you know
why

345
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,510
yes as a license protester I cannot
advocate

346
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,559
or encourage neru to build your own

347
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,480
pirate radio station buy the premade

348
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,480
okay I G I can't do that but I can
certainly understand

349
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:26,649
why you wouldn't want to because
unfortunately the government has not

350
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:30,200
even with the LPS and how many you know
about low-power

351
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,049
yeah even with all PSN they had it done

352
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,990
we all hoped they would do and that is
provide fans at frequencies with people

353
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,240
could literally put on

354
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,210
amateur broadcasting stations easily in
South

355
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,929
we just send in an application find a
frequency

356
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:51,080
which'll probably have to share with
lots of others go on here

357
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,740
LPFM distillers still you know is only a
certain numbers stations congress

358
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,399
definitely swells it back because
majorette and

359
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:05,450
protesters in his country was offering
there was actually something different

360
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,409
than

361
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,020
both done so many you're probably
thinking about this

362
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,799
what I have learned through the years is
people that engage in free radio

363
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:19,010
hire a radio or Rhys several things

364
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,260
if you put a station on the air %uh the
new tactic that the government does now

365
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,820
as they come in they arrest all here

366
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,189
with meaning if you set up a situation
like this on shortwave

367
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,260
using a converted him transmitter we
have any other stuff

368
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,158
the notice surely this high frequency
stuff on this

369
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,850
you know there are closes FM

370
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,159
transfers them by from all kinds of
companies one that comes to mind is

371
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,770
ramzi kits they sell their on the net

372
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,168
ramzi they sell Heinz's FM transmitters

373
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,929
people is a plug-and-play violence that
he had a building from scratch in the

374
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,780
back in the 60s sixties and seventies

375
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,639
today just said a way to get one but

376
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:07,889
you go on the air and generally will
give you a few mornings

377
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:11,649
you know they might knock on your door
they might the fine you

378
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:16,440
ten thousand dollars or something like
that but generally with new ones if you

379
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,230
don't stop

380
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,360
come in there and start trading your
equipment and Ray

381
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,179
things out yes a task in line for your
transmitter

382
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,610
your computer doctor transmitter run run
from the pic to

383
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,530
yeah well they'll go beyond that i mean
they are built a furniture

384
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:35,030
it depends on the st. they wanna be
they'll take furniture they'll clean

385
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,840
your house out because the sale of
everything he was used

386
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,879
in the commission of this crime oh
absolutely let's go

387
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,770
you know CDs goal now they don't do this
at all

388
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,950
I mean the SEC's like anybody knows look
you know like any

389
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,120
bureaucracy the always look for the easy
fast cheap way out

390
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,980
so generally give a couple warnings and
whatever but there have been some

391
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,030
you know pirate broadcasters that done
get on the air and

392
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,110
other they find and they lose and

393
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,300
and then they come in

394
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:11,160
a there a village by I can tell you this
is after all the years I've done radio

395
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,690
if you go to any kind of real may she
doing missions

396
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,630
if you wanna get only a religious play
music

397
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,280
basically radio mister B gonna

398
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,280
set up an internet radio station you
know yeah I know

399
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,870
I know that's that's that's a whole
different problem now which is

400
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,890
disgusting

401
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,980
that's the way it is a anytime anybody
develop something good fun

402
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,610
heroes people figure out how to make
money on

403
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,680
so if you can if you take a transmitter

404
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,910
and do something with it that is not you
know

405
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,600
the status quo however you wanna call
just be careful lectures for good reason

406
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,640
anytime that we would do higher radio

407
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,640
%uh we did because there was a reason
you know whether it was

408
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,290
allowing people to get access have free
expression

409
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,120
to here expressing political dissent

410
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,390
in fact the I don't think there are any
clandestine radio

411
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,930
you know clandestine stations you know
it was politically motivated

412
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,220
motivated stations currently operating
country there had been

413
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,280
work done those are you gonna do it

414
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,450
which I can't encourage you to do but if
you couldn't do it

415
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,090
make sure this worked on good reason he
just want to get on the airplane using

416
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,080
whatever

417
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,970
listens yourself and you know that there
are risks involved because they also

418
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,800
fun they also will find you and the
fines are usually have to use you try to

419
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,970
give you a whopping fine like they'll
start out with twenty thousand dollars

420
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,730
in annual

421
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,200
notice in all look right and maybe a
little reduces

422
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,710
5 deliver %uh and a lot of people I know

423
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,010
that have gotten day and hopefully find
love

424
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,800
never really paid the fine but it's
still nd still in action

425
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,720
got a deal so you free radio make sure
it's for a good reason because the end

426
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,160
and as I can advocate because my
position

427
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,830
but I do understand why it happens their
communities there

428
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,060
group of people that while access

429
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,270
to radio in a community or see

430
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,700
and adjust on the channel's left images
no way

431
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,460
then do it and they get frustrated and
they go on the air

432
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,260
I i understand that because I was one of
those people

433
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,600
on we do WBC hugh

434
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,320
has a a time and we make it available at
special rates

435
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,460
for people that are trying to do free
radiance

436
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,630
really different so if any of you out
there are

437
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,910
actually it was thinking really do is
radio broadcasting

438
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,020
wanna get on the short wave is covers

439
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,620
times all the world you know we've the
mars signal at a northern made using

440
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,500
this star

441
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,040
but I think there's a picture or yeah
it's one of our intent is

442
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,750
over are it's a it kinda looks like a
gigantic TV antenna that the elements

443
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,190
like sixty feet long

444
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,510
you know it's better we being out till

445
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,240
using in 10 days like this at a northern
maybe meeting that we we we being

446
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,300
towards mexico but obviously the united
states in the way

447
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,520
so we cover we cover a lot of the US

448
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,950
we get into Europe we get your signal
out so

449
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,820
if you want more information on us the
WBC cue the

450
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,830
we also have decided WBC to dot com

451
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,610
are that's we we have an audio stream
therefore our main service on 741 fights

the WBC cued up that

453
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,460
WBC cue that com I don't forget complex
variables

454
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,130
right well we have lots of photographs
complex variables

455
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,920
studio dot com 11 right now don't like
that the whole morning world like this

456
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,780
is all a work

457
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,160
complex variables studio dot com that
will %uh

458
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,960

electricity in obviously

462
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,379
we have to hire you know I have people
that help us gotta pay them

463
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,470
some to operate the equipment arm

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,600
and we'll get you on the above

465
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,840
but I do encourage everyone out there
too invests

shortwave radio and radar frequency down
7415

467
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,240
my dear friend because that's where we
operate on the short way

468
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,090
that's our main frequency: our main
frequency at me

469
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,670
is 7.4 15 megahertz

470
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,000
and a good time to listen is on

471

does it all I hear you farm by censors
you meet people

478
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,890
it's a felony which the workers on
amateur radio I was told that

479
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,280
using selling over the airwaves are well
we

480
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,629
we had programmers Melissa right here
that

481
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,740
use four-letter words are the BBC's you
i mean obviously only encourage it but

482
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,170
we do not tell people

483
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,860
that they can't say is can say that we

484
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,190
we tell them to use good judgment

485
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:02,180
in you know whatever they do but we do
have programmers that play music

486
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,850
and comedy bits that had some the

487
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,960
you know George Carlin seven dirty words
and idaho

488
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,980
i'd of are

489
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,950
me they have yeah

490
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,090
well the government can come in anytime
and cleary us

491
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:27,410
on whatever we program but the actually
in all honesty in the SEC

492
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,040
dominate you might find this hard to
believe the SEC

493
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,770
has actually been very good to our
station

494
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,750
arm they had cut us a lot of leeway

495
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,910
because they know who we are from RKS

496
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,390
and

497
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,650
and they have not ever ever bother us

498
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,350
for any our programming content because
they don't like to get into that this is

499
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,540
something call

500
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,460
the first amendment and WBC he was a
member station

501
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,870
for us the first love radio transmitter
in society

502
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,450
when we are also the station that is
dedicated to

503
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,710
free speech that is what we do

504
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,690
yes our

505
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,470
since his earnings does the Constitution
at large reason point

506
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,270
the federal communications at quotes

507
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,700
its stores the his cameras

508
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,980
was you know this is customs correct I
believe that follow the basis for

509
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,200
yes numbers is the practice exchange

510
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,890
purposes game so advertising products

511
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,600
yesterday allies finances

512
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,750
the SEC Wednesday's

513
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,340
and other activities was today trade

514
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,500
the trade by

515
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,720
yes because

516
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,770
listen i i huge argument isn't it
actually goes beyond that because a lot

517
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,430
of people there

518
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,220
pirated have actually said well if our
signal does not go over to stay

519
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:10,220
boundaries that why does the SEC have
jurisdiction the

520
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,400
the federal government under access
congress claims

521
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,910
authority over anything transmitted from

522
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,070
from its shores and into

523
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,270
Beach Shores John guy play Missouri to
hear

524
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,500
guns Brightwell this is I hear what you
sayin your

525
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,070
your argument is arguments that we have
used in core

526
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,780
but the courts do not recognize it they

527
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,139
really look at the SEC is the ultimate
licensing authority

528
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,620
and if the SEC comes out and says

529
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,080
we are gonna start licensee be easily

530
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,090
like coming out of the spotlight
projectors

531
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,220
it can happen I don't know

532
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,370
how the action would be framed but there
are

533
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,000
at his lawyers that well word refer to
as

534
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,330
this in action re: 88 fishbowl will

535
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,720
war until the SEC should be yes

536
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,330
in North in a hearing to show

537
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,560
their authority and was nations they

538
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,300
by the way say they've been challenged
and unfortunately

539
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,900
other people that obviously radio
stations have challenged them

540
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,880
on similar to the issues that you bring
up

541
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,590
the course on C they just don't see keep
it up

542
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,050
the US District Courts for the readings
days

543
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,300
limited jurisdiction I bush

544
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,140
they had yes here any cases at all

545
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,570
involving citizen status when the data
MC gathers

546
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,409
they don't get this here ninety-five
percent cases they

547
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,690
pretending here I'll good

548
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,890
all before we taking your questions a my

549
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:03,300
brother in arms here Tim Smith 10 Tron
has been involved in radio

550
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,740
and in ham radio for years and years and
years and I'm sure

551
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,530
that you have to look different take
yeah I'm sure you have something to a

552
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,830
total I do

553
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:19,620
so please by all well take the

554
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,418
mobile falling polling book she owns

555
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:29,629
pirate efforts well all flamboyant lot
further ahead than mine never got well

556
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,330
big differences is he was busted

557
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,989
I have a while so certain facts I'm
going to have to withhold

558
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:43,640
but it all started back many many many
years ago I was just

559
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,009
a little over I love to listen to the
radio I love to listen to rock and roll

560
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,330
music which was back in the fifties

561
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,639
but it was all be getting it will fall
and follow

562
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,279
radio fascinated me know and after a
while

563
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,640
I started beginning to wonder hola
sustained work

564
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,730
them one day when I was about a mile and
a half years old one dad brought home a

565
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,980
popular radio amateurs hanbo

566
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,960
and I'm part through that thing and I
saw last instruction articles on

567
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,870
building receivers bowling transmitters
and I didn't think you know or

568
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,920
understand what

569
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,480
really was going on but I had on when I
was about 12 years old I started

570
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,250
building my first 22

571
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,540
AM radios those June well

572
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,150
rock and roll music on and I was
teaching music on something

573
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,250
so I built but after a while I was
saying

574
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,980
what is it to a transmitter and she had
lost the solo home wireless

575
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,180
follow selena is basically a little 12
transmitter where you take the offer

576
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,129
your pornographic jacket and

577
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,190
and listen to it through the radio a
very rudimentary transmitter

578
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,170
best but I E begin to figure out that
there's a lot more to

579
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,990
transmitter that just 112 lber then one
time

580
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,390
why won't the summer camp I attended an
electronics

581
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,900
kinda class or activity or whatever you
want to call the most popular thing

582
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,950
where these launches transmitters made
by this probably known as like shit

583
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,759
there was a real transmitter it had a
we'll also later

584
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,050
real modulator a real speech input

585
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,200
section if you will well they cost
twelve dollars and ninety five cents in

586
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,580
1962 when I

587
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,750
big he did with my mother for money
russians tucci

588
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,940
but I've got one under the Christmas
tree and I

589
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,370
sure the whole thing together all set up

590
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,970
ready to rock and roll out a hundred
feel why rock as an antenna

591
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,130
I hold on to what and needless to say
the range was

592
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:52,270
said I kept wondering how I'm going to
improve this thing

593
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,920
how are you going to make it better and
I lay in bed at night

594
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,340
thinking about those 22 radios like bill

595
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,530
how one stage was an RF amplifier that
signal from the Intel

596
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,860
ample quiet said to a detector and I
said

597
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,770
hmm maybe I can turn this thing around
ass backwards

598
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,340
make and ample fire for transmitter

599
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,420
well I had quite a star parts

600
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,390
back down parts were half from old TV
sets a friend of mine and I would get up

601
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,819
every Saturday morning and pedal our
asses down the local TomTom

602
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,160
stir parts of the whole TV sets
transformers

603
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,310
tombs capacitors resistors on on it

604
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,049
nauseam sites altogether an amplifier
using what was known as a

605
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:43,280
for solace sweet to output the horse all
sweet section of the TV set

606
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,390
ball the most amount of power in the
shower so obviously the two men fall

607
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,810
was largest forget about today's TV sets

608
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,509
the transistors that they use just are
are unsuitable

609
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,410
for broadcast we're side of the little
amplifier

610
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,720
it sure worked yeah fight it all the
rage

611
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,360
but things like two inserts I did not
understand that one day

612
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,150
dawn broke over Marblehead and I chichi
other

613
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,730
a transmitter that probably delivered
about 25 wats of which I'd still have

614
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,800
desert lush AP but I still have the
thing

615
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,310
and I'll all the thing which is a term
use

616
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,529
to impossible under the antenna and I
call a buddy of mine up

617
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,520
lose about eight miles away and he
started twenty right now I

618
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,750
Chevron station down around 800 on the
dial just a bit above WABC

619
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,570
and he's touring around here in the
stopper the background were all

620
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,850
citizens like Wow monsoons get

621
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,339
mammals call so after school every day

622
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,910
I was on the year but basically I
thought the stretch more for frontline's

623
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,700
a birthday present so after about three
weeks

624
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,610
he got his presence but in the meantime
my mother was full of questions

625
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,100
so she wrote a letter to the feces
better known as the FCC

626
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,210
and then responded back with a little

627
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,470
camp for title does my transmitter need
a license

628
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,410
well after that point I i'm kind of
operating a clandestine

629
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,250
matter when it came to doing pirate
radio by other transmitters I got up did

630
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,020
not point he

631
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,910
or what I hate bill given to my friend
but the Saints for amateur radio always

632
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,660
interested me to hobnob with other
people ever in the rolling

633
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,910
their own transmitters together and just
using them to communicate have a good

634
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,870
time with

635
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,680
and I started listening around only all
hella crafter shortwave radio that was

636
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,160
given to me as a Christmas present that
my mother follow the neighbor's trash

637
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,100
him

638
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,440
with great interest to the ham radio
people on a.m. on 75 meters

639
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,650
that any time I started thinking about
all

640
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,400
well I really want to get the ham radio
but the Morse hole was a huge stumbling

641
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,280
block

642
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,260
so I thought on as what was known as 0
like you or just simply

643
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,150
up boot well a few months later

644
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:15,200
I eventually saw I'll learning Morse
code which idea and I finally went

645
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,400
through the upgrades and all that kind
of thing but my first nation

646
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,640
for music and broadcasting and
entertainment

647
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,660
never left me well back in the ER only
shows

648
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,899
he is she just backing things up a bit

649
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,260
most my operations always been on
amplitude modulation most people operate

650
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,680
site

651
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,299
I don't care for site member to delete I
don't care for the audio quality granite

652
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,400
is more spectrum

653
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,590
vision and it gets better as far as

654
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,590
bang for the buck but in terms of of the
dalai its simplicity for

655
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:52,359
get don't even waste your time with it
yeah I understand a lot of today's

656
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:55,540
shortwave pirates are using it Hall

657
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,290
for out %ah

658
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,500
stars all door latch

659
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,800
turn off but anyway

660
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,940
I started listening wrong on other bands
either side amateur bands such as the

661
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,359
International shortwave bands in just
over 49 meter band

662
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:18,799
and the daytime was virtually vacant
except for a few Canadians

663
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,250
on one single on ham radio strictly
verboten to play music

664
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,770
yet my friends of mine and I will get on
and drop tombs occasionally to test our

665
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,990
translators who would get all the whole
buzzards all in

666
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:35,230
all rage in over or what not

667
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,430
did should be checked for play music
wrong here

668
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,049
start thinking about forty nine meters
consider myself

669
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,420
now she was a chopper spectrum is not
being used during the daytime

670
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,840
widely making sure that solo it's no big
thing

671
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,280
to move in and Richard transmitter all
the amateur bands

672
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,910
I had a bunch of crystals on the six
megahertz range in mostar

673
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,910
passion about my body's and before you
know what

674
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,410
we're all up on 49 meters every Saturday
morning

675
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,910
after partying from the night before
Sunday

676
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,660
and we just stay tuned back and forth
back and forth no I'm

677
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,270
deeds that one other gods got all air
and open up the microphone Human

678
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,200
Services WTK says

679
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,290
Florida well there's a little
publication owners

680
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,120
about it wasn't the H those another
publication

681
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,500
and they're all these %uh loggins

682
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,390
for these unidentified music stations on
forty nine meters

683
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,310
and the only clue they gave was station
calling itself

684
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:42,100
WTK seasons Florida and then after a
while I said

685
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:47,050
him this is possibilities well

686
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:51,190
the little while later i holed up in
chief engineer

687
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,760
of a little a.m. day-timer this whole
the slow

688
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,070
and I haven't harder on this console
which had a little mention border two

689
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,210
turntables all the time to do the
remotes

690
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,780
that they did quite a few about 30 times
when we weren't using it might bring

691
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,380
nothing in my way up

692
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,000
him station which was a whole building
on occupied

693
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,170
and I would have these parties on the
dollar sitcom of the week

694
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,870
really get traction I take my chill of
AM transmitter

695
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:23,380
fire it up on 1580 and put gold WX NC is
it was known as on the air from time to

696
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,260
time

697
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,850
but the whole time it was a great

698
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,520
all day small following air eaves

699
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,240
nice warm day almost drug especially
back then

700
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,970
saw you to master the art of feeling
good

701
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:44,160
and a friend of mine was living next
door and red pottage

702
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,149
we drank the board over shut up and they
want to give each

703
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:53,910
I ran back bread the tape deck gravel
pilot records grab this crap that

704
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:58,720
and then I decided it was full on sure
your typical shortwave broadcast station

705
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,020
now

706
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:03,340
give it to you cross you least back then
mostly political bullshit

707
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,450
and the Bible beaters what time is it

708
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:12,390
okay are well I'm just on going up
quickly fast for

709
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,799
real change from worldwide was born but
because my voice

710
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,490
was so recognizable I only broadcast for
the once or twice

711
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,420
and then I quit and then I'm signing up
with a body in mind with different radio

712
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,470
entity

713
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,359
which was more was produced and put
together but you may ask

714
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,650
why was I never Boston

715
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,720
you see most pirates to cling to a
frequency

716
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,900
only operate their they evolve their
phone number they give out their address

717
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,100
me my voice was not used on for one
thing for nothing

718
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,810
I always want from frequency the
frequency the frequency with him

719
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:54,930
bans designated for broadcasting do not
operate outside

720
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,720
obey because that's what people start
beginning to wonder why is a station

721
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,910
playing music

722
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,470
in an area where it's not supposed to be
and then

723
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:10,140
the other people are who like having
their station heard saying well

724
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,279
if you're in an area where all the
others are how are you going to be fun

725
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,839
but on a roll one of the other guys
involve the whole thing

726
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,920
managed to get a mail drop which was
used by a lot of pirates

727
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,950
it was widely publicized pokémon

728
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,339
animal letters started pouring here so
you're sure the circle into the air were

729
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:35,190
plans I know not where by nineteen
eighty-seven frontal eye and a lot of

730
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,140
the

731
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,430
I wouldn't say that programming by a he
was the

732
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:44,279
the basically the announcer he and I
came to a vast disagreement

733
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,560
is to how the thing was to be programmed
in which direction was going

734
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,060
at that time I was chief engineer on
am/fm home all

735
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,420
and why would dole is I'd make you so
the record library

736
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,950
a production studio was some local
broadcasts

737
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,050
by I was in 1987 I'm home I tons of them

738
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:06,140
law that's the way it's been love
finally

739
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,549
fold up with our but at that particular
point I'm I also moved the main as well

740
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,339
on being on stove I Alan in his
escapades

741
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:18,070
but the other thing is is I luv I lose
all country

742
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,920
there are no neighbors at least there
were no neighbors this tax thing

743
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,320
they'll really were one any server free
radio operation our neighbors

744
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,650
where you are a single was getting
another toaster is getting into their

745
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,240
hearing aid is getting into this

746
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,470
it's getting into his wife's vibrator
and

747
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:39,100
data dole want to hear this day so late

748
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,530
call off welfare Orleans saw

749
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,920
that's just some advice from me

750
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,890
arm from where things are going now

751
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:55,230
and being at the SEC's resources or more
more limited

752
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:01,100
that parents alike annoying flies that
buzz around goes around and annoy them

753
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,570
but then again when we come slap your
from what I've been hearing

754
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:08,790
it is bad news I always leave it at that

755
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:15,790
okay GoPro okay

756
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,370
I have a Canadian and I all spots are I

757
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,020
tractor-trailer I operate a sure way
fire station

758
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:27,970
from major as a relay station for other
stations

759
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,450
they'll they'll mail tapes or CDs to be
and by air them

760
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:36,420
from drug with a lot sometimes doesn't

761
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,230
a naval officers will use is

762
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,170
that one which isn't too modified it a
radio transmitter the date you must

763
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,470
modify it

764
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,819
to broadcast for want to others to
diagnose

765
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:56,350
stable of and

766
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:00,120
the Jezreel brokers with the AM
broadcast band it's a long way

767
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,640
want a play around with long way just
have fun to do

768
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,240
for home use as a whole set up here on

00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,890
what transpired other examples years ago
surely

846
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,359
power gathering problems

847
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,770
North Philadelphia that the box

848
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:11,279

by to listeners each about 500 miles
away

851
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:22,799
in different directions and it sounds
pretty amazing

852
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,880
10 watching range that was possible
shortwave

853

atrocities for broadcasting

859
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,879

%uh you're going over some things
censorship here

864
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:16,339
mom aside from the fact that

865
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:19,470
you know anyway she broke a sweat

866
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,819
online are way time

867
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:26,859
same here fun as far as commercial
license

868
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:30,850
stations they are safe harbor and
feature yesterday

869
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,100
basically they had this post fearing

870
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,110
or Terry a loved one

871
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,330
state hitler's social radio stations

872
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:45,920
take advantage this year the committee
the SEC is actually

873
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,860
hammered commercial stations bonds for

874
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,870
really get on the excretory functions

875
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,370
things like that derogatory way you
someone you don't like

876
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:01,759
sure things will do one other reasons
why

877
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,880
we we own sense of programs

878
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,700
you is because hearing internationals

879
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,900
me is somebody the United States

880
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,150
listens WBC you Inc also

881
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:19,000
the SEC says well I heard a pro this

882
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,220
show WDC the using all homes

883
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,270
follow words including the F word in the
C word

884
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,440
everything else once what are you going
to do about

885
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,820
well they will reply are

886
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,110
its international broadcasting station
and

887
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:38,320
generally do not get ball program

888
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,490
world stage government

889
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:45,040
are surely is has taken a stance

890
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,750
we're you the domestic Lee in this
country

891
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,980
a lot on body

892
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,120
play say girl or something

893
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,819
other country the that his ashes

894
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,380
state orange BR to find

895
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,730
further focus on your thing are a lot
stations

896
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,840
this country's largest scared the

897
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,550
far for PST

898
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:17,520
material as a lot of questionable Angie

899
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,130
they just they just of blood glucose
they don't want the hassle

900
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,200
palm example is a yes

901
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,270
well 'cause bro cases like howard stern
you know

902
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,220
do it

903
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,660
the SEC is fine arm is

904
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,930
radio company numerous times they just
pay the fine

905
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,970
%uh as they've got a million so the
hundreds of thousands of dollars

906
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:43,960
do it so it really is up to the station
I think what you gonna find is in the

907
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,760
next five to 10 years a lot more
broadcasters stations in the United

908
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,440
States probably lose a little bit more

909
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,770
because be you know ever since the 9/11
are you seeing documentaries

910
00:56:55,770 --> 00:57:00,020
programs that actual ordeals lives of
people doing stuff

911
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,599
and they're using all has a four letter
words

912
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:09,340
i think i think is change WBC hugh as I
said we don't sense of old

913
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,420
programs get on studies the four-letter
words sometimes

914
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,760
there are few eyebrows in a few hey I
hope you know what you doing

915
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,330
but generally we find people that
something meaningful to say

916
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:26,720
the you know use good judgment quickly
as I think we'll about two minutes

917
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,160
yet

918
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,270
juror news

919
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,180
some point I'll cannibalizing

920
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,550
sure way

921
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:43,580
you know him

922
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,270
song

923
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,060
s high-frequency broadcasting they can't
do that because high frequency

924
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,190
broadcasting

925
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:57,350
is are regulated by actually a worldwide
bottom known as the ICU

926
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:00,990
on the International Telecommunication
Union see surely free was these online

927
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,230
gaming and

928
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:07,070
are sharing my everyone in the world Lee
we are going on sale for 15

929
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,120
and I can guarantee you there are other
stations

930
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,370
around the plant that operate on 741 via
also

931
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:16,720
so if the government comes in and says
well we're gonna awesome awesome

932
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,860
followed by there's no mechanism to do
that I mean I simply could do that

933
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,610
someday

934
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,880
but I don't think that I we'll see

935
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,650
any way there's a mechanism to do that
because

936
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:31,880
these frequencies are on a shared
non-interference basis world one

937
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:37,120
%uh who got money one question questions
what

938
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,250
response all from in the red commercial
use immunity

939
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,710
there has been some changes in SEC
policy lately

940
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:48,470
and used to in order to complain about

941
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:53,780
holder or little retarded provided
written transcript although

942
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:58,110
program and/or is table the program to
the SEC

943
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:02,830
the last to three months maybe it change
the law so now this %uh told the SEC

944
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,600
about it

945
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,650
and you have a law and all written
evidence

946
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,200
and no official his all any violation

947
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,400
and the SEC will pursue and go after
stations moreover indecent material

948
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,980
also in the last year all basically
since the German changed

949
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,190
there's been and marketing Res in the
narrow

950
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:27,150
prosecution said the recisions that
they've gone after

951
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,280
content I so there are a lot of stations
out there

952
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,720
gets here yesterday and unfortunately
the SEC does do what we call this this

953
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,060
clean sweeps

954
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:40,320
this somebody gets a hero in there you
know what

955
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,780
and they go out on a star you know
picking our stations one by one

956
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:50,010
I guess we got close but all I can say
is if you're interested free radio

957
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:54,380
to your whole or lot summations on the
net is a lot of books available I think

958
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,080
this is what's available at the

959
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,090
pocket calculator who then on the second
floor

960
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,650
are just be careful use good common
sense

961
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:06,030
and she got on with us a WBC 2.9

962
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:10,170
to learn a little about international
sure way and if you access to the

963
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,800
airwaves and you know

964
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,100
we we we can help you out there is tons
a box around

965
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,080
I'll with the technology and and how to
do it because there's a lot of people

966
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,520
that want access

967
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,710
and hopefully someday the government
will really listen

968
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:29,260
and start licensee amateur radio
stations on the short wave on the AM on

969
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:36,260
event at cetera et cetera thank you on
