so I'm on top a let's see

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,900
my hair is the Joey my

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,710
spent five years than are vying and
country mostly in digital signal

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,500
processing

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,700
communications modulation state issues

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,900
a balanced life work has been
researching

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,180
peer network our pleasure your for all

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,370
and I was like our design telethon

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,000
been

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
our hardware communication systems and
the

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,900
now it's going back to you you know
building stuff on my own i guess i

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,470
industry and as I think it takes the fun
out something doing for a living

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,490
and church project for many people here

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,020
a so if there's a any questions 1 I'll I
intervention

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,619
almost pressure to a layperson

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,500
villagers itself %uh he worked on them

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,310
offers a few questions the this together

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,969
the ball rolling and the like the the
alteration and a

24
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:23,390
questions that they made

25
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,580
a the you know care style

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,080
0

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,810
hatcher

have six years history

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,440
general all wiring

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,600
technologies electronics sources

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,070
Merlot here a and

32
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,860

just halsell first please go away so
I'll

35
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,140
and got along those lines so

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,200
okay alriiight so my first question

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,920
and people is a good one I people think
that is a Alabama about

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,010
and the only reason why a

39
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,160
people don't have very high data rate a

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,329
systems but the SEC and

41
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,450
thinking about how I get show that
double shot it with israeli

42
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,900
come on it's getting more people this it

43
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,900
but i wanna get a job and it is very

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,820
joe Manchin s1 scares we have walnut

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,400
too many people we have here are I

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,410
that as false because yesterday

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,750
the number and no reason why has a crush

48
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,799
irish lotto every so often I truest
hahaha children

49
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:03,060
and is I and he does the range to hit
the icy

50
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,110
come out I i it follow the line

51
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,489
today a sometimes just while all eyes
back my head

52
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm goes it bro

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,620
and not too long ago yeah

54
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,570
are doing much a and not too long ago
there's an Argos the

55
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,250
the that all the technology coming out
which said it was just increase

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,320
bandwidth than that

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,510
now is going at midnight yes stopping
this is the

58
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,130
so his his gf and a radio industry

59
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,190
and the and eighteen years she won't
prevent

60
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,200
yeah the average Joe from from getting
its a

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,270
so be there there the monopoly of
communications that

62
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,950
bullshit horny its that's the bottom
line

63
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,640
well there it was very fun no work done
by a very very

64
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,790
going man by of shit only point

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,260
he is the founder was called information
here only the

66
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,380
him earlier few people really pushes
this

67
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,750
there's a poor he actually laid out what
it is

68
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,180
fundamental mathematical relations 5

69
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,690
natural asking for any chance it to the
maximum capacity per channel

70
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,910
with related to Bay a logarithm

71
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,270
%uh the sitting on a bridge with this
said

72
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,510
was at years absolutely no noise

73
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,890
in jail zero noise as an artist you know

74
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,890
not none whatsoever yes you have it
today

75
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,640
chance has your he should have 200

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,690
noise complaint on a fluctuations and

77
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,280
the place is Tony are launched a number
of things like that

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,860
on and what ends up happening is that
this noise wall

79
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,050
a clout divisions imagine taking looking
at

80
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,930
a who's ever get the hardest okay as she

81
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,950
letters you need to redesign you get
down to the bottom lines eg a smaller

82
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,650
newsletters

83
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,270
you're a bit more along the lines the
only more let's say

84
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,930
you take up the issue a black ski pro
that

85
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,790
that line with you lower bar you also
pick up most the symbols are revealed

86
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,360
was so it's hard as you increase in
number she's a lot

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,400
p and brother a that you know that
office on

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,190
it comes near impossible to branches
some

89
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,100
that's when we really is a communication
channel chance if there is your noise

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,720
you can pack

91
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,830
infinitely many symbols the be

92
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,409
by the the proposals for example

93
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,460
television signal into that and a

94
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,810
noise blurs the area between about you

95
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,190
single and so it ends up happening is
that is very difficult actually make

96
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,390
that distinction between

97
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,469
different them bozos and is just the
same way with beer yeah but you know

98
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,800
page from a problem large number

99
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,280
letters Road tried I G now

100
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,110
technology sprint spectrum a they say oh
yeah and his lawyer available really

101
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,530
like you a sprint spectrum

102
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,580
it more local access technologies %ah

103
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,140
basically other way you will too that
having people

104
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,740
change for 310 you

105
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,229
take their single it may be behind her
100 the

106
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,630
but it won't killers what and you mix it
in with

107
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,080
a a square wave which one to 100 times
higher rate than your support other

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,090
channel there's no

109
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,099
100 homes while that doesn't mean we
have more family

110
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,560
as a idea of data rate transmission

111
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,630
they either single take more than one
reason why

112
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,130
because he did different a where we
differencing

113
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,580
whose to singles can kinko I

114
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,789
and haha CDL space same time that
doesn't mean that you know you're

115
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:50,469
getting there were

116
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,669
free used to one buys one killers job
though

117
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,840
you know other times larger without
getting a decision today

118
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,289
and the other person's life change face
reason why it is called

119
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:08,289
really get was called theoretical name
basically when that

120
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:15,050
to give it a single his point only by
the spreading her

121
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,330
and a flush it up dollars as president
knows

122
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,520
a carefully time-space a

123
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,969
noted that also when the officer then

124
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,469
receiver you have always the machine he
break it out a whole

125
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:34,219
a mobile Pasha

126
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:39,789
the modulation a just makes and sprint
hit one from now they have a firewall to

127
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,370
just you spread on be with the branch
out into that

128
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,370
TV just shortly thank you very being
waged in systems on it

129
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:59,960
that day

130
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,590
for questions thinking yeah is

131
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,170
way as a similar to the way the cable
modems working over the same line

132
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,440
cable television's that something Lois
up

133
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,860
that just people to the but what i'm
talking

134
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,860
where'd busy all year cable TV I

135
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,170
13 space and all your that but I leave

136
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,380
I filed sp nothing that will help DSL
DSL lines

137
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,909
which is between zero three daughters
and the assault chain like I think

138
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,070
dollars and homemakers

139
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,610
was on that way over the line so long
Bonita yes I'll

140
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,979
is the key you know all the action is
also popular

141
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,710
you know about a this action

142
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,290
back to the SL this is why the cable
company they got beat up

143
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,300
top economies at the assault really bad

144
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,680
I quality had a great but

145
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,870
I the winds are designed to carry

146
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,650
that while single I was searching on our
customers in the area

147
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,100
all others are weeding from Joe and its
authority

148
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,670
so this weekend in with your mom

149
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,439
up the reason why came busy he is like
trying to run example

150
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,620
a tragedy believed it was the pair

151
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,690
and productivity you know which channel
I

152
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,690
quality that's it spirit exactly phone

153
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,540
years old a issue but has a

154
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,250
and well for this code division multiple
access

155
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,640
cDNA probes this million

156
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,640
star thing but it

157
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,880
bustle

158
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,390
the campus series folds Hills

159
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,520
guessing day with his way following

160
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,380
had three cars three-course meal
everyone else the cable television role

178
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,790
tragic cost a 2005

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,550
and in the neighborhood and then from
there saw

226
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,589
actually that we're on to something else

227
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,640
the there's a lot of people talking
about dark fiber

228
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,000
that this you know fiber circuit layout
that

229
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,430
my but a reason for this is because
again

230
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,240
French so I they say you know I love
this one where I

231
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
work you're just a guess about fifty
years corner

232
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
thirty years so it's Elena cute about 5
and

233
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,250
cases they all along Bowl at a bar by
Richelle this

234
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,440
I'll people are going out and

235
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:01,440
developing very very that modulation
techniques 5 I know that friend

236
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,640
and the Italian yes great runs like I
think a hundred dollars is moving to

237
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,430
forty powers it will or maybe a hundred
dollars by me on the economy

238
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,600
100 separate for forty or 100 separate
major champ don't believe us

239
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,630
yet you think those powers as well women
saw

240
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,890
bottle the redline you know

241
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,279
between I think they're right now for
you 90 100 whether

242
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,570
just under 40 other we went down to
little five

243
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,130
nearly 1.5 play past me actually I think
most likely

244
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,640
low more or less because they're really
while or

245
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,860
he was shot down

246
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,720
and of course I'm by at

247
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,410
I'll a

248
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,980
fired all yep

249
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,820
Wireless all as

250
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,510
to make his not by which expenses the
labor costs like okay

251
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,649
but I think shes working y los as I so
much stuff

252
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:07,180
that whoever comes down to a it

253
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,260
I think that while this is a effective
way to do it

254
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,959
I think drive percy crop of and

255
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,050
India or there are the wild

256
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,459
realize because a in a way these

257
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,490
hunt you are I was that lucky but
there's a

258
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,490
the term was used way in this

259
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,950
that deserve it both liberal revolution
I was called

260
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,130
the the water happens and why I was at

261
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,339
a United States and the like there is
risk a loser

262
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,589
for any depression and we're salvos
industrial

263
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,930

264
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,329
at all revolution mover grants I turned
out of sight of

265

I I decided to say

284
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,860
second to get away from his mind I

285
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,730
as I take issue with here economic
analysis

286
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,799
when it comes down to it the Soviet
Union didn't have any advantage

287
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,960
by starting as country North Korea is
not have any advantage starting from

288
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,549
scratch

289
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:30,639
yes 0 I experience

290
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:34,370
picking market participants me their
chance

291
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,539
getting right the first time out is like
all

292
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:40,590
obvious using the term historian use
history

293
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,939
and a must in every way first dates out
trees god

294
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,019
rugby I think I have any new singer I
just how to build

295
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:52,200
for the game more than 10 sorry place in
Germany

296
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,249
at the bottom line is a but his way
there of technology over there

297
00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:00,389
and as you know I some date and and get
the bill home country

298
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,570
technology had some day and must have
all you know

299
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:09,249
and bystanders period like to give the
okay I just knew new stuff yes you can

300
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,610
use on japan's example in Japan as

301
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,460
you are as follows: almost no on channel
signaling their infrastructure

302
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,410
they just because they have to buy
planning and roll it out

303
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,410
I don't know it so much experiencing
thinking the

304
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,260
the people that are meaningful than ever
out and there's only a handful of us

305
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,379
at all aspirants decades can move in
Chaska

306
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,870
big problem five obstructions and what
is is a

307
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,970
are biotechnology a

308
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,010
fiber optics a are a lot like

309
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,360
while shall yeah he had a lot of the
same characteristics and that

310
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,080
is the first or second order distortions
think that

311
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,090
the cost burden via as from ha

312
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,240
the 11 family and impurities fire
tokyo's seriously

313
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,940
fiber mister this may be the Christian
world Japan role lol

314
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,260
was and what turned happening was that
when you have yours for

315
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,980
firings though the second third or
characteristic when you're passenger the

316
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,160
United States what they do is a few

317
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,419
one wrong I love a partial run love

318
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,210
one hopes for an hour harder on archives
for

319
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,230
by bringing him to trial so happy we're
getting better

320
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,169
five-hour production johnnie but that's
because a

321
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:30,840
yeah be washed across Royale yeah 50
before

322
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,530
people who register asking get a
question more

323
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,649
friend him

324
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,410
a we have one on

325
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,630
a registered address: University and we
just acquired

326
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,429
a on the university's law school
medicine we'll weaver

327
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,950
I give it lifestyle laser connection

328
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,160
over the spot yeah the dam across and

329
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,840
and I i think that any technology long
as I think it's great

330
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,090
and was developing something that I
think is great photo for

331
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,059
optician is a challenge people I think
that you know

332
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:19,149
I mean believe like all the other is why
we've got high speed connection to their

333
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,559
own houses pornography

334
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,559
and with now on pornography drive
technology the reason why

335
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,920
the do

336
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,210
guy I wish I was joking you know why

337
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,210
it was a superior technology page s the
reason why VHS

338
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,340
I want to be just all you know at BHS is
going to happen I G

339
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,419
and nationwide it because the HST

340
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,440
achieve this you know so if people were
you know

341
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,380
making pornography decide this year VHS
tapes to the cheaper and you on a lot

342
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:54,930
form

343
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,030
by VHS VCR all right now I think

344
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,540
for all I know the reason why he is so
popular posing multi-angle

345
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:07,020
for a but i wanna I'm

346
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,920
diet once they figure out how to get
movies in space right he wants

347
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,670
technologies

348
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,830
what they fear I do is look at point on
I like a lossy

349
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,919
had a lot like you know high data rates
are handsets

350
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,640
who knows tough questions

351
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,010
I'm so I may walk away a

352
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,780
buzzword I

353
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,170
can you comment you have any see any
knowledge on a

354
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,560
82 that sixteen and she wants to know
that aids

355
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,179
a dated to that the 11 peña

356
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,320
but just and 16 which is supposed to be
the next

357
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,649
the hissing said to 11 be hey

358
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,960
Angie angie is best the beverage for be
everything

359
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,990
for 16 you d he just did something

360
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,680
was at all less miles 50 I wouldn't know
a lot of my

361
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,290
the actual also and can you know

362
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,800
tonight beats I N any of your experience
or knowledge

363
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,710
but that the difference between CDMA
GPRS

364
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,610
Hawaii he's in steel did wireless
technology

365
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,370
on cell phone his solo we speak up

366
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,540
they us yeah I love

367
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,370
de Passy technology is there to go very
high data rate

368
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,460
subs reason why technology not there
just yet

369
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,240
is technology take a final decision and
there's no

370
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,430
there's no demand you have high
generation iPhones

371
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,240
again if there's some plain yet porn on
your phone

372
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,530
and then they don't want it I mean it's
one hand

373
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,300
my hands on russia

374
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:00,800
and fellow I mean I was sooo subway
Georgia

375
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,460
again its existing infrastructure
whereas we having this thing

376
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,170
CNAME structure where other countries

377
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,530
of justifying that technology will this
go the latest thing

378
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,230
why spend all this money as into the
reason why the japanese a prolific not

379
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,880
so fast is that their population that is
so high

380
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,440
hero a single 3G cell devoted you know
service for more people that's what

381
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,020
number two

382
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,500
reason why everyone from TDM her mom
from campus

383
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,350
did he made a CDMA here will squeeze
three possible urs

384
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,770
in for every one can stop and berries

385
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,770
CEVA your squeeze 308 customers and

386
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:43,700
practically for everyone team-best so
what happens is that once also a

387
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,650
a you the solvent part is I'll playful

388
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,580
for a lot of dollars a drop in no place
until the point where

389
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,720
01 that sell no one offers many years
until the

390
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,100
costume making a phone call is less than
the cost electricity

391
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,890
and the television saw and that's that
all i care about. they will get sick

392
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,810
smokers and for a spot where one problem
before

393
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:09,990
this all more outlook to stable me you
know it's more a cash flow

394
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,640
that's the reason why May 21 2010 NCAA
and

395
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,050
alabaster was because you know its
better

396
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:22,030
quality rater that and I'll be a happy
to answer your teammate when you

397
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,220
first about worse because you know
reference coverage in

398
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,870
digital a noise much hard unit

399
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,060
pics then alleles

400
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:39,060
you

401
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,410
its what is

402
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,410
I think he made nine your voice is just
a lurker cases involve your own

403
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,770
mahler vocal track and yeah it other
than the repeated question

404
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,980
the point is really out of the question
was a it wasn't a question

405
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,280
homicide and so is still far better than
see energy main reason why is because

406
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,350
any interest is is a vocoder as
digitizes

407
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,980
do a reconstruction that lemme it's not
much for the noise

408
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,050
issues but the fact that they all
sweetie six people I for one channel

409
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,600
action China Sea may systems a jack n

410
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,080
for more people want to see a single
minute do over here so

411
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,929
result crap over there but you'll get
more you know the hospital

412
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,530
have a question I it is just a technical
question yes I received any phone from

413
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,260
verizon

414
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,040
and idaho not such a

415
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,200
I I was told by Verizon that I get home
forty kilobits per second by buying

416
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,000
expensive

417
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,580
I you naked and to all my friends
disagree with me say that

418
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,760
probably can get a menu that what's your
opinion on that as a CDMA phone

419
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,530
yet he said 140 kilobits per second here

420
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,050
NEC and thank goodness action I

421
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,440
think this email us your job like this
like female voters also between 24

422
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,670
Nevada and

423
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,390
way ok to use my dad has a little
something

424
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,120
I up she is probably do it was not

425
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,020
there's no single space out there doing
but I'll give you a lot a lot of

426
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,760
customers

427
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,760
because me missus is never held

428
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,250
as I really good really yeah a question
here

429
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,780
kuwait as Mike know although also just
got over here

430
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,040
I think this down yeah I seventy degrees

431
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,440
in korea they have about 10 customers
with situation one st and

432
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,620
3 the throughput of 144 K connection is

433
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,200
about sixty or seventy real not

434
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,760
data rate which is great the I

435
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,540
so it works like this who knows it's

436
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,760
yeah I think I think part is also

437
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,760
it will work 399 when I was about to hop

438
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,980
expecting their cell phones but now I
mean this is where to go

439
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,490
well you know it people were ordered him
a little may probably longer chat with

440
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,220
those who this

441
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,590
is a very successful right now this is
not a lot of people's topic or Spencers

442
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,450
I mean are

443
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:29,280
one of the security of a CDMA phone
someone is that a landline phones more

444
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,320
secure than

445
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,439
cell phones alive because their
cellphones most mainland eiffel

446
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,260
I mean %uh for someone else to over your
conversation on the phone

447
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,190
a I know it he make budget problems some
bottled

448
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,250
conversations the sole ownership day
selling leadership

449
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,180
that told dole as well say one thing any

450
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,170
it comes out to get him to surrender

451
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,990
nothing's impossible were not want more
secure another

452
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,270
author withheld on the I mean that shit

453
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,120
the problem is I'm being with it and you
know curator your phone

454
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,230
which section pretty small the same time
you know there are 108 no

455
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,470
mass on most handsets by

456
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:22,090
very which is it's only Mary half-mile
radius

457
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,500
independently our environment just on
being in that range was thinking when

458
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,000
you actually got her number

459
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,650
this yeah baseline our

460
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:38,159
about

461
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,399
know it but still thank you were sitting
there are when I was in your cell phone

462
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:46,279
conversation there are people who have
more things to do in their lives in this

463
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,730
you all of surprise every day it is

464
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:56,730
a here

465
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:03,750
but also they said their instantaneous
had their fill of haha raises a data

466
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,120
model

467
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,019
and also this hey your one conversation
everyone else's

468
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:11,110
I was talking about crack bells okay

469
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,600
it's also lost your phone callers on the
value of

470

it you where there's

700
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,549
yet he do that if you put like a llego
motor resistor across it I'm usually

701
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:15,420
kept asking yes

702
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,119
