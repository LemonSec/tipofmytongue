116
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,130
you're right and it follows me
throughout the entire process

117
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,320
doesn't matter where you are being
interrogated

118
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,590
even if you started talking and gave my
name

119
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,820
I get home I was going awesome

120

this asked questions about my
solicitations groups have long

121
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,880
I can always involve ongoing

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,820
means once too long

123
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,849
you think do that in the meantime you
can start talking again

124
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,490
go honeymoons must be

125
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,080
milo new never game me most people think
they can talk

126
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,440
their way I'll publicly situation

127
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,060
he's almost never happens when you start
talking

128
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,420
putting yourself in jeopardy possibly
more than people generally

129
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,420
often

130
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,000
protest situation

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,889
means or involved in

132
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,319
what aid in political world suspicious
political world actually the

133
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,439
gather intelligence no really care that

134
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,439
spin on the sidewalk or fuel

135
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,340
changing nurse only relieving

136
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,110
haha convention they wanna sing on
information 10

137
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,230
who you know what was going on and we'll
start with the innocuous questions

138
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,830
the thing is it's lame to do this and
its

139
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,650
you know they're trying to do this often
they're very good

140
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:43,340
and you almost never gain anything by
talking to the police

141
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,640
bust of a law enforcement Jenny the best
of amendments I am

142
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,160
to even talk to the lawyer you can
always talk to them later

143
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,520
you know they're always blame him which
to say

144
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,699
lane so is is 10

145
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,430
I know it's very tempting that when it
stopped by law enforcement asking simple

146
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,070
questions

147
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,540
where you going did you come from the
subway this is the foot in the door

148
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,800
in the murky past more more questions
today

149
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,130
what they want also when you see the
purchase of a legal

150
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,189
panel me say something innocuous
immediate misconstrued

151
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,520
or they may try to catch you up on what
they think

152
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,079
danger line about them hospital views
needs

153
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,700
importantly how missus quite
intimidating especially its FBI

154
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,330
or something like that into your
stocking on the street

155
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,360
while quite intimidating you can learn
to use police

156
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,790
in law enforcement are a la jolla

157
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,209
too long its holding the game a lot a
lot

158
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,490
legally live to live my life all

159
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,490
on all that in fact delage do said sale

160
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,630
you shouldn't believe me they say oh
well you know

161
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,990
you see this person have somebody

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,310
United States on so another words

333
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,570
pays both activity that

334

is trying to influence policy yes

335
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,560
teeny some can be construed as tears

336
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,560
T

337
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,850
yeah posse of a government

338
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,050
okay and you'll see in the hall raised

339
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,590
this dot com that was very important
that

340
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,530
stay you read to trying to charge in

341

as domestic tales recently treated

342
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,800
as

343
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,520

acting human life and it's dangerous to
human life

345
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:02,139
when you lose into how that has been
termed advising law enforcement agencies

346
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,470
including the FBI

347
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,860
things are like what would have been
traditionally

348
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,070
pieces you know civil disobedience

349
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,419
blocking the intersection it's
considered no

350
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,920
as possibility dangerous team impact

351
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,450
emergency vehicles can and the trouble
is that

352
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,560
ledgers a lot more light into

353
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,750
to someone's claiming to check it we
have a lot of jobs out there

354
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,750
skittles

355
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,320
something relating to internet usage

356
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,429
%uh yet talks about these

357
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:52,620
pen registers entrapment response the

358
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,409

362
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:15,080
months relevant to

363
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,559
any ongoing criminal investigation so
it's

364
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,610
kinda moving away from just British
terrace

365
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,490
for intelligence this activities

366
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:35,490
Jan hottie being allowed to gather

367

if they're investigating me for whatever
for

370
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,260
you know failing to pay taxes like that

371
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,370
by this they monitor

372
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,870
my not only my usage on the Internet
going to

373
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,300
Tasha sister sites but they could extend
into

374
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,450
email correspondence going both ways to
different people

375
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,840

loving criminal activity on time home
now

377
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,640
even be are and knowledgeable than

378
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,550
engaged in suspicious activity but they
would still be

379
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,200
in the mountains see force engines

380
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,890
one big changes that previous to this

381
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,960
physically law enforcement persons
opposed to go to a judge

382
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,850
to get a warns the wiretap know why it
happens is he just one phone number one

383
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,150
Lee

384
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,940
now with us basically that happens to a
person

385
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,190
stage have communication on that person
inlet hose

386
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:55,980
unit which I wish to get it as a major
change right there's no judicial review

387
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,530

pantry

632
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,719

library on his website

638
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:59,710

639
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,380
human life any because he wishes

640
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,749
he hasn't handled the siege and he
wishes changes in government

641

were concerned

645
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:28,140
the domestic terrorists you never
claimed to harlem

646
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,839
was basically completely based you can
be a political you can be a domestic

647
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:33,480
animals

648
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,759
IBM have any cell home have been
publicly

649
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:39,950
new someone based on some stuff from
home

650
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,999
on the website allman individually
perfectly legal

651
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:48,499
but I guess in combination they thought

652
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:51,680
at the time that it might be you legal

653
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,269
now most homes most the your situation

654
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:58,640
he was the public affairs officer for
the US Attorney's Office

655
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,299
after 13 days he dropped the charges he
was

656
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:06,690
is quoted as saying we've opted not to
seek an indictment this time

657
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,390
we're continuing to investigate the
matter the right now

658
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:15,390
he's off the hook call he still has the
sort of Damocles hanging over him

659
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:19,299
Paso they're like okay then let him go

660
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:22,640
it's not clear one of the reasons
talking to his

661
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,769
are lawyer and other people close to the
case

662
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:29,309
and what he believes in time team to
evening on

663
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:33,029
contact they believe that they were
going

664
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:37,719
that the lawyers in his case is going to
take a lot of this

665
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,619
information make it public wiretaps
because

666
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:45,339
he believes Anderson evidence thus
pointed that the FBI

667
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:48,788
was actually hacking him news in his
email

668
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:52,710
homes in doing all this under stop

669
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,259
but he didn't get me please he still
under surveillance for being

670
00:42:56,259 --> 00:42:57,900
understanding one's

671
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,719
forever no he still hasn't and stuff but
his website

672
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:05,359
is back up those are some things that
the Patriot Act

673
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,239
has made possible that million was
impossible

674
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:12,660
prior to that time that kinda lately

675
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,279
mom

676
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,680
must terrorist Jonny Howson both

677
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,190
recipe follows the more the searches
scare also this

678
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,400
military tribunal it's been set up

679
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,220
and it's something all the store chamber
basically where

680
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,470
the Washington 56 people from the
attorney general's office and some

681
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,130
people from the pub offense

682
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,680
and basically say that it up a body navy
judge

683
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,980
we're gonna go out on a the officiating
addition being somebody

684
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,850
and the scariest like as an attorney on

685
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,750
is not having access to apply I got a
call from them

686
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,070
inflow love case Pakistani boy

687
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:58,340
doctor happen to be a Canadian citizen
was picked up by immigration charge

688
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,250
on and as hundreds of thousands of
people that are in violation

689
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,770
technically on some innovation will on

690
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,120
regulation or another on but

691
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,049
in this case the world to prevent it the
Metropolitan Detention Center

692
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,770
and the Bunnymen on have a shambles

693
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,270
the scary part is it to us where he was
at first

694
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,230
it into a feeding he was there and

695
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,470
as lawyers for the first time that way
I'll

696
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:32,260
actually I got filled want for the
problems

697
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,130
as I see it as a way it's below people

698
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:39,440
they're really trying to create this
division between your right

699
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,420
military already to counsel

700
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,340
and so they've been holding people now
they've been charging that

701
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,220
is someone that's in there that on this
missus material witness

702
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,630
innings for the crime they will have
access to it injury

703
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,260
so it's really important I'll david has

704
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,170
symmetries number missus onassis losses
let people know that you go away for a

705
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:03,820
few days

706
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,680
on and also to try to be the presses

707
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,750
on the fun in the media many many cases
to be actually a friend

708
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,050
because what they is

709
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:18,400
please if federal law people walk is

710
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,940
is basically the trader pull people off
another day 10 so

711
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,140
if you know someone that's being work
call the National Lawyers Guild

712
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,810
all the peoples of Earth fully make sure
that this

713
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:33,520
is a firstly under questioning all

714
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,870
you for pasta made obviously like a lot
of things

715
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,700
along my lappy is fifteen hundred
dollars and

716
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,849
mp3 players and

717
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:46,690
he has is just like that are is there a
lot of stealing by

718
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,710
these the 80s all of this summer
stealing there's a lot of incompetence

719
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,460
Mar with police depends on the sea

720
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,369
New York is a gigantic huge bureaucracy
I'm sure some steam goes

721
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:04,880
about more often than not I think a lot
of these

722
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,380
simply harassment you know making
comeback over and over again

723
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,550
and a lot of its incompetence I have
been lucky

724
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,910
the times I've been a massive that my
stuff

725
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:21,730
sometimes on their stuff them belong to
me on the people not been so lucky

726
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,770
are it but movie do the rest no give you
she

727
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:30,369
have stuff to do taking you wanna make
sure you read that carefully

728
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,740
and make sure you add each and every
item

729
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,740
additional there's no perfect way to
guarantee

730
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,680
on this long shot but also with the you

731
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,930
this network there's Mac just

732
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,290
basically year old again file she

733
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:05,290
cell case on poultry somehow discovers
track

734
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,569
home for small was the PLC's phone
number

735
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:19,660
in case they get arrested the Aussies
follow

736
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:25,029
loans really useful to get lessons is on
Mon 17

737
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:28,519
807 06 5a

738
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:32,950
was another web site she also said we
were the first but now there's a number

739
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,329
of

740
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:37,319
anarchist and other on legal collectors
and

741
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:43,940
lot in cities like Philadelphia washing
members

742
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,130
I it's not a sin easy address itself

743
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,529
www down ky 80

744
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:55,269
dot com power and then

745
00:47:55,269 --> 00:48:01,470
slash NYC PLC ok a couple quick
questions I i

746
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,769
there's probably no succinct answer to
this but one of them is

747
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:08,410
on you know is it changing the
government

748
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,730
a basic right that we have a
non-participating in the political

749
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,660
process as

750
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,230
public so this does this in any way you
know

751
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,980
you don't have anything to do with
Watson

752
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,200
the page for that you know that home

753
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:30,009
earlier you want to change in government
a fundamental are we love change

754
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:34,029
decide eventual that we want socialism
in this country

755
00:48:34,029 --> 00:48:37,029
on obviously try and prevent that

756
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:40,690
but on don't we you have that is a basic
right

757
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,990
and white you know how's that I love you
law and

758
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,470
you hope so right for

759
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,319
we had to fight for as the other
question the other issues since when is

760
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,130
there something

761
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,130
people come to me I think the waves
where

762
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:59,839
trade with the biggest play I go back to
Aston

763
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,180
member Americans yeah system into the
steam

764
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,410
yeah you know what does that have to do
with this

765
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,828
said smoothies you know just on

766
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:13,480
people looking at holidays love said
that the British coming around

767
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,849
to see them here the same Monte

768
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:19,869
missus don't you remember

769
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:23,920
what else about this thing on some
people did and what is that

770
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,759
in like the soldiers bursting into your
you know

771
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:31,400
all homes just just to check two teams

772
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,069
your people and said the hood why is
that

773
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:39,589
in the funny the American Revolution all
the all the soldiers coming into a house

774
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:43,990
so I think what happens is isn't working
age people in dialogue you know

775
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,799
and see who's the bigger issue I mean I
think other problems that

776
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:51,339
few way the flashlights the left leg
with months

777
00:49:51,339 --> 00:49:55,710
thing at some point maybe this is the
same question

778
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:59,839
the same answer with with these want
Lewis and administrative

779
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:04,099
wants is on how we could bounce back as
individuals

780
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:07,470
you know in on cases and and as a nation
are

781
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,369
how to restore balance well

782
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:14,490
I think the you know from our
perspective as

783
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:18,380
anarchist look like that we don't
believe

784
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,589
that the criminal justice system you
know

785
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:24,730
is a fair system trustees believe

786
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,609
it's important despite descends that

787
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:32,740
you know people go out on the streets
people continuing resistance

788
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,990
in continue to change society the best
that they can

789
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,960
more we do is people's look like that
isn't is intended to help people

790
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,690
mitigate

791
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:47,119
basic injustices in the system probably
not going to move get the kind just as

792
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,000
your time

793
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,660
within the system which is here make
sure that condone

794
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:58,660
way for excessively long homes well as a
as a look at that

795
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:03,920
document in all its references so many
other acts

796
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,930
it's obvious that these works for a very
long time

797
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:12,210
this shopping list Street here wish list

798
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:15,000
Doha this company

799
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,470
whose arm I covered a story

800
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:22,590
middle 2001 and I

801
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,680
it was a congressional hearing we're

802
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,090
'em he was revealed of yes

803
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:32,960
just quite accidentally that the Fiserv

804
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,810

the pretext that the white sheet K

805
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:41,279
for spent below world a

806
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,520
and didn't and what I also from the way
these people talking

807
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,850
was the the it had been rolled back at
that time and

808
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,870
one person who's in in the FBI saying
one thing

809
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:56,960

Notre 'em and

813
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:11,140

on the biggest stories a the year song

815
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,130

825
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,560
