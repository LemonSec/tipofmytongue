1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:03,659
low

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,830
this is Jon Erickson will be giving a
talk titled

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,769
password probability making us

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:19,769
%ah

5
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,040
okay are I

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,870
on are sleight-of-hand

7
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,300
he is a lovely alright I understand

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,110
go into a yes

9
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,200
dork dozen cluster of the I mean

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,030
dollars just star are

11
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,150
alright

12
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,270
for those who you are lot no way I'll

13
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,340
as winter Ashton that sounds this yeah

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,390
on my fund expense with God one-way hash
function which means

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,180
no way to reverse it just messin

16
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,159
one was a great

17
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,210
you can't take cipher text the test

18
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,100
reproduce the point X teasing are
conventional methods just another

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,340
rivers flow %uh so just little

20
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,060
pros that explains it here the plain
text test

21
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,590
is credited with the salt GE there's a

22
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,040
action 12 its assault for the stuff
passwords

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,310
and then the Haskins frail its starts
out with her

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,540
salt GE

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,540
there's eleven jurors potential hash and

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,799
all the information in the plaintext is
equally diffused through

27
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,440
so text so yeah

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,819
and this number stored in at sea bass or
whatever to show

29
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,290
and when you log in the next are you
taking whatever it a day

30
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,340
to login and the result of the file

31
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,680
%uh cribs we take in with the salt and
checks the last 11

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,069
characters and see if they match they
match what you typed and as we take in

33
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:33,800
when you

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,980
story better in the first place an
alleged real

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,310
and the logic behind this is son steals
you order

36
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,720
as for the first %uh it makes it more
difficult for them to

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,920
take that and convert it to you are the
plaintext passwords for everyone to cast

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,920
%uh are that everything changes

39
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,420
as Best Lead to are

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,140
okay so we all love dictionary attack is
a can't wait to

41
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,430
try to circumvent this I even though
it's impossible to reverse it

42
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,040
if you tried a whole buncha words in a
dictionary file

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,200
and you pass them with the same salt you
check the results

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,950
as the results tonight much that means a
plain text

45
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,510
dictionary word the UN cashed which
matches %uh

46
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,569
on the ashes in a strong password file
whatever

47
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,720
I'll you know that is what i text is in
his addiction is a word

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,069
to access the system arm

49
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,549
so it's a brute force attack but the
downside to this is

50
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,599
if the pass was planted

51
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,180
is something is not you dictionary file
%uh it will find it so

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,290
the in this example there's a

53
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,439
really hard to other castle's plan on

54
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,030
people stations a bracket three dollars

55
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,849
relievers and their ashes to this with
the salt

56
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,980
and because role words and

57
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,400
the words file and it's not there so can
find it so

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,799
if you really want that ass fucking
exhausted brute force attack

59
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,340
that's where you try it every single
possible plain text

60
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,580
now for these deaths hashed passwords

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,960
itself is not 95 characters

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,900
doesn't allow space for the lovers
numbers symbols is opposing

63
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,280
wanna so for all possible for church
passwords that's not live up to the 4th

64
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,889
or

65
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,410
but a number a $1 million possibilities

66
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,570
so assuming they get about 10 doesn't
crash seconds to take

67
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,620
about to 26 hours and

68
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,690
since you can see the nether

69
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,130
December can grow exponentially when it
is used under your password

70
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,300
sell for five years better to take her
ninety five times law

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,940
$6 K Jha acid intake manifold five times

72
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,020
so and

73
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,500
the SEMATECH its mostly competition
power that's used

74
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,419
to do this stuff %uh okay

75
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,609
right so another way to do

76
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,220
is hard passwords would be to you
precomputed

77
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,860
every possible plain text and its
corresponding cash value and you can

78
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,120
make this message is

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,409
huge lookup table and whenever you want

80
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,520
try to crack the password actually have
to do is look it up I

81
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,070
Dubai research literature be the girls
are natural log

82
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,760
it's pretty fast me that's yeah

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,139
so up the problem here is storage space

84
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,220
since the password hashes are socially
minded

85
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,270
it's really hard to compress reindeer us

86
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,169
Ashley so assume the store every
password forgot password and it s

87
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:06,990
months assault because it's redundant a
plant files not limited characters would

88
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,669
be about

89
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,948
9524 times for Barcelona which is

90
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,110
last part %uh so that that's fell 1.14
gigabytes

91
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,330
and of course this number also grows
exponentially when is under investors

92
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,510
because the exponential growth are you
experienced with

93
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,490
Tony care so this method

94
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,900
is is not the storage space doesn't need
them

95
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,909
much computational power won t already
had a little so

96
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,159
try its

97
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,349
art compress and decompress is a little
bit

98
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:46,210
%uh issue and you might also plain text
%uh

99
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,150
selenite on to the store that if you use
that down to just three fights because

100
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,430
95 24

101
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,529
is less than two to three times a day
soldiers

102
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,940
all is communion rated and to realize so

103
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,060
that's pretty good and that music down
to you

104
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,150
one point serious 6 gigabytes and since
we're just using

105
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,800
a unless keys we never actually used to
it

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,770
searle we can stuff that out and present
learn more

107
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,279
and bring down to you 951 next nets

108
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,289
girl as cute as you can yet a for

109
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,870
compressing it like that without any
loss and

110
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,770
saw 3d all that puzzle impressed by the
eighteen percent

111
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,909
and it's a little space but UK quite a
bit more

112
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,190
captors efforts really worth it so

113
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,560
other in another big flow this thing

114
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,680
is the sole value %uh to explain yeah

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,990
at people who designed the stuff

116
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,440
thought about this stuff hand thus
although you

117
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,599
%uh is designed to prevent this type of
thing

118
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,380
there's a they settle that so for those
I sector possible

119
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,820
salyers and eat plain text

120
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,029
with the different salt interest to
different value

121
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,600
so views tests old AB GE

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,390
live as you can see the shows completely
different reach one

123
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,450
so that means for our

124
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,930
national cable to really be effective
you have to have 2006 different tables

125
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,000
and she don't like and if I style

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
passwords Laura by dislikes 65,000

127
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,360
possibilities please markets all so

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,039
%uh the trade-off here that you can
actually

129
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,449
take advantage of dust reduction in
computational power and storage this

130
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,860
and really exists everywhere arm

131
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,950
as we came up with this idea wilder's
rebellious Lee trying to you

132
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,250
other solve the Hamiltonian cycle
problem

133
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,950
and deterministic time which is a

134
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,200
but there's a problem called anti
complete and

135
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,630
its really hard you're not listening to
do it

136
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,340
and at supposedly and the Eagles D

137
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,690
which means that class it is really hard
problems

138
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,320
are slowly and he doesn't p so suppose
it causes problems are so hard to do

139
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,350
that I'll you can't do then

140
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,700
internist but I'll take exponential time
with respect to you

141
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,690
timbers so I'll try to do this just

142
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,910
because I was told I could and I thought
I had done it using

143
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,689
a universal Turing machine but it turned
out player

144
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,360
I want my pic lists for I was just
adjusting the size L today

145
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,000
and distress %uh that by adjusting the
size L

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,600
the Sigma I could pre calculate stuff in
storage

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,280
in that other so you see this

148
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,540
every day actually %uh in normal
compression

149
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,620
you play mp3's all the time and and it
reduces no space needed for a high

150
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,190
quality song but

151
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,260
yet is locked in a hearty on

152
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,540
rental and that in one direction and

153
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,969
I I think leaders do it the other ways
to look at a table

154
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,000
%uh chuckling citing concerns

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,610
really pretty complex and the little
tyke taxes yet don't want to

156
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,030
they don't need do it that catholics
because he

157
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,540
doesn't list so this makes things look
at a little just look at every possible

158
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,000
thing

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,920
and its is computational power way for
the cost of storage space

160
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,949
%uh the slow saying before about James
Jeans

161
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,860
intermission find it under the more
states facing the last transitions

162
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,650
actually

163
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:49,650
an even trade of that for alright so

164
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,140
%uh fearless the useful for net

165
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,939
david hale trade nixon to the password
cracker so

166
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,160
we can see this having a strike price
lookup table

167
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,850
but were not able to save in their lives
a little space for text more competition

168
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,290
effort actually use the data

169
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,300
so I want to take this even further and
to make like a hybrid approach

170
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,710
and is a try and find this

171
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,770
the spot between exhausted forced to

172
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,060
and a a table lookup

173
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,820
which'll lady do the a lady the problem

174
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,830
exhausted for search using %uh

175
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,570
significantly reduced file that has
protected

176
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,420
valves so arm

177
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,979
yes it should first

178
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,980
other

179
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,000
right

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,399
a sister several proper so

181
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,399
what they would you do something simple
like test right

182
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,190
at this is the file this next programs
can be using

183
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:19,190
today to follow as it sits on 141
neighborhoods

184
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,950
so

185
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,860
alright so

186
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,920
this prospect to the acid test
contestant

187
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,229
this we partisan to this thing

188
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:44,230
its

189
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:59,250
hollers assessment test should have
waited on this image

190
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,339
added let me get back to where it was so
are

191
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,790
so well that while it actually is a 3.2
metres by New Delhi is

192
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,389
and I seconded equivalent exhaust the
force using

193
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:22,509
reasonable must Artspace so instead of
having is that cash look at a table like

194
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,639
your doctor before

195
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,699
this method is losses so the end result
is you tell it

196
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:32,190
you ask it with the plaintext reinvest
services

197
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,380
to give you the exact results is this

198
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,490
that we test %uh returns up the world

199
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,290
80,000 use any those are the ones that
will probably

200
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,519
that it knows will probably be in space

201
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,420
looking for so reduces other that he's
busy a search for

202
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,529
to another 80,000 possibilities which
human

203
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:59,290
eight seconds if this dosent crash site
so

204
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,269
leaders this is this little tunnel I
need

205
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:07,050
telephones which turned out to be

206
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,810
presley sensors 12 percent the original
tale of which is peace

207
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,000
and reduce the key space to you about a
thousand

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
keys so that his visit national
something astronomical actually

209
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,550
so but that equates to is a for sure to
pass a little too salty

210
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,230
the salt for the stable can be

211
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,120
cracked another eight seconds %uh which
would only take

212
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,889
2.2 6 hours using the same

213
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:42,369
over without without is this month

214
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:45,769
so the late listings

215
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,350
is merge into a three-dimensional

216
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,779
binary matrix values %uh so long

217
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,989
the acts miss but the plain text into
pairs for for character the first two

218
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,019
characters inside

219
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:02,839
characters and these two things are
these

220
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,139
pairs are enumerated along access right
so

221
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,509
fresheners me this way so yet

222
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,929
a 95 to the to 9,000 25 this

223
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:18,738
agenda and then so that's Bell a

224
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,549
on does 129 bites so each

225
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:26,129
that after along this way is there and
then

226
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:30,379
along the y-axis are that roams with the
subject to split up into two triples

227
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,019
three

228
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,350
so little nutty 6/4 TV

229
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:41,350
3 done this way PC

230
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,560
and death killers these to the matrices

231
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,490
me the death is just eight counties and
the first four are for the first two

232
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,820
characters are the plaintext

233
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,670
the second for the sector this is linda
S and

234
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,730
each one is a sampling from different
pieces and safe to text

235
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,050
so living by their

236
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,840
is because the South Texas even the

237
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,640
diffused red place at the first 3
characters

238
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,920
services cattle ATA test

239
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,650
ashes to this with the salt GE but also

240
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,730
Eslake like Apple GA francie age

241
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,330
happens to you %uh hash with the same

242
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,880
firstly just so text and all these other
ones like that too

243
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,840
so basic thing one

244
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,200
%uh one others matrices wanted national
ones

245
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,270
for would be for the first two
characters TE

246
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,670
and then the first three churches the
second text and all the ones

247
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,420
that %uh along this real all the plain
text values

248
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,630
that age me would be this way

249
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,860
%uh here's like tene

250
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,180
here maybe and their suppliers because
the

251
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,970
does great escalation point capital J

252
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,510
is maybe right here the new rated %uh 89

253
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,450
one where it's not their zeros

254
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,770
so he's got all these

255
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,069
ones and zeros basically %uh

256
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:26,069
deadly clashes authority mister fung me

257
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,930
yeah Hollywood of are you think you can
explain this

258
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:36,730
are so now the next time something this
GE Capital hehe southerners entered

259
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,310
are the two major change in the days
forty you just

260
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,500
where all have a cig brands the better
life for

261
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,780
where AG is located all those get

262
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,050
inspectors 1,000's just look down at
better

263
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,030
everywhere there's a while that's a
possible thanks

264
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,220
insists the new lady spread out like so
you get

265
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,980
the specter one serious look through it
all they are ready to the possible

266
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,580
values

267
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,280
%uh since there for them and the first
one is for the first

268
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,629
%uh along this way %uh first ones for
the first two years

269
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,800
sector specials for the next two years
it restlessness occurs

270
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,520
text %uh is wall they all have to say
now is to get

271
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,129
complete picture /url yeah but the plant
is it gonna be

272
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,950
so the only if you all for the actors
for the first to hear her say

273
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,150
characters third and fourth Street
characters on the subject

274
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,390
%uh anywhere there ones in the lineup

275
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,700
across all that means that the past %uh

276
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,770
across all for them so that means
actually is a possible to just take

277
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,280
all for those buyers letters %uh and
then together

278
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,010
is just about the alleged and everywhere
you see it one

279
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,750
means that the possible values and one
for the first here's one sec

280
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,770
cares so %uh

281
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,370
the way it is I'm on these things his
eyes and designed it with the physical

282
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,070
principle online but you're not familiar
with that

283
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,379
basically says if K plus one another to
put in 2k max's

284
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,540
least one the boxes will contain two
objects it's pretty simple

285
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,310
busters this many holes you get as much
stuff to put in there

286
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,909
yet more stuff than the whole issue here
one of those holes can take up two spots

287
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,030
so to get his best results you want

288
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:36,060
%uh wonder that interview about 50
percent 16 percent

289
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,360
zeros a little bit less is actually
better for us so we know that we need to

290
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,920
put in

291
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,840
95 24 are hashes

292
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,290
so that only entry need to put in that
sometimes in a 7-1

293
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,990
so a that means me twice as many holes
that gave us the percentage

294
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,260
saturations haha that lets you and then
divide by the number of columns

295
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,540
another for just 64 literally so

296
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,670
somber calls this place for them that's
the teacher just so

297
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,120
text cell when the size that alright

298
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,280
that turns out to be about 18,000
columns

299
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,000
and since reasons after spells much
looking nice

300
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,180
%uh we don't actually use all the third
character witnesses for that

301
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,560
sole use this the first character sector

302
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,919
forbids a lester is a traditional Indian

303
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,750
all the bits even a few service medal
Press actually

304
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,690
nice thing about their so

305
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,790
the for the actors %uh the report for
civil service test

306
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:45,510
and in this matrix it turns out he got
forty percent situations that means

307
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,070
forty-two percent ones thrusters ears so

308
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,100
that means we have for them I like said

309
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,390
any do that that was and other there's

310
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:02,390
0.42 to the fourth 5 2010 5:42 42 each
time you apply the probability of

311
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,590
ones being distributed all car like that
so the other hand in

312
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,909
a one that's a lot all the way through
the bill was and it is

313
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,840
%uh united by love said which means it
reduces

314
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,230
not the number of possibilities for

315
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,900
that chunk by that much so

316
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,090
after you get that reduction that means

317
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,439
there are only about children a
possibility first two characters

318
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,640
can do the same thing the secondary
characters so

319
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,210
208x208 is about 78,000 selling I only
have about 78,000 plaintiffs values the

320
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,220
tractor and since yet another factor
second that or sumptin

321
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,260
and she other take under eight seconds
to do the same thing as a 4.0 research

322
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,490
are forced to so elected

323
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,660
demonstrate love someone yell out

324
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,339
up character a p

325
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:09,009
capital orders and I'll

326
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,479
capitalists that not all

327
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:21,479
for

328
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,790
ISO lives lost in a sec it's there but
so

329
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:38,790
what we're seeing here is the

330
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,860
well other stalking is explained in
certain point %uh

331
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:01,860
the single life %uh a

332
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,320
okay %uh rousing it splits and

333
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,668
8 different too much medicine is so true

334
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:13,740
this is are the result of each one so
the first one we poll

335
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,139
and for each one of these first two
characters for says

336
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:20,320
looks like we have about forty percent
saturation and

337
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,439
we get %uh a vector henri paul the value

338
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,320
and its about 3,650

339
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,360
values and got one draft each one

340
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,809
and disorder shows as it's doing the
bitwise AND

341
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,999
how it reduces the number of
possibilities so

342
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,720
single like this the first one the
ground got a second one

343
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,929
and utilize and introduces a donde
seventeen-percent

344
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,649
I'll got another one do it again I
really sit down further

345
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:53,320
another one do you know his adult
further and we end up with

346
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,860
other after that just as much a ones and
zeros and what's been up

347
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,580
up here in this area is although the
enumerated values

348
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,699
%uh just spit out everywhere there was a
one

349
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
and when we do the same thing for the
second

350
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,179
characters same thing and we just

351
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:14,929
Doolittle's nice for that too cracked
through those really quick those with

352
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:15,929
another many of them

353
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,220
%uh 72,000 and we find it pretty quick

354
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,080
you want to know %uh lawler

355
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,759
love okay that's that the dilemma here
sure this thing is %uh

356
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:36,100
sure this thing is

357
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,330
141 next but this is actually a flawed

358
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,658
just in hand in the idea exhaust brute
force

359
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,129
is your gonna do an exhaustive prefers
attack %uh

360
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:49,539
d space for the time

361
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,360
whatever's needed each time the other
characters can grow exponentially

362
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,570
and even though there's a a trade of the
exploit between storage space

363
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,269
capitation power you're still not going
to get around the fact that this

364
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,330
exponential growth

365
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,259
underpasses size which is a pain and a

366
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:13,259
using sucks

367
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,700
our the other thing is to create this

368
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,380
%uh this majors in the first place it's
gonna take just about as long as a latte

369
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,230
to perform in touch with four speeches
go through every possibility

370
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,470
in the news flippin on once every time
you see a thus pollard's was to be

371
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,350
the blood this is a one-time costs so if
you get this done once likely not I'm a

372
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,450
supercomputer

373
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,220
make some acid distillate client is
going to slow this all somewhere

374
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,450
once it's done

375
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,070
and you got this reduced file are you
can use this file to do

376
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,769
the equivalent capitation all work that
was done

377
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:54,799
that one time really quickly

378
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,289
and the other thing salt alliances a
separate

379
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:03,120
midgets for each difference although
which means that not only is the size

380
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,250
growing exponentially with respect to
you

381
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,440
the lender the password but also the
number bids

382
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,029
just result %uh through just us results
not to there's only two oldest sauce

383
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:17,200
oh yeah

384
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,690
I'll session a slight its way

385
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,039
it's just something that's thrown into
the encryption stuff

386
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,960
at the very beginning %uh that's the
best way to describe it so

387
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
basically it imagine trying

388
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,110
dad to get here plain text just printing
and that's one way to do it

389
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,889
and so this this just makes

390
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:45,620
its that the results to prevent people
from

391
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,159
just making a joke table are every day
the Sultanate's

392
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,700
so since the 12 its assault for

393
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,899
de estar passwords then it's test

394
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:01,519
actually trips to you 4,096 different
safe attacks

395
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,039
each of the units sold so UCL

396
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:10,519
that's dollars things with the students
although it is the same plant

397
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,309
so what say you enter your password you
wanna mean

398
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:17,529
test for some reason are it'll take
around salt

399
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:21,529
I'll and included using that network
it's stored

400
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,850
in the shall follow it it s really never
next time you log in

401
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:31,269
a you driving test it'll grab the first
two characters so let me take 10

402
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:34,750
and uncheck the last letters solidity
you could

403
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,519
conceivably have 1296 users all at the
same password

404
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:41,820
but almost insulting each one and

405
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,158
you don't entirely different you will
have a single

406
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:51,840
matched entry unity desert to show all
have to look different to

407
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,840
shoes

408
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,330
others love honor cherish is done by
name age is just a ones

409
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,740
yeah

410
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,440
actually asleep but I mean objects %uh

411
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,350
a six of us me its itself a

412
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,700
actually made objects for the vectors
and

413
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,740
another object for the majors sees
another one for

414
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,740
the victories and in other countries too
much

415
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,460
%uh well

416
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,510
I'll I Hollowell how much with this week
growth the age

417
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,690
character %uh it depends on how big the
sizes

418
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,050
like warehousing exercise it based on
the vision opens law

419
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,500
%uh the more saturated making major its

420
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,920
the less you should be needed on it
that's lesson

421
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,970
30 percent is statistically where you
wanna be but you can make one is too

422
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,580
small

423
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,060
any transit too much stuff in there and
get this giant metal ones which is

424
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,899
useless

425
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,870
you can't cite it as long as a john
major's

426
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,030
all like ninety percent once which is
mostly useless

427
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,010
us to hear that absent it then

428
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:22,660
%uh yet another character that's more
fun if

429
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,130
yet because it's still a

430
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:34,130
she

431
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,490
well this is actually a this isn't
related to you

432
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,470
lot sizes is the hash so

433
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,460
now she

434
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm sorry to interrupt I'll be a pup
walking around the same way

435
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,769
cannot be better you raise a hand of the
person you might solve this will

436
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,470
actually everyone will be over here

437
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:08,470
soldiers please follow

438
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,379
all related to his question are will
these men approach

439
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,700
the applicable to anything other than
that s yeah

440
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,970
md5 example is worth anything it just

441
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,909
the reason I said shoes %uh does it has

442
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:30,099
simple easy to work with stylist %uh
also it's got a small assault

443
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:34,168
all asses out there and the souls
biggest

444
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:39,769
sticking point here so you can't do this
then is closes with the law

445
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:43,369
you can actually use this anytime you
like

446
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,679
correlate %uh plain text with some soda

447
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,309
%uh has to tell you a story applications
media

448
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:54,009
tranny to it's just a tad ship I

449
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:58,549
responsible stupid but the size of the

450
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:01,989
fall crime power Nightfire

451
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:06,139
since I'm time and take you so far shins
defeats in

452
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:09,899
yeah it so does it in ninety five times
longer each time

453
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:13,580
YUM

454
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,250
it it would depend on high side

455
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,090
really like you can size it so it takes
longer

456
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,130
takes less space engine size its

457
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,559
it takes more space for takes less time
Paso

458
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,580
so that highness graphic

459
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,158
but look at the wrong time for the
actual program that uses it

460
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,480
is extremely fast %uh I yesterday with

461
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,840
Big O notation and like runtime: %uh

462
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,870
its fixed I'm into just just agreed

463
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,070
18 actors from from those files

464
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,600
just as a C red the eighties actors and
together

465
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,990
and the other %uh and transfer the
possibilities so

466
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,190
it's basically next time %uh big old

467
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,970
8 spree pretty good for disasters

468
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,149
%uh any other

469
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:10,370
questions she's haul ass

470
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,470
to what have you come up with an

471
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,600
optimal size speed size speed

472
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,809
trade-up balance other lost don't like

473
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:27,010
make one for a for six characters and
and still using the four yr

474
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,210
out there justin's largest numbers for
that most people use

475
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,100
like most people stay with the ship he
another me investment

476
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,460
and ship six characters a

477
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,840
36 possible should alert %uh

478
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,720
getting about the same time when take
but 22 news storage

479
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,750
and that's when things get into

480
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,970
to this thing tonight %uh

481
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,169
yeah I know there's a new storage
technologies coming out

482
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:04,549
but sometimes and you know if there is
some historic technology that

483
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:09,289
gives us some sort of leave ordered %uh
this could be actually pretty

484
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:14,000
football %uh but if not you know I'm
hoping that someone other than things

485
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,039
some years %uh rely on the shelf at
Fortis

486
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,908
to actually cracked passwords with
because you need assists ever table 4

487
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:23,500
each sold

488
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,690
so that is curator at twenty exit 28

489
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,780
times for those instances pixel %uh

490
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,610
I at the hotel different ways of
distributing the slate to look for in a

491
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,090
day

492
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,620
mislead of this entire thing

493
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,409
in poland actors from wherever burn not
one person was able to do this

494
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:46,860
and get some like massive tape drive

495
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,130
do all the competitions listing you
could have this giant

496
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,890
other the giant DataMatrix where

497
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,890
something simple and service you just to
it

498
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,280
be taken when it crashes it spits out
other possible values for you to check

499
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,129
return and I'll take it. capitation sir

500
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,290
it's just a great actors do the
animations

501
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:14,719
other his circular S l's arm

502
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,669
with him this information may be the
slide presentation available on the net

503
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:23,460
%uh yeah I'll try to remember to put
online your last

504
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,370
she shelter and i was just curious about
one was

505
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,460
brown when was it sturdy I guess

506
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,699
Nelson publicizing is technique %uh

507
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:40,860
she came up with this phone like I said
when I was trying to solve trends Cell

508
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,240
but I'll just recently yes

509
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,679
I don't really think it had any
applications of the slaves

510
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,730
sir Allan Asher someone I the school's

511
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,840
us should room earlier

512
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,050
this year and shirts and the kids a tour
miss you

513
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,380
to strangers a speech shores cajuns

514
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,590
said %uh anyone have any other questions

515
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:13,350
long

516
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:17,100
all about variable-length passwords very
violent that's what skelly

517
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,560
checking for through the caters well if
you want to do that

518
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,779
really just and another character

519
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,300
cue the fell further which is a blank

520
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,450
or you can create it's ever major
streets one diverts

521
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,540
size for 3

522
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,080
so you can make one for Curtis 15
characters

523
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,779
pre-sold

524
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:46,060
tried anyone and anything else

525
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:53,060
loans

526
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,570
yeah I'm just a little confused about
salts

527
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:03,130
arm we're initially creating the
password it's around and saw

528
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,570
that has a store that's all so they can

529
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,270
matchup sends a text every time right
and

530
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,950
its doors and plain text I just pippen's
it to the hash

531
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:20,169
national hashes only the red part the
salt is the party re-signed

532
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,170
yeses for their call so

533
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,140
other well wrestling you looking

534
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,350
at that you can just pick out the first
to know this

535
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,450
hash so while you know that's all yeah

536
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,470
you know that's all so why would you
have to

537
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,930
princess table for each song you're
right because you didn't know the song

538
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:43,450
because

539
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:47,340
the ramparts different result so

540
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,340
if you use if you try to crack

541
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,640
the once the test salted with GE

542
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,879
you get a table me BC ATV up

543
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,030
%uh then all this Reformation

544
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,340
will be fun to draw stuff okay soo

545
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,470
that's all like new overhead your first
P

546
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:14,050
meals but once you get past the file
trying to crack ten-years-old

547
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:21,050
Lions okay yeah yeah

548
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,310
okay you you trading of computation
power firm

549
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,029
just storage space and I understand
completely how that goes

550
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,100
but most hash functions when you changed
one bit

551
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,930
are trying to shovel as many other on
many of the outcome that's as possible

552
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,879
reso by breaking up the influence how
can you

553
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,800
story the outcomes I actually take
advantage of the fact that

554
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,990
is splitting it up and trying to defuse
all information

555
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:05,990
a think on it is a grabbers on

556
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,230
love are at the cages

557
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,070
a good explanation site for this up like
a same

558
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:19,440
is diffuses information and but there's
going to be instances where

559
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,760
sector texted are going to match up so

560
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,310
test All Souls Day tested all these for

561
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,320
haha forget a password they all have the
same

562
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,690
%uh firstly characters this said text
right

563
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,780
so you do the same thing where

564
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,990
the next three characters the next three
characters said this

565
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,560
and so

566
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,840
is going to every possible

567
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,090
was generally make slightly every
possible and S and

568
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:54,160
everywhere in rolled the enumerated
cattle ATA

569
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,100
I love where it sees the the

570
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,109
the pair teehee able to walk which is
fair excellent

571
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:05,340
escalation point capital J 21 petitioner
prayed for 21

572
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,710
petitioner eight-point for 21 it does
after all the

573
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,040
these first three that does it for the
next three and as

574
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,400
the next and then you and all those
together

575
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,440
the only places where there are still
once in

576
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,780
that's a lot for those there's a one in
every single one that's a possibility

577
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,880
for the plaintext so one see all those

578
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,070
the first chance I get to he just trial

579
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,100
said like their father yeah

580
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:40,310
the best Isco

581
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,340
from here

582
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:49,010
a said you were here certainly three
characters in January

583
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:53,480
use the major tests to determine that
that could be a possibility

584
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,680
I'll K will be possible

585
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,379
actually do that again and again and
actually forget the

586
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,119
real password the if you had enough

587
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,710
%uh alleys for because that gives me
enough

588
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,840
usefulness but you can make a fist 1061
and

589
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,210
and then all the other and eventually he
had enough are

590
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,740
be statistically probable that you would
gary that passed without

591
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,619
haha but you be wasting in storm cell

592
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:27,240
%uh basically a la suppression other %uh

593
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,490
all information put in there but if
there's a 1% already know those letters

594
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,660
other ones can be written that other so
it's all the classes on itself

595
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,230
so when you get the results I'll all
that collapsed information

596
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:44,090
kiss hopeful that I'll settles in

597
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,280
them

598
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,650
my version of the song was to see the
song was really

599
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,540
two letters in the beginning or 456 will
analyze because like

600
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,890
in this example on this is not the salsa

601
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,960
like their filers like those all
national

602
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,660
UN when you get my setup the to cracking
message to help determine how long this

603
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,350
also

604
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,839
which in the past far I

605
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,900
well this just the shit out behind the
first two characters are the salt

606
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,640
%uh so arm status

607
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,509
mean that just that's the way it is this
the way it actually is

608
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,410
day

609
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,700
my only excuse my ignorance about a

610
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,450
the algorithms but I am if you're using
different algorithms used yes here

611
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,609
it was 95 past are with the

612
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:45,100
also be producing such a sloth signature

613
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,350
beginning of a critical test yet feels
right dollars

614
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,130
yet still recognizable I mean yeah

615
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:56,140
a no one tries to us to stay with us
alters its

616
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,810
so you can always pick it out that way
and they're three details from the

617
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,480
consoles

618
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,720
right Bernard

619
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:10,430
just like

620
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,470
fish along those lines I the paper on

621
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,920
forcing several years back and

622
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,470
I suggest that for future album designs
the city

623
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,720
dropped store in seoul have a computer
check all

624
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,720
this case work today sex assaults

625
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,120
at login that way makes it hard people

626
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,900
crack later on well yeah.so

627
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:42,600
his of people Khloe is this article it
just does woods

628
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,760
except for when people are cracking
massive passive files those

629
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,180
crackles possibilities are endless I'll

630
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,450
it so home considering that this

631
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,580
techniques really only useful for
massive miles

632
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,710
%uh passwords arm have you considered
using serve us all

633
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:07,750
caching technique or some wait another
five Salt Lake compress the salsa

634
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,990
each time run through each time you try
to pass what it recognized and keep

635
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,880
track of all the songs to sing because

636
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,030
probable and well using a red out with
indigenous assaults

637
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,830
you actually get the same compression a
there's really nothing you can process

638
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,270
so you get the same usefulness

639
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,880
on making a separate table each cell as
you would for computing every possible

640
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,850
value result

641
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,380
so I just wanted to solve the equations

642
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,230
mixer won't reach one but if you're make
four thousand 06

643
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,610
these and if you make another one that
was for of

644
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:47,080
forecasters and concentrator salt %uh in
the end their sizes would be up the

645
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,830
Saints as all of us together

646
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,350
versus as this one massive I'll bus

647
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:56,080
okay but that being said that if you can
use the state needs you

648
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,190
hopefully help millions passes to try to
crack so

649
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,660
wouldn't make sense because salts for a
certain probability

650
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,290
in the past files to keep track of which
is also the end of

651
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,509
after church every table that you doing

652
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,050
well know your credit you can just look
at what's all this music

653
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:18,130
appropriate table and the salsa for the
even if she is I mean there's no

654
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,420
not that I love anyone so I'll take it
sees more than any other one so

655
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,170
yeah today into yeah

656
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:33,170
much

657
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,080
hi I'm I was just wonder if you thought
about concept that

658
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,640
sedan medical missions are more likely
than others so rather than storing

659
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,080
to to it is along the x-axis make

660
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,160
store you know either 543 for tuning

661
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,980
for the lease on March to install that
there's waited for the sister

662
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,210
doing I am still using the flow Snyder

663
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,510
just use thirty six characters long kiss
old

664
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,680
numbers since most people don't use the
ship to you

665
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,210
years %uh

666
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,580
yet you don't actually useful in sao
that in this method but

667
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:20,170
just sponsor conditions the real
usefulness thank you can get the

668
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:24,270
really hard once the dictionary files
like yet if your gonna take that

669
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,790
approach you might as well as creating
dictionary file

670
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,120
and Chantry the mall used rock

671
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:36,900
additional buses just a curiosity

672
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,450
are you aware studies at handout

673
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,950
average passer line like this or actors
56

674
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:49,140
an iPad

675
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,779
yes sis I just guess

676
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,890
right right without that neither

677
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:02,430
unclear exactly what's the

678
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,549
for just give us a sample file

679
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,790
lurches toward most files I was just
just ones and zeros

680
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:13,750
literally is just 100 A's

681
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,490
a charge and I just took my part so that

682
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,590
I can put fits in using

683
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:27,590
ship dollars so tests

684
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:34,470
her b-day

685
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,140
because that no threat

686
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,150
%uh so it literally is just

687
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,980
%uh 82 the matrices

688
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,450
one after another %uh delicious ones and
zeros

689
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,580
I know how long it's going to be so it
the file do is adjust

690
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,350
up paint strainer ones and zeros its

691
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,779
pretty much first downs fires get a

692
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,570
so yeah 18 images

693
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:09,390
ones and zeros long atop his new Rangers
plain text alongside the sandwich makers

694
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:09,730
say

695
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,790
text and there's a there's aidid

696
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:18,350
across the z-direction you not only lost
or something

697
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,569
finances thank God

698
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:26,240
there behind you are

699
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,930
underlines called is a program that does
is

700
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,930
the does what the actual cracker

701
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,570
there

702
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,130
I'll actually there's it's on see so the
other class last

703
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:55,130
its is really small actually I'll

704
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,960
I is this either right %uh sure am just

705
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,740
enumerated in Salem single values Donald
eligible that is for those experimenting

706
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,390
with different

707
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,480
under pressure %uh much

708
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,329
so just leads literally from Mama

709
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:15,579
including fifty then anagrams all these
different

710
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:19,119
here's 3 for %uh the first vector

711
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,029
perhaps an X Factor there's an X Factor
does next letter

712
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:26,309
on as measured especially spectra

713
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:29,460
%uh merges them all together

714
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,750
%uh emerged as a there was a and just
for the first

715
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,660
for second floor done

716
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,680
we figure out we take

717
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,848
we knew right possibilities and we crack
through the mall and the trial

718
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:48,839
and until we find it and only find that
we speak lol

719
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:53,269
and if we don't find it we know that
someone entered something wasn't right

720
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:54,109
because

721
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:57,569
every possible for care to pass from the
salt is JTS

722
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:01,380
in this thing song that you can find
that means it was insulting

723
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,190
was J yourself workers live a

724
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:13,190
any other persons

725
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,540
column did take it you compute the bpm
file

726
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,850
%uh like Saturday's just about as long
as it would take to

727
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,930
well do that before so this video took
about two points

728
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:32,549
but two hours to make but after it's
made it one time passed

729
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:36,420
and all that capitation is restored in
this

730
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,510
compress the whole thing he can nigga
Baghdad and one

731
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,150
so yeah said

732
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,410
the idea is you can rendell's a massive
supercomputer time to get all this

733
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,399
project Asian done ahead of time

734
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,670
and then has all stored in a file
somewhere where

735
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,790
anyone can access it for the letters get
a reduced

736
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:00,220
his face to check yes I have a question
you say about

737
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:05,500
the roomie exactly's has exactly
competition that's

738
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,530
visitors to try the crappers close
storms

739
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:14,060
yeah well I once ate yeah is God

740
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,680
the same runtime but

741
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,690
the actual competition might take part
him all rights to this

742
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:26,860
and if you don't have enough branislav
and

743
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,650
sluts gonna take so

744
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,790
questions no some

745
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:42,589
isn't done its

746
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:43,779
%ah

747
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,910
school
