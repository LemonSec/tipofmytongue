00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,770
basically a time t develop

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,980
a I'll some software

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,620
that well may got make a lot of things
possible

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,400
you Obama were possible for mines

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,450
petri dish are

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,360
his for your product home

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,370
me job of

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,170
is from Philly IMC out-of-focus

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,970
pop

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:09,820
the fed's all and I lost a lot of heart
been

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,320
working on over the course of the past I
your

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,720
you're too are just a little background
about products

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,770
a outsiders of other

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,860
are you hold up isn't internet only
radio station that was started on the

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,240
whole

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,080
National Convention involve yeah it rose
from the ashes

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,080
upgrading me was the was the pirate
radio station

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,039
I was asking about the SEC about for
years

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,660
four years ago a to the south

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,869
I'll opinion plus the and

28
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:47,720
media center people came together you to
that goes into the station

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,570
us from you well the whole washing of
philadelphia all

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,310
came to of our song RC are

31
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,520
days

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,009
year 2000 a we had such a good time
putting on valuable

33
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,780
the member station we decided just keep
it going even though

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,330
I'll are the main audience is that we
wanted to reach

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,080
were people that didn't happen puters
people to do listen to web radio

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,990
decide we're gonna find ways to
community radio I

37
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,310
and make internet radio and radio

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,390
and %ah so the we got station going

39
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,960
internet station and then me got into

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,900
up I an arrangement with the local
community station

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,060
the which was a station that was

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,220
almost about to go bankrupt

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,380
it's a its association with 25 your
history

44
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,579
and it was having no financial problems

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,780
and so we cud ideal we're and

46
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,480
and they have a really hard problem
which as it turns out

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,510
its it's a lot easier I'll

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,670
it a lot easier I learned as a pirate to
you

49
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,230
to broadcast I than it is

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,480
and a lot cheaper but of power station

51
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,299
or no 500 800 dollars of

52
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,680
it's a lot easier and cheaper abroad
about and

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,420
yeah %uh a a single I'll

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,910
a single on your screen some place to
place

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,160
reliably with high enough quality about

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,540
and regular radio stations spans you
know

57
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,790
and eighteen thousand dollars in forces
me microwave link between

58
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,040
two points and I and that was fun

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,570
the something p he was not going to be
able to do and what they had to move

60
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,570
transmit from its original site and

61
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,590
I'll and they need to separate the
studio

62
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,530
trends that are meaningful order to you
I'll yes

63
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,780
rules so army decided that

64
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,019
radio hold up I in exchange for

65
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,180
happened some of our programming go out
yeah um

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,640
about we are on the way we're going to
set of problems developing software are

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,310
about it that could create reliable
screenings females but not for

68
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,370
for a broadcasting I thirty years

69
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,660
associations line withhold with

70
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,140
Eugene computers and are without invest
in the

71
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,390
two thousand dollars Marshall all

72
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,940
are Michael so are

73
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,090
I came to that says I am I am this much
on our

74
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,240
and I made this decision about

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,950
I'll five years ago but I was not on
anything else about

76
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,930
years I was just blown away and I just
to make sure that I have friends

77
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,840
that I handle the here on the I have to
say

78
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,990
that in the course of this product I'll

79
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,770
you know people started you know
explaining

80
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,240
that you know years Microsoft Windows

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,700
did you ever hear day yes is about as
good as getting your news from ABC or

82
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,330
NBC other corporate media

83
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,520
plan when it comes down to that a the

84
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,159
what we need to do was not take the easy
solutions though

85
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,009
about phone from winning

86
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:18,870
and all that sort of thing anything into
to go until the next to be able to pass

87
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,879
the law something that that would be

88
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,680
than the right thing for for what we
needed to do

89
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,379
%ah Weedon just need something that was
capable of

90
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,849
posturing from one place to another but
I actually did

91
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,669
to our have the radial the studio and
the

92
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,960
studio both the mall to reliably

93
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,090
and are are in a regular awesome

94
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,270
are the lever streams to the transmitter
site

95
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,318
and field office so that

96
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,699
is up that's the nature of the challenge
that

97
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:59,699
faced when options are

98
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,030
you

99
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,680
that so um

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,080
bring pop project in general mom

101
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,070
boxing primarily working renewable than
PB

102
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,349
on reliably on the a review wanna

103
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,400
a project still an ongoing project very
much

104
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,400
and also the project the time relevant
open source

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,820
software package certain turnkey
solution to get me the radio on your

106
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,230
so begin by hong bao

107
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,310
the while the whole idea is to you

108
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:45,310
2009 interesting and also what's
important I

109
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,880
meetings Papa that few min early

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080
is often very important %uh because

111
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,219
us to you and Twitter can't I always be
the same occasion

112
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,520
especially Lohar gambles that seems like
a very often the case

113
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,580
it person seems like a somewhat

114
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,240
easy problem because there's a lot of
software out there that will do this

115
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,160
right you

116
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,900
download whatever on people are you
ready for the program you use

117
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,910
and you download audio of internet and
listen to it on

118
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,430
and is also offers a software that one
podium belonged

119
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,930
or and rapidly you got it turns out that
that's

120
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,640
through will be deceptively simple he
has all other pieces about

121
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,530
hostile and that being rather on a while
and

122
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,860
we've gone through a lot trial prime
fine

123
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,250
polynesian pieces are reliable another
about them as

124
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,290
of we we had very very little money

125
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,960
start with them no money no money and

126
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,500
when we damn we were using islands and
we'll go through the history

127
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,250
%uh the technical problem setting up see
13 via

128
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,100
on moon without you can spend many
thousand dollars on marshalling

129
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,610
or even regional activity ok but you
can't do that

130
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,930
comes more and more difficult when
they're actually articles

131
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,090
with me user silently pensions hmmm

132
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,830
Mother's Day Spa so the initial problem
is to get broadcast quality audio

133
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,109
from place to place using a dial-up
modem and had to be reliable enough so

134
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,510
that we wouldn't drop off your

135
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:26,320
for 30 seconds defined by the SEC okay
so

136
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,659
the the five-year deal the phone near is
about the original plan which we are

137
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,130
very

138
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,610
are on and the the plan with me a
turnkey solution the gate near a

139
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,340
decision

140
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,849
view this to you and with early on the
air something that was

141
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,560
easily installable sorry thinking like a
with Wilson the

142
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,610
the next just images something about are
something that would manage both

143
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,330
include a computer and each other
computer you you have one computer that

144
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,020
is connected directly to the studio

145
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,850
another computer connected to the
transmitter and you want the software to

146
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,840
manage both souter Beijing are something
will do content scheduling

147
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,370
the the schedule different pieces on

148
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,790
chose goes on and then there are other
pieces about

149
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,689
you want something that we means the
network because C studios on the SL

150
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,870
you may want to use that dissolve other
things or control the band with newsies

151
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,270
what software using that word in and
also something the people

152
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,819
nasty we want to see the Lincoln Center
somebody

153
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,460
never use Linux farm and put it in the
dryer was adopting

154
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,180
student works interview configurations

155
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,030
slogged thanks

156
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:46,030
we really don't wanna go

157
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:52,939
I this is where we begin the Highlands
Ranch in part one reason why we're here

158
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:53,290
is

159

me really need help on this product's
linking column I

160
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,209
indians a it's really worthwhile project
for a lot of reasons

161
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,490
on interesting story is that on

162
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,929
clean renewable to was just beginning
was during the Republican National

163
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:08,720
Convention

164
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,619
and a the last hope conference what
happened just that weekend previous

165
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:16,689
and in fact Jello Biafra spoke

166
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:19,819
he wrote that about the need for people
to get involved in

167
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,319
using technical powers for good %uh
actually came with it was one or

168
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:25,959
personal use on stage

169
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,990
on personally I've thought long and hard
about further

170
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,069
under the hot air max them information
wants to be free

171
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:36,329
my question is whether that means we're
hospital said and this is a very

172
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:37,160
practical

173
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,420
product there last were actually working
directly

174
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,089
to give the means of communication to
communities that want maybe

175
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,920
you don't like commercial radio you
don't like the way the media is

176
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,139
but you don't go out and start your own
radio show to enter your

177
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,420
people you do what you gotta rights code
over the big difference

178
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,779
you can spend an afternoon reading a
script for somebody

179
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,759
and it's something they can never do on
their own you make a huge difference in

180
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,720
their day-to-day lives

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,809
something very much easier it was the
widow

182
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:11,118
thing p

183
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:14,990
his you

184
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,110
British English distorted you think just

185
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,799
decisions Rangers

186
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,970
using

187
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,110
yes something people are you his

188
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,850
open source K together he

189
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,720
your friend about places that have heard
open source software think it's a good

190
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,250
idea

191
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,319
but have no idea where to start so we
can show in Cincy

192
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,759
set something up some audiences me
hopefully

193
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,750
cause another

194
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,639
cool thing to do is in STL is you know
so you've got

195
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,259
you want to stream audio for some reason
you transmitters somewhere in this range

196
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,730
you don't want to be traceable back to
you on ustream on the web to people

197
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,050
you want to be truthful since for the
nearest

198
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,480
problem something is quite soldier him

199
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,939
on right so I'm we need to buy

200
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:16,000
with the Indians were the meetings
including

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
through the atmosphere that the content
providers

202
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,410
are legal in publishing on the web that
opens up the possibility

203
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,939
%uh all sorts of places all over the
world rebroadcast that possible

204
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:32,189
whether the FM stations are the Harkins
decisions are hard

205
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:35,839
so wallet given transmitter might get
knocked down

206
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,209
a community project actually producing
harmed walking

207
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,720
a minute Messi oh the see as early

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,990
is in Jersey waving possible but me

209
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,750
the flexible and you might have to deal
with that restraints that you have

210
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,129
probably have them resources at the
barber higher and hands-on

211
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:57,189
on there are some interesting
possibilities

212
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:00,339
richer for which announces research
questions that

213
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,709
wanna you could actually follow-on on
for example

214
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:08,569
their is on about people in hong bao
conference the news of losers with his

215
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:12,839
called him he J which is a appeared your
system with you can use

216
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,199
this order run your own

217
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,720
right click do your own show happy to
listen to it all over

218
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,870
on the other content axes comes from
another here

219
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,579
listening to it and actually believe he
is which is hoping he did not work the

220
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,839
spa something issues we're discussing
here

221
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,970
which is it its a says certain easy to
get on the air

222
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,290
very hard keepers of the wildly up and
this

223
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,829
and the system's design me really easy
people have show

224
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:44,430
and really easy and so in traffic by
familiar great about

225
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:51,430
and some meaningful way disorder product
here is some information in real-time

226
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:55,660
think people in over those are

227
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,000
web address the clock radio 2.4 was
interesting

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
also WPTV for think that's true

229
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,200
this is the very simple plan to upgrade
me

230
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,390
we have a few stations %uh wanna one of
the interesting

231
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,650
of schools and we had to face with the
both vision is that you actually buy

232
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,760
few products ones renewable her this

233
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,990
the in the media biz Tom Brady product
in WPB which

234
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,050
has its own studio was a separate
independent radio station

235
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,530
so here we had initial concern which is
that we need to

236
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,000
switch from one haha provider to another
mean to do that on the schedule

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,470
on this is also the kind of thing the
moment use a few had

238
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,680
your own transmitter and may be
broadcasted during certain parts of my

239
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,690
you actually it shows booked for the
rest the time you wanna

240
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,800
wrong other on new tremendous mom great
on

241
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,360
on so those kinda just comes down

242
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,690
those just for you although and the BBB
and

243
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,730
it was over your cell to a central
server

244
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,210
and then the transmitter picks it up
ambassador on

245
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,700
while columns that we had originally

246
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,770
was that so I hope the locations that

247
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,970
that even even if we have the money at
the moment the paper DSL for them

248
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,440
they were on the other side the digital
divide their own neighborhoods in

249
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,280
philadelphia

250
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,990
that may not survive DSL yeah and %ah

251
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,170
it mother things that he spent a lot of
time on those

252
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,480
was dealing with the low bandwidth
issues precisely because

253
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,060
it's not uncommon for %ah style tell
want to

254
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,210
society transmit or silence two years in
place that the phone companies choose

255
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,070
not to SAR

256
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,600
a with with their with the hype and with
I'll

257
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,820
applications and our and the the other

258
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,430
problem are in a news station on the
bell

259
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,530
in maryland I'll use the same system

260
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,870
was that the only place that the SEC
will allow us to put the transmitter

261
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,920
I and and I and Khalil station

262
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,440
was on I want across the Chesapeake Bay

263
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,130
I and II me be sorta it's not our way
into getting a license for uptown

264
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,189
across the across the bay by by

265
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,980
citing the transmitter someplace that
was are an awful way

266
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,790
farm from the major cities that we were
able to get the permit for them

267
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,530
but there was definitely no other form
connectivity

268
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,150
their a tougher for by law and what we
end up using

269
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,360
a in bizarre was the fate

270
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,670
laws about the satellite connection I

271
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,170
out there a job we are still stand

272
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,610
thought to function actually wasn't even

273
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,120
Diana bias that was a local phone caller
I

274
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,400
I was miami is that the FTC's actions
were so intense that

275
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,740
for for them to be able to broadcast
their

276
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,880
signal 10 miles across the Chesapeake
Bay is necessary that

277
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,010
sender information grammar the seller
from you

278
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,160
huge no from discuss the west coast min
up into space

279
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,650
so that we do get this thing on but
miles in meters

280
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,920
interesting times problems you know that
there was one other

281
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,940
a motivating factor in very difficult or
hand deliver

282
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,580
man's man the the campus in singles that
the leading see what's up

283
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,619
straight ok second for on a

284
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,300
how to get from one place to another and
that made all the players very very

285
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,909
unhappy

286
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,520
here's the real picture for radio

287
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,080
on we don't really million reader

288
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,580
sitting close in probably not

289
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,659
the point is just that there's a lot of
pieces they're all interconnected

290
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,990
slim shows lots of random things to

291
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,520
on me maybe I'll talk a bit about a the
technical

292
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,110
what the pieces of the puzzle are on the
technical history they call us here

293
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,520
on weeee me first are moved on

294
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,280
the on the project we had the two sites
the the renewable side

295
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,840
and then he decide and there was a trend

296
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,290
and the question was how do we get this
thing on her switching

297
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,200
on concluded he was a real problem for
us first one because

298
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,300
the on this to your site in have we can
get his own

299
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,290
he wanted I'm not we have the money so
we had three dollars

300
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,470
allegations on the first thing we did
was

301
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,160
news on live up us which is a open
source and the three streams offer

302
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,830
and I'm you down she movie discovered
with

303
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,699
well-used what we discovered is that

304
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,060
I'm live us is very very unreliable on

305
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,090
it would I all the time very problematic
and

306
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,959
another problem we face is that on the
mp3 software

307
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,270
wouldn't function under we've been
broadcast under on

308
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,460
very very low a bitrate: it just
wouldn't work

309
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,460
over a modem it win the twin brother

310
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,260
mp3 on and we were forced

311
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,350
a certain point exterminator solutions
and we ended up

312
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,610

well under the delivery solutions and if
that's true then we should look into

331
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:14,980

shirted as straight

359
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,809
muscle

360
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,670
I'll he got year ago

361
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,059
to spur if you're wondering but no
difference

362
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:37,420
but a little bit mean what's me

363
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,200
24 K yes it had been

364
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,690
another interesting bad about them the
3d audio real

365
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,960
are you sounds pretty I 16 hey

366
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,830
20k I'm audiophiles Palghar

367
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,270
but for but for us it seemed OK

368
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,299
you know even listen to it on the radio
on

369
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,820
there was other distortion and so the
won the stores in the heart of you like

370
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,110
it

371
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,179
can't about the other distortion
immediately called warm

372
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,549
on but that was actually just that
certainly

373
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:13,850
continues to be a disappointment for us
and dealing with the real producer

374
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,990
has meant that we had to deal with their
player which is

375
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,820
as it on who he is really designed to be
integrated

376
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,700
into like a units up Asian 128 K

377
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:31,700
mp3's great but we can stream fortune

378
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:35,820
%uh we have we don't want to the smaller
can challenge your at home

379
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,379
on another question another issue we
have is that our

380
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:42,649
on we're using random commercial arm

381
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,789
home objective in this is not a lot of
money

382
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:50,240
on or maybe we're using our huge 11 link
and it goes up and down

383
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,869
I'm and one question we have is how to
me

384
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:57,480
actually man monitor the effect
immediately I'll

385
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,289
affect the connection seems like their
software out there

386
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,379
we've done the UN has a solution that
the how the best do that

387
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:07,730
we also were interested in switching
having more than one

388
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,730
heightened activity had a on are like
having a dialogue

389
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,710
and have your cell so that the weekend
we don't want to go down

390
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,399
point liabilities personal these two
catches one coach

391
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:22,039
is that that's a first we

392
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,669
don't want to find bed with her
transferring large files and clit

393
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:31,119
speakers are similar to so I can catch
is that when we switch sources

394
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:38,119
North Street any suggestions

395
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:48,000
shit could you come up

396
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,710
home as well as mission on Pearl Harbor
never your fancy

397
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,860
and that easily I set something up where
we're able to monitor

398
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,049
bandwidth firewall on setup

399
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:03,740
all she does for all ended with a only
kidding features over a program called

400
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,789
I filter usually use from packet
filtering

401
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:11,230
angry with his last breath analysis on
see

402
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,210
to bed with legalization as the stream
you'll also be able to use of some

403
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,169
quality and service

404
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:21,179
schools like all went down to move the
bed with other machines so that they

405
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:21,549
don't

406
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:25,139
take over the link this want to try also
just

407
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:28,610
the thing on as I again

408
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,659
which is available in both places where
the assault is and

409
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:36,070
with that over voice where you don't pay
per minute charge to the whole computer

410
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,009
so that a hundred

411
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:40,639
12k as pretty well I'll see fit you know
the thing on

412
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,549
encapsulation over you could get 64 km
three years

413
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:48,679
you know more and sure that there's

414
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,980
you can do channel bonding with bones
also along with our

415
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,200
the same place and models usually have
towards children

416
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,399
modems with yes on the hill also with
the

417
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,519
with ISDN there is there's

418
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,679
nosers you said using satellite
Nationals

419
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,480
for TCP IP traffic were on

420
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,539
if using I issues if you want

421
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:20,129
what one thing is used commonly in
radios to use it and ice-t_

422
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:23,259
National Harbor hard worker to send your

423
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:27,120
on nursing onto the satellite senator
radio stations

424
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,759
and those hard worker decir really quite
good on

425
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,840
and they run over no single with here
you know dual channel okay

426
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,289
on always quite good this is the radios
up to distribute their program

427
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:43,090
Democracy Now that's

428
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,000
no one thing without her since the

429
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,320
it over both operation and there's
thousand dollars

430
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,870
this the progressive stop

431
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,530
as a sister on dude

432
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:02,129
commented that it was that on are

433
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,490
the the switching of the

434
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,680
on the sources you're switching

435
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,720
you have to different locations send it
in to wong

436
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,050
loesser to I'm

437
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,060
retreat now we want p.m. we were going
mad that now I'm

438
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,120
you can perceive them the real audio
solution but but we are using the

439
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,700
live it's over is there I mean eyes
customers a you can

440
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,900
with with with you if you give me a few

441
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,410
in bed one is that over on

442
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,970
my experience with a tells me that

443
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,110
do you have to bring one up for another
10 are

444
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,400
you can I believe that Icecast

445
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,720
has you figured so that it doesn't drop
bombs

446
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,860
arm during their that her are

447
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,930
there is a loophole with the the higher
bill

448
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,500
nice has two you know the one with that
it wasn't using for years

449
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,300
are that the next connection

450
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,320
there's something about overrun dimples
on

451
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,800
using our horns using my officers are
posted

452
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,440
central now on be should be okay are

453
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,710
I I think there's also are

454
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,510
Icecast to has a on

455
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,910
future workplace something between
sources are

456
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,580
you pointed director certified mp3 files
from there

457
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,250
I will then a long time Mike confusing
it with another server launcher

458
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,320
cast on my home on besote explanations

459
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,389
law the only way to do is to send those
two sources in the one

460
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,050
shooter generate you know are you human
you know

461
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,879
ring her that that it's missing persons
sir with artefacts from

462
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,700
thats

463
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,460
that's pretty interesting I'm it the
this switching has been

464
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,679
on a real issue concerning of it seems
like it should be much

465
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,740
%um Demi the solution rebar

466
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,240
but I mean if we had done for these
flows unions which you can be

467
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,820
vision planning on these computers then
they could communicate back and forth in

468
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,939
accordance with sauce

469
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,090
which would also be good I'm so maybe

470
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,630
go in that direction those slightly more
complicated

471
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,940
0

472
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,090
I is gone mention that congress has come
out with new

473
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,160
armor code play for final telephone
service just dial up

474
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,880
had a lot of making out product as they
call the blue box

475
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,140
say the loss and the hair is only about
3,000 also

476
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,470
fairly reasonable price solution I

477
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,680
think and while mercial stations I'm
take care

478
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,550
is considering it for a bad they wound
up being it's a little

479
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,260
it's not the one of these big commercial
change that their chance a lil mama ha

480
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,160
station

481
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,020
and they couldn't do in our St all that
jazz is now on the way

482
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,950
teens TV on the transmitter site so well
highest yeah the trial is

483
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,780
every once in a while the ice in the end
just oz you're on the air

484
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,090
seller go to the movies is a as a backup
system

485
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,850
that him for community station might
workers still have a problem

486
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,440
leaving and I'll connection %uh all time
which phone lines really don't like that

487
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,040
was a I was actually

488
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,909
wanna things need the book that being
part of the commas and their there an

489
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,160
awful nice sounding

490
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,490
sounding function I for a lot of people
like the parts but when we asked them

491
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,230
when he said that he wanted to use it
for our first determine a lot but they

492
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,280
told us was

493
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,250
I we think there were suitable for a
backup but

494
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,360
a we on the of and we feel like our

495
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,840
they said that they felt like the
phosphor built are not alone

496
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,780
14 sound they win over he they win
dollar-something

497
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,440
but really love the design more and are
they have a lot of concerns about

498
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,960
on quality and example to america he was
%ah

499
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,660
you know especially for their are for
their playing all

500
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,410
telephone line a box is that you know

501
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,830
other know that mines gonna be sitting
in the Sun all day

502
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,409
you know there's at the that's you Anza

503
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:18,130
the up that they are going to have to
renegotiate

504
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:23,060
and you're gonna end up are every time
the line gets a little shorter or longer

505
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,570
all flatly your lined up a situation
where where to start dropouts

506
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,379
and so they couldn't happen and as such
as a solution

507
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,770
I'll not the day they disclosures from
tryna

508
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,850
but them you

509
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,700
offering is another question for people

510
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,360
it that we've been playing with wireless

511
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,470
on and everybody's been asking us about
the same her

512
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,260
its I love you from heard about it

513
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,820
with others pictures up in the city
Wireless is the key

514
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,490
there's aren't housing when he prospered
of it and

515
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,920
that actually work pretty well Kansas
you know must be

516
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,190
we're looking forward to trying it as a
twenty-percent sludge

517
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,810
about two miles mild

518
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,740
its stake in dB gain and

519
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,580
using Cisco in a while star

520
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:29,070
gave services

521
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,939
station that use the satellite with
Lakers

522
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,210
the silos yet one issue that came up

523
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,130
under the with other things that took
the reason for that leaves you with huge

524
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,200
and so again because I'm using
RealPlayer

525
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,350
on the producer because it can deal with
the blackouts really well

526
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,440
mp3 you get periods of silence in the
area where will be read the thing about

527
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,809
the boat canopy

528
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:58,730
slogging through on and meeting up with
some weird

529
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,250
in NC no question that people have ideas
about been appreciated

530
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,380
%um officer about on me

531
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,429
you promised me if you think he will be
ok claire an application

532
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,450
and when you lose the signal that %uh
the application doesn't die

533
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,890
it just stops into the question arose
how to me what's that

534
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,380
I restarted it turns out we can wats the
number children processes and be

535
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,110
dropped 25 new wasn't playing it was at
seven it was playing

536
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,320
but this seems like a and random way
keep track of the application

537
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,629
that people have views about on had a
mean it's a

538
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,970
application its design be live here me
there's

539
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,429
so

540
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,980
flowers are studio times better than
software project

541
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,030
which is a question prospects is

542
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,889
RealPlayer going

543
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:53,680
working meanwhile

544
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,810
yeah this is a quick overview code base
amidst the prohibitions not you'll

545
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,159
I'm not really involved is the things
I'm jumpin get involved with

546
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm the eventual goal is third time he
solution that we discussed in

547
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,669
on right now no arm where that is

548
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,040
isn't and even runs on the train to the
computer I'm

549
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,370
for the encoder computers we've just
been using other tools

550
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:22,259
to keep the player going on we use

551
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,649
a purpose of the law is called human
balls which is written by

552
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,759
in new Bruns the and there's a problem

553
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,990
supervising keeps the the Mina
retirement earlier

554
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,230
the New York Times The who has a
prospect a.m.

555
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,750
that the one on rather kids that they're
gone in the

556
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,050
me the in of the and SMS

557
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,460
going because a.m. X una mas will die
after

558
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,270
home in two hours and one thing you mind
will always offer packages as you work

559
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,110
really well

560
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,460
were somewhat less well after 12 hours
arm

561
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,470
or overtime and the reliable than others
I'm

562
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,540
production the the software here

563
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,570
its principal there's a communicator and
logged as an article on improving

564
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,900
on it the team in the sand particular

565
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,540
on work and where's the this commands to
switch the same offer mom made from

566
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,090
another

567
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,560
on and we have the CGI age the dirty
when you can

568
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,880
%uh switch the signal from one a station

569
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,260
the other on we also to the floor on her

570
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,570
that in certain time will automatically
send the signal switch it

571
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,160
and then we have a process injure that
there's a certain

572
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,740
on spawns laws haha this is actually
wrong with the players whether it's

573
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,240
in PG 13 or SMS or

574
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,200
the mute button have done on purpose
that and then there's

575
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,200
a little monitor the checked to make
sure this

576
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,520
name isn't essentially mentions a
because when

577
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,370
and you recently detected major the
stream is up

578
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,549
the stream goes down then you know the
ones in rows back to on the other side

579
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:06,160
need to restart there is a

580
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,509
some future the the future on is not too
much more involved we like the

581
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,380
I'm integrate the scheduler which is one
of the things that most organizations

582
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,580
need

583
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,259
on and something unique and valuable
externally weapons

584
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,220
the on you know from where you are into
the station

585
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,100
the broadcast and streams in of
musicians like

586
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,890
in our experience when big events happen
if something is going on

587
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,720
you may want to pick up on with with
with my career you don't have been home

588
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,880
using birds the

589
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,220
community broadcasts we're on there's
intensive coverage is something going on

590
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,440
tomorrow sensors

591
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,500
on the broadcast to honor station on you
also like the moon gooey

592
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,820
on so that people can exit figure and

593
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,930
there is a now you can be read by the a
little configuration file

594
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,770
which is fine jersey in 2010 the birds
really are keen

595
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:04,770
No

596
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,180
yet yeah yes questions

597
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,868
shimmy provides those through an audio
processor

598
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:26,720
which does Russian and

599
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,960
some three offices nurture that

600
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,989
the processor but yeah situations

601
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:39,500
designs heard

602
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,290
well yet for infrastructure bonds offer

603
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,540
Russian right now go up tomorrow us

604
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,700
that that is the I'm a question that

605
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,680
plea has put me for a long time which is
how to view

606
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,160
back to software Russian limiting which
is basically just like the image signal

607
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,089
processing things with you want to treat
this sound burgers our

608
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:03,520
and on but reason me up a little bit
with

609
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,670
PE and J Max measure

610
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,380
dissolves am processing applications for
the next with Miley seem like the right

611
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:10,980
thing

612
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,420
them also not for his cleared up on home

613
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,040
how the earth me take a signal and from
soundbar processes

614
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,349
and be due to a program like real user
they expect to find just something we're

615
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:25,480
get espy's in a month you

616
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,180
the keep comment on doing software
Russian

617
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,859
just so

618
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:37,240
just round some posture s the project
attack

619
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,440
same asleep right but it seems like

620
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,089
they've got this for a comprehensive
project that covers a lot of things

621
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,849
within Russian

622
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:49,760
stash we have installed

623
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,920
take a look at it Creekside this

624
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,940
we've got a bunch duster shoes

625
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,740
you're buying a nice right askin

626
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,550
Council hopefuls Russian I think they
also saw

627
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,579
apartment on SourceForge which is

628
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,900
area loopback device for slashed its
last year's

629
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,010
p so there's a possibility have

630
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,380
thinking for

631
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,079
you know neighbors know the power to for

632
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,530
it seems like we're getting to the point
where that may be possible one please

633
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,950
it's not possible right on

634
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,730
and cover parlance my friends to

635
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,869
the we wonder if you

636
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:40,480
are just trying to 43 on as a player

637
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,720
as you to control on

638
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,670
II I have on great animosity towards in
bd10

639
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,000
I it was believe I'm unreliable

640
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,020
on it a couple things and I think he may
have to do this because it's

641
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,690
wasn't happy with his password on I had
experiences

642
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:03,170
good misfire and we pick up with the
side that with the wrong

643
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,500
bitrate: would also die on me it's in
point

644
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,650
so I found to be the one to three
unreliable

645
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,170
couple different ways book and within
that having been

646
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,859
them you see the like in the bro we had
to open up

647
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:20,400
ABC 123 and read what it was but using a
standard

648
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,710
and the green with the woods where with

649
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:29,569
I'm really but it said it was doing to
make sure that that it was doing so

650
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:32,869
on nuclear I was I'm very disappointed
with our

651
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,770
and SMS it seems better and more
reliable but again

652
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,940
but then it's hard because I can't read
from doing

653
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,430
is so this is a ugly I want to call me
making up for that

654
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:49,109
is something million open for protect is
very difficult project billion

655
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:52,390
as over me so means a woman must make
the call

656
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,520
some de hacer the great but not
realistic but will give you candy

657
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,839
do you live again but but someone
hacking

658
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,259
I'm and PG 13 3 a.m. s MMS

659
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,609
you little bit better bokram or I'm to
integrate some the

660
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:11,700
needed more liable for production is not
such a huge project

661
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,450
something we'll see about the

662
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,089
months of work Russian audio processing
we've been told that if we can come up

663
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:19,470
with

664
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,609
Prada concern company in South thousands
of dollars that many different people

665
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,220
rokar there's a huge demand for thats

666
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,349
princess files want or harm which is

667
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:36,670
with Daemon Tools that some around like
that but it sounds like it's a

668
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,829
it's doing well prosper press us awesome

669
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:43,960
digital's return various things like
that I was wondering if acid Hazare

670
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,329
you to sleep up the whole you know
crossover scripted handle

671
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,380
your two sources file

672
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,200
you know accepting stock

673
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,020
actions you know have some you know 8020
8021

674
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,339
from two streams are and then it which
is server

675
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,790
mitigate which one is scheduled to be
the Christian at that time

676
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,930
generate a third out Street just a
little

677
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,169
sheen its that's doing the the play

678
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,630
more stunning home actual the scenes

679
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,890
would be that it that seems like I did
when I first thought you would be able

680
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:21,549
to do

681
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,579
the problem is that we have to use

682
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:28,700
players mingled with mpg 123 or
something like taking the mp3

683
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,020
Higgins refugee used one hour on

684
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,180
I don't quite know have you ought to be
directing

685
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,940
with the lube absolute backs of martin
O'Malley herpes imaginary sound cards

686
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,440
and put things in wanna

687
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,980
another or something maybe he might be
willing to do that for something like

688
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,470
your bio it's a lot harder his you need
to actually

689
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:53,630
run the tool applications you that we
don't have access to live a good so

690
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,640
we have to run the we'll play it by ear
on

691
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,879
and Zoning be madness on hard maybe

692
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,540
pointed out thank you it was going to
let alone

693
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,970
absolutely planning on getting some here
today when a monster

694
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,670
fund about this and will cram as many
more slides moving to

695
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,720
%uh yet what one comment is on be

696
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,950
as John user is using you're really
thinking about

697
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,570
and we're learning has been going and
someone is something there an exciting

698
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:26,140
just stop like the p/e software is for
your data

699
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,180
which is basically a on and people to
begin music know about these things but

700
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,850
be fun right now and you basically are

701
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,870
like rock look at the graphical on

702
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,460
thing that represents a lovely bomb to
all your components

703
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,220
put together under back so no on
research products if you wanna

704
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,600
anything over there that table and if
you wanna he's from Harbor

705
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,930
losses give us your email address is
being addressed in this game email about

706
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,080
on other on our story click

707
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,660
notable G s by but basically what the
developers

708
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,940
thats offers 30 good friend of mine

709
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,310
and unfortunately because he is a member
of a

710
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,790
art alert here actually he

711
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,380
that's all for the local differ market

Josh

714
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,220
and as a result this really
broadcast-quality

715
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,300
was this slow release see

716
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,710
the moment the 40 for sale

717
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,700

720
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:48,390
1x comes her that is a lot that is very
very true

721
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,470
PE is ate something bizarre backs

722
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,870
she's worked in st. xoxo mpd seems a
little more practical

723
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,120
for use but I don't know if it's really
up for the production halt

724
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,420
yet you but he seems like the way to go
as opposed to the max

725
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:09,420
or something this has actually

726
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,000
sorry can't hear you at all could you
look up to the mike kindly please

727
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,030
he he Hughes is fighting that ms PU

728
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,160
commercial from do tonight genetic and
others

729
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,549
product people so get some quick slides

730
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,550
so he knows some pearl and you want to
get involved

731
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,530
under all sorts a small little products
YouTube very very helpful

732
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:40,130
on on and so preamble here is a happy
medium

733
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,170
a hospital profile them on no

734
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,760
this line here is where we open the
command would be the command to start a

735
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,430
player

736
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,450
and they're all hope at the end that
means that I'm

737
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:54,660
there that filehandle read from a file
handle and you can get whatever its

738
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,509
cock pumping out so for example amid
fear opening ABC 123 week agreed

739
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:03,340
the the lines coming from ABC 123 and
make sure that

740
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,950
says its it thanks to Stream is that
really is on

741
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,510
so if you download our software I'm
flown the dash

742
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,320
STL thoughts or sports that I'm you'll
see that

743
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,940
in the process manager and the lotto
it's only getting

744
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:22,020
take a look at it understand it
effectively I'm

745
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,610
the here's a scary I'm I'm

746
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,630
okay this is a scary %uh

747
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:33,130
clothes live but that's another serious
system it's tough I'll handle it means

748
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,260
that you try me from it

749
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,770
it won't be there forever on the nixon
non-blocking socket of the scariest

750
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,520
thing

751
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,020
the whole code now you've seen it you
don't be scared to

752
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,780
there's so there's a breeze

753
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,020
do that again %uh there's a there's some
but a pro questions that

754
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,840
are interesting to me down have the
answers to so for example

755
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,650
I'm release to walk to make sure that
the players actually going

756
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,940
we knew some third kinda I'm a
brute-force processed have been

757
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,340
there might be better ways to do it and
certainly more portable ways of doing it

758
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:08,810
since

759
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,980
I'm I doubt that this would work on
FreeBSD

760
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,880
certainly wouldn't work under Windows
and we've had people really would like

761
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,120
to work under Windows

762
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,330
them we don't care so I'm

763
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,450
the example if you once the process is
there

764
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:27,430
we just look in that process under the
next is a directory in that directory

765
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,000
as informational milestones processing
actually chapters

766
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,600
on that I don't think that's the thing
to do that her been doing

767
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,160
and then there's the real issue like
seeing whether becoming before about

768
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,940
seeing whether

769
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,050
the RealPlayer players actually play I'm
I'm

770
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:46,330
I I can even post but look at the new
Reseller we have to run things that will

771
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:46,860
play

772
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,760
inner X virtual barber for the imaginary
graphical interface

773
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,570
