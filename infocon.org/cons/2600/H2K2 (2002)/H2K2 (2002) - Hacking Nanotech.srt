00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,650
me

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,880
your spine different to care

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,880
country think theater

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,759
Twitter in an hour I have no idea

5
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:33,220
up and it was good

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,220
G-forces media centers world

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,940
okay we're going to get started %uh

8
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,869
my name is Jen a handle on the right
when he says

9
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,909
a really actor for sale just just
starting out

10
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,680
I want to college

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
got a two-year degree

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,259
that occasion technology loves doing
that I discovered acting

13
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:30,440
and I like her the thirst

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,759
learn to to my studies its

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,630
the morning a job but

16
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,009
yes the into this presentation is
hacking at all

17
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:46,409
all I'll not at all worried about that

18
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,430
because first hit so hard

19
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,820
and giving the speech on

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,600
I graduated and in 2000

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,110
assesses Reina evocation technology I
was the first inning

22
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,280
I nations graduates 3 I'll

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,880
from what I know now I believe remains
the only state where you can get that

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,700
and through penn State is the only
University

25
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,950
actually get is a is a brand new program
there are seven people in my class

26
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,950
all K case three semesters at

27
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,100
this Press okay that will on

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,519
there are seven people in my class we
took three semesters

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,990
a electronics classes a basic physics
class a physics chemistry class

30
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,330
all we were supposed to take the bio but
whatever

31
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,770
not that so

32
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,410
nanofabrication right now present their
first mostly to

33
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,549
microfabrication where a the building at
sea views

34
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,770
soaking based technology so

35
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,500
how many people have never even heard
the word government okay

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,020
I'll third for those who might not have
heard nada is they are

37
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,770
leanza Latin Pittsford

38
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,340
a small tends to the Naked Mile

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,690
Michael weekend -6 microprocessors I
attended -9

40
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,520
$1 billion

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,920
so an immediate is the unit that we're
talking about here

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,130
1 billionth me a regular meters thick
might have

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,109
thousand I millimeters anatomy is that
what happened one

44
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,680
billion markings

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,360
so on the take up on this trying really
what

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,420
billion days cuz that's real hard
concept for

47
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,700
people to grass sometimes just how big
money-making places just putting

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,090
making things

49
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,520
human hair processing hairs that in

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,490
thousand others %uh agrees saying

51
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,230
is to her the 2008 is across and

52
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,650
we build transistors that 130 and here's
why

53
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,270
cell we can build hundreds

54
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,990
%uh transistors inside single piece said
simple gravesend

55
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,590
bill entire circuits on process him had

56
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,959
not present-day that's what's in a name
Poor's

57
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,930
Halloween any entries and fatherland

58
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,610
missile stuff like that

59
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,910
now 130 million transistors are

60
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,280
thats I'll there exist a a

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,530
gap production research research iDEN

62
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,730
sorry develop the single-electron
transistor

63
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,110
easy

64
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,220
turns localized oxidation its

65
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,819
it's on the idea dot com slash research
month check that out the

66
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,699
little tutorial that stuff that's one
and I'll

67
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,780
is and -9 its bill

68
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,870
things that are very small when we can
build devices that small

69
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,360
you don't have to let herself just
transistors we can build anything

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,379
weekend movie channel

71
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,919
piece of glass that is hundred-man
here's why and then

72
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,690
use separation to

73
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,259
to get DNA structures leaking week

74
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,770
doom chemical reactions very

75
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,779
dangerous possible chemicals alcohol
testing

76
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,069
we waz 20 milliliters dangerously

77
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,449
with twenty millions an extremely
precious sure

78
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:38,659
person sees we can do it withdrawal
model years

79
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,029
tears we save money and

80
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:47,589
there's less ways yeah fabrication and
microfabrication

81
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:52,479
Michael have occasion first top-down
technology

82
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,460
top-down manufacturing week a substance

83
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,680
and whittle away we have what we want I

84
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,110
down she this is offense cut a tree down

85
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,949
three foot diameter tree and we will
await tree into we have

86
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,149
material for has nuts

87
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:16,779
that's just plain happening fans now

88
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,879
technologies bottom-up I G I'll

89
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,129
that technology will enable us to take
carbon atoms

90
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,829
and don't pencil carbs we will arrange
the hydrogen carbon atoms

91
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:34,159
to disable would and bill cancel that
formal definition

92
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,299
that technology is inability to
manufacture

93
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:41,899
objects and structures with atomic
precision literally

94
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,159
moving Adam Beyer on

95
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:49,319
bad that's a bit grand a definition but
that's what it is

96
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,550
are we at that stage right now I

97
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,830
not exactly sauna total short historia

98
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,490
how the salt star I 1959

99
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,499
engine failing Road

100
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:05,550
piece follows when you look at the
bottom Marie connects small

101
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,340
technology with he said something more
to do with writing

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,499
home loans he is small areas he
predicted Monday that we would be able

103
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:15,069
to

104
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,400
movie Adam place other at its next
meeting

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,629
things very small as small as we can go

106
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:26,870
1962 he will develop the first bands

107
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,900
it was a pressure sensor man whose is

108
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,050
microelectromechanical system on

109
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,479
Manzar really Nadal but I'll that
feeling and

110
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,599
fact that they're still call the the
things that may have heard about the

111
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,779
Nana laws and stuff like that I men's
allows us to make devices

112
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,650
using on this strategies along

113
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,889
ish major players thing

114
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,469
building stuff for the on forces between
molecules nineteen seventies

115
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:02,270
the right spot again research into the
the first men's

116
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,020
it now stands for old things home

117
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,289
I believe today can publish it uses
nanotechnology

118
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,399
to force a small bottle

119
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,099
air push the small thought on the paper
that other able to get such

120
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,729
precise its on that

121
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:24,719
1981

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,650
are skinny following a microscope was

123
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,089
was bill 1986 pump force microscope this
bill

124
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,930
I it's also called scan was like this
I'll

125
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,399
on talk a little later about the a.m. on
was my first I'll

126
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,839
what does is it measures policy on the
service by

127
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,290
driving ultra-fine needle across the
surface

128
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,510
all so and it's not like that record
which

129
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,589
which will vibrate its it's a it's a
single direction

130
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,110
needle cell or drag it across here Intel

131
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,270
and mister that in 1990

132
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,300
your field optical microscope was
developed that

133
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,600
greatly enhance our ability lookit
smaller and smaller things

134
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,149
are believed to see larger molecules

135
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,390
that and that was service and 99

136
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,220
twelve years ago mom yeah

137
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,560
other that preferences time on 22

138
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,709
cell I don't get any jokes about wanting
me

139
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:36,040
since I'll

140
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,589
higher than that it is without the 1991
I

141
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:43,110
by CEO gmail this then little bit

142
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,240
confusion when I was researching see
actually

143
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,670
credit personality party

144
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,560
personalities a you mentioned take a
chain link fence

145
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,740
made at home in Adams the bullet

146
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,860
on themselves that structure has been
the strongest structure known to man so

147
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,570
that blows anything that any

148
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,700
water hard metal tunes

149
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,770
are the going to be the revolutionary

150
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,189
that technology was Lee are you want

151
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,070
have control over Parliament will be
able to

152
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,440
building and everything be able to build
things ultralight ultra-strong

153
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,620
offer flexible ever pass that

154
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,470
law yet like fast

155
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,250
bucky balls thats bucky balls short

156
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,300
buckminster

157
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,120
or

158
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,880
yeah buttons affording on as the leads
in ninety-six

159
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,010
also said usual develop home

160
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,459
looks like I'll it is the third former

161
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,970
part formally

162
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,220
they only thought sexy to partisanship

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,220
right by

164
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,760
1982 a man by the name care wetzel

165
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,890
got their care that's it the Reds a call

166
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,910
a nanosystems it was

167
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,689
the first time that anyone really start
the book contains words

168
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,209
hey maybe we should be doing some
research into this so

169
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:28,480
he wrote a book called systems outlines
much

170
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,390
theory client what are we gonna have to
do what he pleases

171
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,089
course a go back

172
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,490
said

173
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,390
and courses in menswear really

174
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,410
and dollars in bad more

175
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,860
up a no a bill things 1999 to 2001

176
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,640
mighty bill

177
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,840
a gas turbine engine this engine was a
size

178
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,220
done three millimeters thick once in a
while

179
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,850
1.2 million rpm so

180
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,350
gas turbine engine size US-style

181
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,710
it was made using all the technologies
that

182
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,090
any entries me so it's not real real
super sophisticated

183
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:20,090
apology was just a different approach to
it song about the Drexel because

184
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,750
he writes a lot of material he's got

185
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,470
a lot of the Seas and books I'll systems

186
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,370
possible foresight a or and look up

187
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,660
on that in the future its online book
its

188
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,319
like month to month eighties all it it
gives the disc is written +91

189
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,360
and future in in

190
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,850
gives a description what the future may
be like for human beings

191
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,339
once technology becomes mainstream more
11 along with Val

192
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,700
I'll is the part where I start to tell
you about robots

193
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,750
with viruses on the smallest things that
we know

194
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,670
are very self me structure that allows

195
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,680
replicate themselves

196
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,380
other things like that well robots are
smaller buyers

197
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,580
makin seek out and destroy no buyers

198
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,200
file by just destroying it home bonds
between

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,520
the DNA levels thing together same with
Kansas

200
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,090
human blood cells 10,000 leaders across
well

201
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,530
we're building for building

202
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,550
devices that are 130 and

203
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,020
this weekend we can build other devices
that are even smaller

204
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,579
actually the stripclub about blood cells
repair

205
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,750
blood cells

206
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,690
this nanotechnology has been slated as
being able to make

207
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,100
the frozen head think true people had
their heads

208
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,410
Friday the frozen

209
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,000
southern anything froze such as the
problem

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,720
or expanding cell bursting this person's
soul

211
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,730
then technology I allow the

212
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,829
reason Malaysian the cell walls people
may be able to be

213
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,270
to be frozen for anymore

214
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,079
years well there's more research into
using

215
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,510
technology to recent nerve cells

216
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,780
so that way hatreds possible these are
some crazy

217
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,959
ideas that people love but if you go out
there

218
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,970
you look at the technical that you'll be
able to find out K

219
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,200
not just making transistors wounds crazy
stuff

220
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,040
home so moving back to me

221
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,639
on force microscope

222
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,569
is part now right that's not what we can
do as far as

223
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:44,089
nanotechnology ultimate goal that we
will realize

224
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,809
maybe I mother realize

225
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:51,618
office at the time

226
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:56,830
force microscope drags needle process

227
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,870
that needle is ultra-fine become

228
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,840
molecules why

229
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,850
they discovered by building the lot of
different materials

230
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,490
I'll get to the charges different
abilities

231
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,610
rather adults or

232
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:19,140
p.m. push other at iDEN has anybody ever
seen the picture the IBM logo

233
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,490
looks like 37 balls closer

234
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,540
as urs enough us again using on

235
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,000
force microscope to drag her does not

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,510
passes substrate alignments fellow yeah

237
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,569
world's smallest local home

238
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:41,989
treatments so that's one thing like that

239
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:46,629
said the single-electron transistors
awesome idea day

240
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,139
I mentioned before about how to control
with nettles for the last

241
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:55,329
for the weekend most russians I am also
has more work on their side

242
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,860
about Nichole and tunes

243
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,790
are that been able to defend circles

244
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,589
that public get rain what kinds of crazy
stuff

245
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:13,590
using me on for smokers yeah I think
there is any questions

246
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,490
that is exactly two months and now go
ahead and just

247
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:23,800
not say that on on getting close to a
section where field

248
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,810
even predictions other a bigger the
needles

249
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,240
on the atomic force microscope arm
visited

250
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,090
I only been able to find some that whole

251
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,450
just ultraviolet are 55 views but I know
about that I would say

252
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,070
on the Rangers anything any news or
something even smaller than

253
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,930
because I keep saying animators that
I've got a mention

254
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,360
you National College nations but with
the

255
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,850
hydrogen notations

256
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,650
said building transistors that 13

257
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,168
homes wall

258
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:07,730
on

259
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,419
technology today is being used in things

260
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:16,260
like smart band-aids I'll be able to
tell one

261
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:21,270
texan I'm sorry alone has been detected

262
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,480
the NHS actually makes teenagers

263
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,199
today where they can do the separation

264
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,340
decision okay

265
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,059
Michael reactors doing dangerous
chemical reactions

266
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:42,059
person

267
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,640
are they feel the think that's about
half the size and

268
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,710
these parts and it has a

269
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,100
I don't see one they won't let me have
there

270
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,260
there for sale you can get like
twenty-five dollars yes

271
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,980
actually production made 16 wells

272
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,539
where you can add chemicals blood

273
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:09,629
it will has underneath the bottom of the
actual substrate the nanotechnology

274
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,440
device ball is I'll say about the size
of a quarter

275
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,100
and have channels instances so class

276
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,840
something darkside these channels they
can't separate

277
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,539
the blood in the axes ET's

278
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,890
chips thence let into

279
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,690
customized computer

280
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:37,690
stalled crap electronics photo

281
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,790
what what do the chips do with the DNA
are the psychologist so sleepy

282
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,889
PGs US's social

283
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,360
his instincts a see

284
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,020
think sequencer this is DNA sequencing
or

285
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,260
replication are yeah he's not a

286
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,150
replication sissy sign my personal
background is

287
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,590
electronics it's on Trulia by said tried

288
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,820
I'll college get so

289
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,179
dance yet the DNA the natives are
actually out there but that's when I

290
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,770
think like 30 bucks search

291
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,550
and it's it's mostly last they're
actually I don't think they're actually

292
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,129
political contacts any I can't see DNA
and on

293
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,950
hitches to just a close associate of

294
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,340
for Salam pros go to this such as

295
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:45,760
featured scientific information plaster
delores

296
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,420
for researchers decisions

297
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,110
do you need

298
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,880
seasons

299
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,059
was its Paul

300
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,700
in I when I get to the next section
which is hacking at

301
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,680
the actual a the actual happened

302
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,380
this technology by people like us people

303
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,200
the scientist I'll DNA

304
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,660
DNA comes a scary issue because like I
said we can moan seen on at 10

305
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,660
the thing that makes a DNA is anyway so
easy

306
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,840
hydrogen different bonds hired we can
build

307
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,959
home someone a job for straying into

308
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,960
hacking that what what exactly is
hacking

309
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,290
what can what can we do to get ball Paul

310
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,500
by show of hands it has an atomic force
microscope

311
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,170
home

312
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:47,370
into mines the ninth all yeah honey

313
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,770
atomic force microscope isn't something
that

314
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,850
was given from by all could you explain
why it's the timer

315
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,850
what's called it on course my personal
uses that also find little

316
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,940
and I'll the forces a the

317
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,350
logical forces protons and electrons

318
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,590
to to do that that treats

319
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,649
one when the needle hit a bomb it's
actually not getting

320
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,420
physical bomb it's the push fine forts

321
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,720
so its it is also called skinny

322
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,930
force my first is all

323
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,160
that were actually see make more sense
all

324
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,410
like when you drag similar problem areas

325
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,910
it's a little like a record player but
I'll drive across

326
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,120
and at the mount a train

327
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,660
and record movement with the Court's
first

328
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,720
like record but I this report movement
with with

329
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,790
electrical charge so when needle passes
across

330
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,870
a large molecule

331
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,690
like say unlike alcohol

332
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,890
mom I'll fancy something it would

333
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,430
it would trace the outline things and

334
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,580
he's using

335
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,030
little so it is very closely related to
electrons

336
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,240
and anybody interested in getting
internet must take some

337
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,500
transfers lol to learn where

338
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,860
coming from how a real get down to this:
and then

339
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,410
while you're in there you might as well
take some more chemistry classes

340
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,410
since more bylaws biology classes home

341
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,730
hacking into

342
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,760
looking working passes for us to have on

343
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,129
was like this girl almost next the

344
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,230
mothers may be sign something that you K
bolger

345
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,200
thats far-out thought of it like two
days ago

346
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,500
so if you wanna you wanna this fiber hi

347
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,780
you here can but legit what everyone the
ok and it is working on a

348
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,940
up father

349
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,369
projects involving DNA plane you feel it
sampling use

350
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:05,490
in in 2000 actual print out the secrets
the

351
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,440
it make analyzing

352
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,419
from the database stuff much manzi

353
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,490
that's good

354
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,470
so looking computer hackers do you get

355
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,650
get out there done that researches I had

356
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,289
access teen equipment because I roamed a
hollow

357
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:31,770
program to get out there fine fine what
college institutions will let you

358
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,039
but you arm meaning yet the social
engineering

359
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,919
social engineer Lansing I am such
insight from

360
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,490
something

361
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,750
research user but national national

362
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,090
and evocation uses network and

363
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,840
some level poisoned

364
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,889
answer by just a slap paper

365
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,380
but Wednesday's 18 wheeler 90 homes

366
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,260
has and that are some California with me

367
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,950
so you can actually get in there and get
out get your hands on this technology

368
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,310
but

369
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,750
right now working on inside

370
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,530
simulation software somebody may want a
bill that the bodies

371
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,480
on the center which will manipulate
Adams where they want even building more

372
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,220
settlers

373
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,410
and that technology B-eighteen build
anything anyone

374
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,730
will bass if you do Sol

375
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,870
the research shows that among other
things columns presence can

376
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,010
done a lot of stuff on socio I wasn't
for hardcore

377
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,440
technical data about means that the
second

378
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,670
stuff like that stuff about upheaval

379
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,150
the social system that we have in the
world cases decentralize

380
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,350
manufacturing anyone can build

381
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,570
seller then they can do anything wall so
what's the point

382
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,169
got on the tens and who has the
knowledge miss the power

383
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,550
december's that control production and
that's all

384
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:07,080
ascribed dress lookbook I I feel kinda
bad feeling about the say

385
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,590
to you greens guys stands stuff

386
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,600
is work is in is a hundred percent
factual

387
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,700
yeah daydreams and and yes gets little
randomly

388
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,060
does he rates for from the I'll this

389
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,190
right for people like us

390
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,870
who researches work and

391
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,860
part

392
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,170
he writes for the housewife whose Hong
Kong I'll

393
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,670
01 metal awesome turning everything the
pageant other

394
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,150
lots until the apocalypse the great new

395
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,530
problem that's more

396
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,070
keywords doesn't do research on nine
grain

397
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,929
blue great who is public politics

398
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,530
well I'll the development a nettlesome

399
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,040
program to design other than December's
those

400
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,889
abound

401
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,020
turns every and higher into into

402
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,908
other names

403
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:11,460
this effectively killing on the blue

404
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,849
is a is supposed to be

405
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:18,539
check this we design at a loss program
to see

406
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,908
and destroy are self-replicating at a
loss

407
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:26,649
so we unleash a a certain number

408
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:31,320
blue lou has a lot size the world and

409
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,710
if something happens a lot something
goes wrong

410
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,899
ratings stars people blue long the

411
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:42,590
and deal to sell things home for sale is
it in

412
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,259
also is developing

413
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:47,830
see some rules

414
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,730
ethical rules don't design robots that
can function of

415
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,179
I'll really easier available resources

416
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,960
bill vitamins combines

417
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,100
as urs source fuel thinking on

418
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,649
take apart this molecule which doesn't
care naturally

419
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:10,610
so something wonderful wrong the
localized problem

420
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,769
so the people who were

421
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,919
worsening thinking this the he better
software because

422
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,399
they might be want this

423
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,720
not really softens

424
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,759
per se so they might need some software
that that allows and

425
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,480
to simulate on force microscope home
father yet but

426
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,470
where it is that there is software
available simulate

427
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,529
atomic force microscope said absolute
the software

428
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:42,709
well

429
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:45,579
and ride since the lines across whatever

430
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:48,918
for the next to each other and see if
they bounce away they stay

431
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,950
or builder the grain saw

432
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,330
sodium fluoride just puts on an exit for
me

433
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,510
so that's what we can do another

434
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:07,090
less advisable me is equipment that

435
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,910
processes these things like chemical
vapor deposition tools

436
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:17,050
although major tools make policy
equipment personally

437
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,590
I found out that they Ron their
computers running Shin

438
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,700
the no surprise but the surprises run

439
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,280
operating systems like Windows 3.1 and
dos

440
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,570
for senses itself have fun

441
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,679
and I'll what you sleep and

442
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,390
big expensive his putting be one
connected to the network

443
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,430
on speak the system months both ways

444
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,550
thing research just

445
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,210
security warning people

446
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,840
there windows 3.1 system running force
microscope a little bit more secure

447
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,510
because it people like us

448
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,980
out there it

449
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,100
all the answers rather his will find if
you can't find an answer that you need

450
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,670
to make

451
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,690
your your idea word make it up

452
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,150
ticket and ticket to adoption persons

453
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,900
hey this is what I think sanibel fines
this is what I think

454
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,140
and they'll be able to bounce ideas off
the

455
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,610
stand on but sites

456
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,369
and Central Park lot there that a whirl
thoughtful home

457
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:28,830
nada love that textile or

458
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,869
so

459
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:35,210
there's not as much information on on

460
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,769
Google is there's nothing 10 deformation
fun without

461
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,850
and technology

462
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,730
and if anyone's going to do a Google
search

463
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,450
nanotech is one word spoke referee

464
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,950
also any questions about technology
about what we can do

465
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,070
what this might mean anybody just as my
DS

466
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,550
this one trial just not to the liking
for selected thank you for speaking

467
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,379
today's

468
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,690
subject that you don't see a whole lot
about on

469
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,990
mainstream on legislative

470
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,980
encourage everybody here to due to pain
research on an attack

471
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,300
and hopefully get a bottle knowledge
created and

472
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,270
its assigns making on as far as
advancing the science will quit

473
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,879
other conventional doctor love forsake
me the recommendation that to avoid

474
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,640
apocalyptic scenarios

475
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,610
and and

476
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,880
terrorism my one country Alex

477
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,970
no buses taking this is a lil about
their

478
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,279
all they recommend as fast as we can

479
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:46,470
global information global education

480
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,669
although their problems conspiracy
theories about the government's

481
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:50,450
controlling

482
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,520
certain discoveries being released to
the public I just got

483
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,559
my its next job is educating middle
school and elementary students about

484
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,910
City an hour for college so my work
performance can be

485
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,929
immediately Valley because role sampling

486
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:12,299
technology rather program when I go out
and speak

487
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,220
so foresight has made the recommendation
we get this word

488
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,730
say this is what it is like an open
sourced

489
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,659
from

490
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:29,270
she technology easy me today

491
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,950
pins and how you apply on wants to stop
people from using

492
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,570
this new technologies this speak

493
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,039
government Weber from replicating

494
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,809
I'll intense eating

495
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:49,610
kim's all another

496
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,789
another I'll recent discovery that
you're eighty thousand while

497
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,620
they develop

498
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,070
they discover that take that certain way
for and

499
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:03,189
30 including nitride sciences then tried
cuties

500
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,620
diamonds Skype book in space that's
important popular

501
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,640
there is video out there I display this
way

502
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,720
I think I'll pass a little character pop
ballads

503
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,430
its potency king

504
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,920
rockets this some crazy words that

505
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,120
thing with some soaking up who's

506
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,110
stop somebody from designing

507
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,030
national ID system but not tell me that
they put a little

508
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,629
littles fathers and their explosion that

509
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,870
thing usually use young people who are
yet

510
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,040
person so what's the stock

511
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,540
what's going to stop people up for sale
is made the recommendation that the

512
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,799
we educate home maybe if we tell
everybody

513
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,510
don't do this maybe they won't maybe if
we give people the technology we can

514
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:57,900
bring

515
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,220
third world countries up the ski not
give them

516
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,740
money cars give them food uses and
where's the bill

517
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:11,740
who use the technology to to try and
make the world a better place

518
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,130
thinking

519
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:17,600
this that technology is going to
revolutionize the way

520
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,620
think are

521
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,710
more practical haha law haha think we
are

522
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:29,870
building what I mean difficult abilities

523
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,690
thousand-dollar amateur of time for a
how long till

524
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,900
this technology might make it into our
veterans and Hodges

525
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,490
or by trunk but one mother now what's
the biggest

526
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,460
loophole with with with heart

527
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,700
us all body immediately rule on the
backend systems and

528
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,610
men's power source yet yeah

529
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,499
alone but its but its dual all

530
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:02,779
not not lot less you on those million

531
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,200
Titans the

532
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,149
these invest of

533
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:12,060
is somebody else's and they might

534
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,460
my water one which years

535
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,409
get I really don't think government

536
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:22,520
a lot so that they don't get around do
you think that there's a

537
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,730
away to start to approach those things

538
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,629
in the bathroom research it even open
possible years

539
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,029
even the social calamity a making of

540
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,510
thoroughly track top it what if you
wanna

541
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,819
do your own personal research on this
and you get to a point where he thinks

542
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:43,319
got something go to somebody all don't
go to

543
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:46,719
got a question of people like somebody

544
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,919
doctor go to go to the actual scientists
working his

545
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,629
but try and talk to them postpone hey
this is my

546
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:56,639
is it my help his idea and

547
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,880
and we're building that tool box the
places we've got what

548
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,940
meals I'll and

549
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,870
just

550
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,620
also Donna I'll bar

551
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,130
cast members tony is out there people

552
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,290
this rates I just heard from

553
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:20,130
the other which say that like you're the
expert huge expenses

554
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,570
really revolutionize the world I was
most concerned with it being

555
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,500
lockdown up larger by the government

556
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,130
it's these patrols for trough to me as
net acres

557
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:35,740
like the assembler nightmare everybody
having their own isn't so much the night

558
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,320
yeah i like it so much he told me as it
is a dystopia

559
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,080
so i think thats yes knowledge is
definitely a place where

560
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,500
amateurism should be developed in foster
because

561
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,750
as much chaos is it as it could bring I

562
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,510
it's just as bad sub-par totally
divorced

563
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,990
yeah we that we can't let government
control the development of this

564
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,890
technology

565
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,620
I had people figuring out stuff on their
own because if we don't think they're

566
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,759
not the government's lot

567
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,170
house so we have to have

568
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,380
people doing their own research bring me

569
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,930
time for to their it maybe in the next
30 years that might be a possibility

570
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,690
thing maybe get one from Thursday's

571
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,370
using are

572
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,100
while dollars a different physical the
vice

573
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,660
yeah electron microscope would be nice I
think you can pick one up

574
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,850
like two hundred thousand I'm sure you
can probably get one cheaper

575
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:42,589
you look around the bed all

576
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,590
so yet electron microscope below see a
little bit let's go along with that

577
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,570
understanding

578
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,180
that you can probably film developing

579
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,370
me 11 teams

580
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,410
thank you lol tall

581
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,970
on said I had stayed on June

582
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:07,760
their forces I'll

583
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,579
both the way

584
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:13,660
I don't love both the program because
little

585
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,540
learn my job my funds coming here so

586
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,170
I'll what I can tell you is Penn State
develop this now

587
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,710
technology idea

588
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,940
decided that sorrel me said Alan C

589
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,030
the cell allow people from Community
College take three semesters

590
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,520
at where their entrance into Penn State
this experience

591
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,450
one semester classes and states lol

592
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:43,830
camps is prolly will well get you

593
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,319
yet I will today

594
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:52,320
I love know that campus today dollars in
his father's trials

595
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,360
space

596
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,280
launching haha

597
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,560
stay all

598
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,150
year call your Cup start offering

599
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,420
well right

600
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,959
me all

601
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,910
here

602
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,430
here

603
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,930
yeah there they are starting to develop
other courses in at the party

604
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,160
I believe day Wednesday is the only one
that law

605
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,489
the well your your homeschool but Truman
State

606
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:32,489
still possible of the National degree
city

607
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,410
there's a long night but

608
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,848
yeah put me down

609
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:49,150
well is it %uh citizen yes

610
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,920
we can only get that they had a question

611
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,349
from marina all by

612
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:04,599
from your familiarity with my crew
machines intrusive ok distributions on

613
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,170
what the state in the world today

614
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,750
is with things like what's the smallest
video camera with a

615
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,059
cool looking to see articles on knows

616
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,740
Tony years and honeymooners others for
bush the robot dance and things like

617
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,250
that

618
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,359
work well with the parameters love is

619
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,150
these tiny rubles the road known for
their Google+

620
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,579
the to get bin Laden over you know it
and/or

621
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,609
you know if they want a surveillance on
someone you have to rewarded with a

622
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:32,630
strong injured or

623
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,730
in the technologies that are getting
smaller be able actually

624
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,859
machine metal pieces come easy and

625
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:43,038
arm think I read an article about the
use

626
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,299
I'll a maybe it is but large summary

627
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:49,799
that check that close the Iraq before
ailing

628
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:54,670
I'll so you know I don't really have
much idea

629
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,770
the spy planes flying around

630
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,810
the world that was dark past because
than 1000

631
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:04,650
really know about so yeah of course it
could be something out there that we

632
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,579
don't know about that

633
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,119
homes using nanotechnology per se not
really cuz they're still trying to

634
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:10,619
develop

635
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:14,329
milk products for that using menace
possible

636
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,760
yeah on some devices that use names now
it's all wrong are

637
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,930
the other paddle can change

638
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,190
its assets valued based on the
deceleration me

639
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,190
all

640
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,680
food smothers on be able to tell

641
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,640
quality of the food bill itself

642
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,890
sir study decompose an article

643
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,950
networking components

644
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,670
I we won the first I one of the first
indications and technology

645
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,930
is is coming is a more transparent
optical networks

646
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,379
optical switches devices like that

647
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,450
making men's as we develop the men's
technology nanotechnology

648
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,160
following behind it some time away
through mentally break loose

649
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,200
and then that's one

650
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,690
me spotlight all so nothing

651
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,780
era ones devices that the bill a small

652
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,660
maybe 200 many online mir's can reflect
light

653
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,410
there's a device that the

654
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,060
size quarter and I Hess

655
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,460
radio channels on it when they do
reactions with with explosives

656
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,579
and it can be used on satellites and
space

657
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,560
attracted or line fractions and me

658
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,770
maybe micrometer so devices like that
are being

659
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,980
though I believe that specific its
boring

660
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,100
chip on on the rocket thing was

661
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,530
or on the on satellites believe that is
money

662
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,420
well that much as the lavatory thing
actually build a chat with these

663
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,490
means something like transcendental
functions

664
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:01,530
simpson crazy facts about the way things
that stand out getting smaller

665
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,580
everybody remembers knows

666
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,880
1969

667
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,880
same men to the moon violent back

668
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,099
I we're gonna see if that really happens
but

669
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:16,680
all the equipment and quote Houston home

670
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,019
all that computer equipment network and
clustered merging together

671
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:23,420
home if 30 for

672
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,509
has more computing power said on sorry I

673
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:30,690
someplace has more computer have

674
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,970
computing power and a third

675
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,970
has more computing power than the model
that landed on

676
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,240
on service people people not

677
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,829
thirties annoying little double toys the
they have for microprocessors

678
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,950
not not really oil plans to take part in
there

679
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:55,420
pretty geez PC work any other questions
about the

680
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,769
party any people and concerns that they
won Voice

681
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:02,109
is the first time I've ever given

682
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:06,060
presentation t-mobile high school
students

683
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,840
you get it

684
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,869
high school students a they just wanna
know how much money

685
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:16,830
degree yes so I guess I should say
something about that

686
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,180
before I graduated about seven job
offers

687
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,390
ranging from Intel Harris

688
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,779
fairchild stuff like that on from

689
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,340
25,000 to 50,000 style you agree so

690
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,050
there is if you're looking to make money
off this there there's all

691
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:42,730
that way from you the here

692
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:48,910
any other questions maybe

693
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,500
is

694
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:58,500
years

695
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,800
it we had on for that a little bit
earlier but

696
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,550
the fear this technology falling hands a

697
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,130
rotations and people at less than

698
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,170
less than good intentions home

699
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:17,109
we I guess it it starts at 8 a.m.

700
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:20,140
philosophic you if we tell everybody
about

701
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,680
technology is second make it safe for us
is that

702
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,710
me you know way we can be able to trust
a lol

703
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,640
in other this it's really complicated
and

704
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,670
it benches at technology stocks
advancing

705
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,700
to sociology much only had one class see

706
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,700
so

707
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,730
%uh its its weird another another
question that I

708
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:49,570
thought of myself laws that the and here
the All Hands unearthly

709
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:54,280
from presentations I'll assume we have
anonymous other than

710
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,010
assemble ireland home gym oxygen and it
assembles

711
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:01,320
human brain which is nothing happens
nerve cells

712
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,670
pathways and everything that they can
bring think

713
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,090
nuns questioned

714
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:11,500
loans so if that's something for special
people

715
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,880
father all

716
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,080
red budget if you want to be the first
to

717
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,009
conferences them

718
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,780
oppose the from to love the province's
to work for them in this field

719
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,880
on idle I'm any

720
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,020
although the new home but I don't know
that that's got a couple

721
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,610
this these events

722
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,590
conferences I on onto

723
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:41,440
job community columns traveling expenses

724
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,720
they won't be gone its 13 dollars in
somebody's

725
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,070
conventions might cost 6000

726
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,670
so saddle and are

727
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:57,720
like his hardware like satellites and
outer space

728
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,849
just a minute hands

729
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:04,089
stuff like that on that's all

730
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:07,288
goes back to the question about the
camera there want to make a motion

731
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:11,339
arm I sorry does anybody know with a
flat-screen

732
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:16,170
flat-panel monitors made the technology
its volatility

733
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,369
thin film transistor home you might

734
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:24,039
my might or might not be aware of but
I'll patsy

735
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:28,859
technologies upset reversible flat
screen monitor muses camera getting the

736
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,259
right electronics behind it

737
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:33,859
cool so yeah

738
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:40,859
there's a I idled

739
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:48,160
yeah all I talked to

740
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,500
I thought the PHDs at since they I'll

741
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,150
how far away are we from realizing
anything dresses booking

742
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,190
he on play me that the Chancellor

743
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:05,190
this month

744
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:10,529
party

745
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,470
up to devise in my room it was a lot of
followers

746
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:19,680
deal materials Mary and stuff like that
it seems to me

747
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,399
that a lot of what's going on was bill

748
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,970
tiny loss for a lot world

749
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:35,750
extremely complicated March all

750
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,480
seized

751
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,680
by taxes

752
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:47,549
this choice on popular sites

753
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,850
are small raises

754
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,670
means that cells legal inject

755
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,960
rose said it sells his

756
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,260
like those things all larger than the
scale see

757
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,540
he benefited re from technology

758
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,619
that Italy

759
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:10,430
when the ethical more quality I'll
devices that are

760
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:15,299
missiles well the want that

761
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:17,720
because it

762
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,480
be able delivers practical ways in which
the

763
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,640
resistance be his holdings to develop

764
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,299
news 11 or higher scale by citizen

765
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:31,759
I home work me DVD as well

766
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,200
see merson that short %uh needles

767
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,569
for people who have to have injections
the Eagles

768
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:42,410
and a so small that they can go in
between themselves

769
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:49,390
and cause no pain hmm but no these are
real deals the problems I have with them

770
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:53,569
is that the break a.m. in SL briefings

771
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:56,920
and then once you have a lead on that
small

772
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,349
long you working with forces capillary
action

773
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:04,940
and yep that's super concentrated drugs
everything's gotta come together at the

774
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,280
same time to get there are deals being
developed

775
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:14,280
band-aids again with sensors that detect
infections

776
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,810
yep that's thats that one other things
and

777
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:50,549
future was all just started spotting
loans things that happens on medicine

778
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:51,340
chapters on

779
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,470
transportation home

780
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,580
publication assembling

781
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,009
something else on trance thinks that
through

782
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:04,210
space but thats that's out there

783
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,320
but it's also on somebody's mind staying
on

784
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,400
he's in love with them doing something
he's thinking about this

785
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,130
assault is out there was thinking about
this and more

786
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:21,130
it's not just in Star Trek since I am
yeah

787
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:27,330
a key

788
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,310
okay this is going to be really low yet
to gain

789
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,320
because subscriber this buyers

790
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,830
Nature Publishing Group wish both
systems

791
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,350
New England Journal of Medicine nature

792
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,509
et cetera and the publish specialty
medicines

793
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:47,150
world if you go to that we do every day
measured

794
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,370
you'll see a big warns other things

795
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:53,390
Mitchell materials services lotions

796
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,980
timber over the interesting from you be

797
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,200
if you actually bothered field question
here

798
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,320
you have some information age weighting
followed

799
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,330
you can get a feel or this

800
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,580
official you until the end of this month
from

801
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,970
introductions bunch articles the

years old

805
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,900
its first alone another old

806
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,030
sir the full

807
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:35,190
on bus I have a sister ship they should
rethink their wonderful love from each

808
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,250
beats no sir publishing preprints

809
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,760
prior to actual with haitian grossly our
solar

810
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,130
door-to-door has tones from Nationals

811
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,620
stores this amid

812
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,620
Googoosh you you mentioned that you
cannot find information

813
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:57,810
Google information is Stephen over

814
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,290
find Google is just lost phone

815
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:05,290
spoiled

816
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,529
dance something more akin

817
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:11,160
the September 2001 issue is an entire
issue devoted

818
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,259
political party that here it's free

819
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,010
well certificate as a little

820
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,150
flows from nominee for coach the

821
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:28,190
that's that's one thing that we have the
possibly be aware

822
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,210
arm we're gonna people who were research
this

823
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,670
not want to get into the technical
aspect so they

824
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,880
propose ideas like ha chocolates and

825
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,430
happen keep our heads together and said
that's that's actually worry about these

826
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,640
and also keep that same people let's
worry about the consequences

827
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,799
can't let one on the way it

828
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,550
thank you I have the feeling that they
didn't cover this in new curriculum

829
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,720
for I'll ask anyway and was

830
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,320
was its relationship to computers for so
lunges

831
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,700
the used is that the cycle on a for
instance

832
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,350
mom as far as programming like

833
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:15,420
DNA program you know West was the
richard is so

834
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,410
were

835
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,670
for simulating the stars it's not so
easy that

836
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,810
physically you all like yet like I said

837
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:26,109
heard about I Software LLC park was my
first I'll

838
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:30,710
didn't get the use of fun streams

839
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,270
home is simulated

840
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,270
station

841
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,990
things fascinations rebuild

842
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,190
and Exelon's home of the substrates

843
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:46,120
the software is out there anybody with
with of time

844
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,870
prompting an unfunded so

845
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:53,160
10 officials asking about

846
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,810
software in general programming
languages universal

847
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:01,200
fires news what the status

848
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,680
software simulation is two hours ago

849
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,480
his/her the holes other in Radia and

850
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,850
yet yeah

851
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,890
sosososo about simulators and

852
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,290
go to me bottom-up the work things like
cellular automata

853
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:23,490
game life things like that with the
National Match

854
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:27,280
because it was the only 88 technology
degree in

855
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,640
have worked avocation title they just
want

856
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,000
they wanted technicians they didn't
believe others

857
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,320
to me well I anything I thought

858
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,030
stuff

859
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,210
home

860
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,510
so there is software out there but not
the three it might not even be available

861
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:44,880
but

862
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,430
it's out there and that's fine uses
think you're researching

863
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:54,100
stories to people can this phone

864
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,210
with about four minutes on anybody well

865
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,380
voicing concerns questions comments

866
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:05,420
it's going great rate today's
presentation last couple days

867
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,450
think it's to Katie well at home Francis

you many guys mincing around more often

869
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:18,120
that this declines have month give
stations

870

00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:32,359
easy yahoo dot com sunny

873
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:33,319
places

874
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:36,200
its became a little less

875
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,050
again the CrPC yeah

876
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,790
home and I'll check that email I think
the

877
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,240
plans today yes our response and the
reasons

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,430
trucks into infographics long

880
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,609
also so unkind biased in that general

881
00:55:56,609 --> 00:55:59,440
it's a question that I can answer and I
