are

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,860
I'd also like to ask be getting

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,340
that with cell phones of side all

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,149
its the case that bloodless

19
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:31,549
lots of ppl by dragnet of potholes

20
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:37,050
calls

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,380
is a way out like to talk about his

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,949
inside yeah hassle proposal work
teaching

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,260
well call nation expertly focus of

24
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,550
while introduces hopper in

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,620
curriculum hellz just voluntarily

26
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,159
that this for people

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,270
graceful high school college assorted
minimal

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,289
of not something that his week by

29
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:10,660
means buzzword minimum standard what
Willis said

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,010
about things like days me

31
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,910
privacy see see things like my

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,480
rationale this his are that

33
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,920
the schools are doing a pretty good job

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,379
well questionable jobs both cell is
working

35
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,420
can train people use computers arm

36
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,829
most States now having some sort

37
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,200
offer something place to make sure that
people

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,670
rival high school officer level of
computer literacy

39
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,099
and that's happening earlier early rates
are low

40
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,379
people in grade school are you here's is
library

41
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:52,170
papers the library

42
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,299
in the classroom so you have a lot of
computer use

43
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,650
lying on what I haven't seen in the
curriculum

44
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,290
are I body years

45
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,679
really anything dealing with the ethical
side stockpiles

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,840
security appropriate use information
reams of the basic concepts the ideal

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,359
value

48
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,959
information information things like

49
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,060
so essentially my suggestion today
although 3somes

50
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,130
details money is how I love arm

51
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,549
someone future us just day is to get
into

52
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,669
the same classrooms

53
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:32,819
where people are learning his years
wanted to get in there

54
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,709
said also lamar program use appears

55
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:43,139
I miss you I have a law actual game over
the Los Alamos los alamos work through

56
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,280
someone smile like I has great maybe I
was actually a speaker at

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,579
the haha late 2001 offerings h2k

58
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,849
office copiers go this closing open
wallets or

59
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:58,730
all inside the talking about his ideas
or offer our thoughts and information

60
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,400
ethics and what people

61
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
with computer skills that deal to
essentially

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,579
make the world a better place which i
think is all in both our interests

63
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:10,780
albeit slowly always crawl element

64
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,099
hawking it's awful ball but for the most
part

65
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,370
blockers I'll our article carrying

66
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,358
curious capable people and I see part of
my

67
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,109
mission really is to try to catch Hal
that energy towards off towards the

68
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,640
things

69
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,940
towards things that we believe on will
of course you

70
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,090
but some talk about the law all these
things that you know that since 1988 was

71
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,500
really

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,729
I'll but home parking lots were predates
the

73
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,800
that along those days todas las

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,960
of you are a lot of total of approx the
Sun open source search engines

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,409
all Daum are so holla properties

76
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:52,570
reasonable technical orange I hope

77
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,849
also whole outlook for film is why white
dial

78
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:01,830
by my potential a long one on we're all
engaged with of critical of Bush's

79
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,359
40 curriculum is baseless apostol on

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,140
it could be for all haha luxury it could
be four

81
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,280
legal worse it could be for mom all

82
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,310
on you know I all you education workshop

83
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,669
thing and I case in 12 schools we often
have

84
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,810
a are in New York say at the border
regions but I'm

85
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,789
cases all schools of thought governing
agency at the school level

86
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,909
maybe a school district level of the

87
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:34,560
I'll the city or state level policy
issues we need to teach you know what

88
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,659
people know homie

89
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:40,940
walkable though him off you know through
our bathroom trigonometry someone law

90
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,490
and as I was before for release on this
year

91
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,340
in are Creek law for case with wealth of

92
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,469
here's a our law in North Carolina
Raleigh all

93
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:55,690
live download ki chaal UNC there is a
real

94
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,380
is the hansel while that says that
people abroad with

95
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,110
Hospital North Carolina have to have up
for the

96
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,650
pretty basic but you know that Seth
computer skills are you know

97
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,760
the ability to is operating systems were
processing

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,820
strategy use over there email stuff like
that so not

99
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,650
not by any means either things that
people as long as they don't know

100
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,539
but only say a level okay and North
Carolina

101
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,729
has a fairly for school system all
national office are not a meeting

102
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,900
of place for public schools and yeah
haha this

103
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,349
essentially off fairly early moderate
forward-looking idea

104
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:38,370
about hear or see so we have these are
the strip club place

105
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,340
and what I suggest things I'll that I
think it's it's realistic

106
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,169
in the way schools were ways of computer

107
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,880
literacy things happen of to expect a
fairly small

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,120
rubber hose to be voted visuals surveys

109
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,060
up suggesting your other Alabama is a
say let's do a couple of models

110
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,780
for maybe a day few hours I'll get
people thinking about some resolve

111
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,360
issues and others said

112
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,940
I'll do it earlier people having parties
here that this brave

113
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,039
for the fourth grade 6 grade arm them

114
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,710
then let's look at them saw some basic
knowledge of about love you

115
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,479
now the of the pure skill

116
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,889
of getting into the all settles case

117
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:27,840
that sparked the idea I'll

118
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,460
what's the idea of hockey's hahaha try
well

119
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,650
my opinion is that there's not a lot of
overlap between what I consider to be

120
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,870
information ethics at Baja para

121
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,919
for well what what's on the shared her
of its

122
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,919
are and he's off to do it I'll the
valuable others

123
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,560
lawrence's sons the bottle questioning
the value of

124
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,970
arm open information but also understand
that some classes policies appliances

125
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,729
security I think by and large talkers
are are are you know please

126
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,120
SK in their thinking about these types
of issues

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,330
and in fact a little suggests Tom in a
moment is Lochbaum

128
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,580
in informing people asking about
information ethics

129
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,060
I think actually we're going to be whole
thing

130
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,090
hackers because part of what we really
lot of courage is what happens on

131
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,090
value would like to encourage people to
to explore sis

132
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,530
sandbox lost systems without being able
to understand them

133
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,759
math as for me for the most part
probably believe

134
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,890
I think that haha these are realistic

135
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,348
follows too long to deliver not by the
way stop

136
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:47,349
of a difference or weapons and bomb

137
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,589
so on

138
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,959
with the ER the act is being curious

139
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,709
motivated out and so forth we love them

140
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,860
curious but it %ah people there should
be more

141
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,280
curious the Italian people in the world
right of course right

142
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,800
all yet we hear story after story
despite the company issued

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,459
prices are rising of people exhibited
curiosity about

144
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,780
here's his sons and if there are cases
well sesame

145
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,439
council suspended there a store on a
public place de Vasconcelos

146
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:24,439
down rest

147
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,449
and this is the problem I'll tell

148
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:32,189
can be partially addressed file Hersham

149
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:35,949
the aspirational persian you have a
static think that what we have

150
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:39,589
baumhauer is or it'll take a lot of
people that have

151
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,060
shift because a lot of people lot right
now are teaching computers

152
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,560
runs schools stuff like that they are
hot you leave home Onstad

153
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,699
here systems people are drawing of
computers right

154
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,860
our soft domestic for the future

155
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,439
that when people are drawing haha wrong
of with computers is part of everyday

156
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,599
loss are you know school principals are

157
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,110
wrong places law enforcement Sarah we're
gonna have a little more

158
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,650
hopefully a lot more r-value are

159
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,130

171
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,260
but she doesn't get it so i i try to
qualify a lot because I think there's

172

173
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,740
for people out but don't care don't need
to know not on their job description not

174
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,630

175
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,570
absolutely not something that doesn't
exist I'll maybe we hear about

176
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,600
hears from those far-right but I know

so I think there's a i think thats

182
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,840
posing a mindset that

183
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,670
are of people I don't have a good
computer skill

184

when people use computers when Polop

191
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,110

of the things that happens

192
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,760
for some use computer he seemed like the
screen

193
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,670
like concerned about the mouse moving
the mouse using the keyword

194

197
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,830

world peace on trial bus lifestyle of
that

217
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,900
and that happens hola

218
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,660
to a large extent song share talks about

219
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,250
society nations discovering things

220
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,570
forums even though Muslims don't learn
ha ha sitting out someone else like we

221
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,980
learned of no good battle parcel

222
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,330
ogle not such a walk or something school
or something like that one way or

223
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,790
another

224
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,910
ethical things I think that hackers are
sold the bar ashamed of its

225
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,339
washington's okay so I'll

226
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,850
haha some other themes out eventually
saw police in South seems

227
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,200
points are and you might have more
actually I

228
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,470
thought of you more this is worth of are
think al gore

229
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,670
posts so i i think thats the

230
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,400
it's awesome but I like the valuable
information are

231
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,110
a lot of times people don't both
information as something less tangible

232
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,270
Italy change are thats impartial

233
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,770
so I'll tell you the answer is 42 right

234
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,430
doesn't help that much about how about a
question about what about hot that's

235
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,980
what about the information me that's not
a on that

236
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,500
and also that I hope they don't can take
lots of value

237
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,640
so the understanding that information
has value health had

238
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,810
value information by you will I'll
processes

239
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,010
insulation science of I think it's
something that doesn't get hot from

240
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,550
much i guess im some awesome the
subjects we know that we have

241
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,220
ya database we have we might think that

242
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,120
came to India information about people
some others

243
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,390
that they had a slow start right and

244
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,460
then we can make reports from that they
its low II

245
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,500
value I box the I'll displaying lessons
originally had

246
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,220
database Marshall last stock by
rock-bottom

247
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,970
mile are organizing highlighting
selecting

248
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,720
so forth and I think that that a lot of
people

249
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,380
do this but not a lot of people think
about this file waters on

250
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,110
poss frustration other theme of course
this patient privacy

251
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,290
are this is something I actually think
people to learn of

252
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,610
early age for that don't learn on early
age computer

253
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,130

you lots to learn some of these earlier
of Butler the same thing with

259
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,310
I'll was computer classes what they say

three-year-old

261
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,010
or seven-year-old something inside so

262
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,240
hola hola putting it out there

263
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,080
based on here but I'll people get to be
later a great school

264
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,560
wholly-owned along this website should
about

265
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,550
data about that where that might go

266
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,920
chloride like 10 is are

267
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,310
at of course is yet all urs lawlessness

268
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,350
about died patient processes the whole

269
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,730
popular pies's very they are lot of

mation and I'll and so forth thing

274
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,389
I'll I think that the things that we

275
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,740
think that paul also learn about space
policy

276
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,900
for trial of our brightness on the star
that we wrote something on us

possible risks of

281
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,210
awesome hearings for another another
prospect but saw

282
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,340
of getting we can talk about

283
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,649
the basic are bosses up security

287
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,010
David taking sleuth low at

288
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,250
juries thinking about some file print

289
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,560

what happens when I said place to place
of of floppy this thing

291
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,080
things like this pies a possible for my
are

292
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,110
was it is also possible for data about
me situation

293
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,450
arch angel falls OTL

294
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,080
both the the secrecy I think side that
for a lot of people that I stepped aside

295
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,100
saw because I am star

296
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,460
when you're two years old people others
like her first brush with secrecy

297
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,480

298
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,640
Obama on was there is a world

all that bought something earlier there
are a lot of games and so forth are all

300
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:51,920
about

301
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,170
keeping secrets have something that you
know that someone else's

302
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,600
no harlem's of I think that people have
assigned seats in the back

303
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,980

are

304
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,670
concept of when you have secrets what
secrets

305
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,530
principles by whether costs of keeping
inflation secret

306
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,960
of you are making a decision about
secrecy

307
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,930
is something that of of educated

308
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:25,039
dollars I think most people

309
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,940
let's talk about what's up with a slight
actually look like with the

310
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,250
was brutal as I said earlier what are
you talking about

311
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,110
is our are are trying to come up with
what

312
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,289

cause wasn't helped by a little bit too

368
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,000
early

369
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,090
get people learning about us basically
is not but there's there's a there's a

370
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,159
their public of you know both cases of

371
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,640
mean what I think at my

372
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,940
oppose the teaching is really make sure
block concepts like his policy levels of

373
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,640
those little different possible

374
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,430
but are if I'm teaching people to do
network news

375
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,790
right parties you email yes

376
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,139
along on his it look like one the
hotties 10

377
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,610
from on use you know hi outlook

378
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,640
whatever it is for our of offer email

379
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,730
but the first thing that he chose is his
love ya last

380
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,880
issues with our his bosses here's how I
guess close

381
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,170
again the hot sauce with the
understanding that

382
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,280
later on well their email client
software

383
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,720
I differences support our there okay the
concepts

384
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,410
applause even though the others like the
actual stations all the different so I

385
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,650
see a value

386
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,680
doing this this or insightful are other

387
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,880
now but i wanna make the argument they
have to know about like David

388
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,900
paper in order to lightbox word I think
that may be easily

389
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,370
as well pointing out but I don't think
it's far-fetched to say that

390
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,570
of of Nursing haha here

391
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,120
you're using the Internet let's talk a
little bit about what song

392
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,470
that now let's I'll also is a moment
hospital

393
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,900
capital say are let's find some false
spatial

394
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,580
I hot spots for information assess
whether we believe

395
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,929
while their trustworthiness so I think
that those types of

396
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,780
are this basically process hospitals
here to learn

397
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,980
onset and then you're using it still
Obama see

398
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,840
drive on all so yes I think so but we
have a mess while

399
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,050
on about about I think so some I love
people don't know

400
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,790
added the song I despite the fact that
the plastic have a little bit after the

401
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,460

holocaust skills

405
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,780
until the a team that won 11 so in other
words

406
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,850
it's not sell real estate to its that

00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,670
I'll this is this is the stuff you've

468
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:23,320
their forthright you know this is you
know it's ridiculous

469
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,458
to get people out earlier age to

470
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:30,749
embrace the notion happened here for a
good many thanks

471
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,799
but just because of years

472
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,418
trial i think is yell very worthwhile

473
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:43,200
are so of the high school in thinking
something along these lines

474
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,619
are to talk about %uh somewhat tough
questions

475
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:52,639
but i holla what they did not exist was
little privacy expectations of

476
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:55,950
of think a little bit about tell are

477
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,190
actually we'll see about information on
earth who owns station was access was

478
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,919
once

479
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,639
to of input haha and of deflation high
school is a little bit about databases

480
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,700
he said was caught up with the launch a
little slow

481
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,569
Felipe Baja things by of are

482
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:19,259
I'm very easy to to talk of I was the
slowest

483
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,269
information on on awesome

484
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:26,129
don't do at once on the differences
between thought that they thought they'd

485
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:26,599
use

486
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,319
I'll fall of trolls and how the school's
out

487
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,908
while transformation so what can we do

488
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:37,719
as I said example from the hospital for
companies like this but she

489
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:41,169
what we do with the spreadsheets brought
the delays

490
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:46,690
brought the or no sup stuff he's really
not he's a able to get out of here

491
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,989
and what value that saddle 50

492
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:54,929
that process I think that exercise gets
you

493
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:58,269
I'll outsiders you know

494
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:01,289
process and skill you know doing past
one

495
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:05,289
passed last week and you thinking a
little bit about what's happening

496
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:09,109
no once on the other things are changing
addition to those

497
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:14,029
Walmart so far water spring at

498
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,459
I'll another call someone mentioned this
way

499
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,799
actually thinking are about all more

500
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,859
thinking about ethics as more a

501
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:27,729
study haha this year previously I think
you saw

502
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:31,929
about us stuff your skills off towards

503
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:35,690
concepts related skills are

504
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,319
yes oh so that's really think the more I
think policy think more about the

505
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,719
everything security espacios model

506
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:46,329
are I'll I valuating

507
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:50,629
information in fact I'll things that
people to learn

508
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:54,379
college somebody like high school I
think a lot of people are self-taught

509
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:54,969
they'll

510
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:58,379
is how to hide information I'm his
library how is your

511
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:03,039
are to find information and is being
taught to read a little

512
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,079
long hard slog as vessel safer his

513
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,289
is the popular thorough you don't just
find out about

514
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:12,629
on-site find out about is that good

515
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:16,349
you know doesn't meet your needs is a
there are files that hi liza

516
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:19,529
Rella dollars are calling major so I
think that

517
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:23,059
at bill callers also you doing may be
somewhat

518
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,859
high school level and are and the good
news

519
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:30,769
about saw this sorry basic evaluation
information Rockies

520
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:35,179
whole actual I'll from by the evaluation
information which

521
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,929
is a valuable pony for this happen
either i'm talking about.

522
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:43,849
is job well pass rusher college

523
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:48,619
get are couple hours in the library is
parked model or something

524
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:51,849
for bibliographic instruction homes live
inside

525
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:55,079
well as all in like a place where
southerners

526
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,239
hibels learning happens but I think
without hot sauce

527
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:02,029
I hot sauce file package delivered

528
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:06,819
communicate so forth this is pretty cool
wins

529
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:12,450
on

530
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:19,450
home

531
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,470
okay so while so I houses haha well we
don't have a national

532
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,750
curriculum are no keep hearing while the
other there's a lot to say

533
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,960
you know that politics of multi-hop home
austat nice

534
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,270
past as a whole you know I'll I don't
think that that's

535
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,370
the way to go with teaching station
excitable cells

536
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,580
of forgot us early have a way of
communicating

537
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,320
are ya national basis want to get right
on to be

538
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,129
thing work what I'll as I said when I
like the way

539
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,600
well i think is no potentially workable

540
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,880
incident velez apostles at get those

541
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,510
our into some schools essentially for
testing by

542
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,770
outlook teachers by will I burned
collars all

543
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,080
get radio tower no

544
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,739
on a personal level

545
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,149
well and see other work gathers the ball

546
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:18,489
get teachers as teachers are smart know
they a

547
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,879
know the people of talking with both
someone from the outside us

548
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,929
you are possible us think about you know

549
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,960
what should be in here and how to do it
at what I

550
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,030
like to see out of he is something that
I'll

551
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,899
as call instructor in some you follow
teaches possible well

552
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:39,540
possible instructional Papa was like
here's here's a bus stop

553
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,790
visible overhead slights years on
cynicism readings

554
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,000
look parties and games however the
evidence seems appropriate just a

555
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,840
private things that you can use

556
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,600
to deliver some this are some these
criminals

557
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,649
sparking and I think that's pretty cool
of a

558
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:59,759
our wrap-up basis and then we would like
to see of course

559
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,470
I yeah is are if were hobbling

560
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,869
cases will have a real the standard
curriculum that the old computers

561
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:11,900
to get this in there you know the boat
to happen before the state boards

562
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,270
hand regions were doing this

563
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,340
status sensation and say here's
something that we've been working with

564
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,670
passing response different schools and
you're already mandating

565
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,880
the ellis et were processing stuff like
that

566
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,230
let's get this as well it

567
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,359
you know hopefully is I think

568
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,200
to me this stuff Beaulieu process just
like a perfected

569
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,070
computer literacy days or problem this
is all your process

570
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,750
but job pass starts off well

571
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,540
this is long on both sides one posing

572
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,320
are

573
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,510
let's come back to what the what's our
relationship is

574
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,900
to happen here I one through some of the
examples I thought I just saw the winds

575
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,369
as

576
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:06,690
you bought them as far as well like the
best Gasol ago I V

577
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,619
party orkut yeah of months are at

578
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,520
lot to incorporate are more thoughts
thing i think is important

579
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,070
to deliver like a venue to somehow with
would find it

580
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,750
to love this whole instruction not say
you must teach

581
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,880
a DNC was tends to happen hats

582
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,170
of but say here's some other some
possible

583
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,220
cross and here's some choices makes
while

584
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,270
are ya thinking of also I

585
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,710
up getting back to the long are popping
out here

586
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,230
as I said earlier I think that happens
we'll have a lot of stuff

587
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,660
and I think that for the most part were
self pot on somebody's part

588
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,440
several things I L

589
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,720
line through was thinking each other as
well

590
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,349
i would like to bring the laws regular
outside looks like a loss

591
00:36:56,349 --> 00:37:01,599
are someone also we have of not a
zero-sum the ambition no that's not so

592
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,319
in the case of water everybody

593
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,880
to happen lot is %ah you know what are
trying to explore

594
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,970
penetrated maybe are no use

595
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,059
unintended ways all systems kala of

596
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:18,680
that's not necessarily outcome here but
I think that while our heart is that

597
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,930
people will be more costly

598
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,529
less trusting this to me is good that
people

599
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:27,359
the are rewarded for curiosity
inspiration

600
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,400
I think this is good at so world will be
creating people have saw these

601
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,240
I process and whether haha

602
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,809
creates happens on our over theory but I
think that a lot of characteristics that

603
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:42,829
that we share

604
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:45,880
overall so this amorphous

605
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,410
not upset share with our overall
operating that the Sun operatic that

606
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:50,808
while

607
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:55,059
that we have of is really desirable

608
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:58,319
for at a factors for

609
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,359
of your initial resistance at all

610
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,819
is that what someone's going to explore
the system

611
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:09,279
trial everything else a lot of us follow
deal you know look for weaknesses

612
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:14,000
us about it his father that's awesome
well

613
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,440
but that someone's gonna identify with
their of Los

614
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,520
that's what I've done if either is
assist the whole process at the other

615
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:21,849
end

616
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:24,849
this cuter of this all website

617
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:28,339
others people occupations lot my baby
other

618
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,049
I'll farm of yellow bottles with them

619
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:35,380
laptop not so that we have information
about

620
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,319
us that we have some ability to control
we are some ability to

621
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:44,069
say cedras yes I'll to make information
public

622
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:47,520
right these are all things that I'll
I'll

623
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,869
said Park what we shall I think perot

624
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:54,079
the law John giving

625
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,309
especially the revival of I'm not sell
trying to say

626
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:01,829
Tom that this will make of

627
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:06,700
a high school principal that suspended
somebody for of pointing out that they

628
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,819
forgot to lock

629
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:11,509
you know PC or something like that of

630
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,630
is not celibate a fancy like by

631
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,010
but the people that were teaching today
possible

632
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,819
possible and funders yes they're going
to be

633
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:26,538
I'll you know that the Opera files

634
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:33,539
oscalus long long

635
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,600
are actually I talk with us or our own
over now

636
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,950
are getting people before the reform are

637
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,200
will hopefully be

638
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,020
more power like course

639
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,020
my dog by reforms couldn't sell

640
00:39:53,020 --> 00:40:00,020
tell are

641
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,060
I think we think we talk about all those
but but these are things that

642
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,830
all to me are all archerd

643
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,049
still at are shared ideas

644
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,580
thanks Heather were cross all over cross

645
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,860
but bathroom people with the site about
two-thirds appropriate everything that

646
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,680
we have today

647
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,990
apollo notices curiosity for the long
haul

648
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,440
the other boxes haha thats work

649
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,760
so I was that we have a few minutes arm

650
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,990
for AHA us that the clubhouse actually I

651
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,260
like the middle might be good there are
a few people

652
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:45,370
it haha while Michael people Russian at
gotta work of us %ah

653
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,799
are the ideas ezer a smaller audience of
people are saying that the web pages

654
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,900
at are like he's in the school

655
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,230
faced liar a science of something like
burns allow them

656
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,420
I got more systems the asses

657
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,710
best recyclable but also have impact on
the library

658
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,530
problem at so I think that's why I take
try to get this

659
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,170
into those law if the schools the
librarians

660
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,540
are a lot of people are doing college
instruction on here uses

661
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,040
basic Yale call longer series

662
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,920
as well as the wall high school this

663
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,220
okay so la casa Hans or

664
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:33,220
possible

665
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,819
a super group are I think they would be
more effective

666
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:43,538
but I think it's yes harder to make
that's what about the job

667
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:46,699
like something that just happens across
a poor I think

668
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:49,779
a hong a much was whether much

669
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:54,249
for groups like the most active for
helping to deliver some its nations

670
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:59,239
I think that would be of and so if we
pass on these models itself

671
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,189
maybe we're will be useful your computer
club your math problems

672
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:06,390
lot well kidwells a lot of people are

673
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,359
alone us schools some

674
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:14,699
hopefully haha I'll the concepts and
models

675
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:21,310
of the pancho purpose while

676
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:28,310
well questions yet

677
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,080
okay

678
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:01,130
I five satins by them that's the that's
beside tape by the fact that bus the the

679
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,410
synopsis is arm are

680
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,520
and blog world but elsewhere what's the
bigger picture

681
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,840
40 things like haitian policy special I
think this place

682
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,220
policy faltering all and

683
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,730
the the answer is that that I think
there's a lot of organizations

684
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,020
fighting on a lot of different fronts
add

685
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,110
by and large the file

686
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,340
stopping incredibly that has been happen

687
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,490
your songs bow what we have

688
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,490
yes are in many cases I

689
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,640
event example a possible principles
afraid is

690
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,910
it somewhat that's what she wants what
we have

691
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,069
is I think are the desire to

692
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,930
haha freedom information melted into
lockdown

693
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:56,210
strip access at believe me this don't

00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,790
come back come back all these other
sessions the aisle yeah I'll

695
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:03,820
lockdown mation is is not the way to go

696
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,670
most cases just of active haha suspected
doesn't work very well

697
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,410
are all I'll create more problems than
it solves

698
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,270
spas talking thing is tonight more lot
steel

699
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:22,310

he'll explain he owns citizens examples
possible

705
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,790
like of where r are all these efforts to
you

706
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,670
health are basically security through
obscurity is

707
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,750
security through secrecy all its
tremendously costly

708
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,210
add is only sometimes appropriate
Stardust

709
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,840

the thought this case I

710
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,820
every single day should be pala right
but he's saying that

711
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,710
of overall efforts to provide access

712
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,940
Asian is just disproportionate with

713
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,790
the are the value %uh something

well as well as saying that there might
be some cases where

716
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,900
that's a little things that I I but

717
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,180
thought there are cases where secrecy
works was easy okay cases where is about

718
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,390
a short term secrecy

719
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,400
Galaxy doll won the song I have like no

725
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,009
coming from the same sloth I forcefully

726
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,110
misinform point of view that somehow it
can all be better

727
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,200
if we can just provide access to certain
types of things

728
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,740
out to somehow make decisions Yale

of it sounds good I can sometimes work
on a small scale

731
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,560
but in most cases is not a war on a
large scale so you know

794
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,220
girl Killa that people are going to be
affected your users

795
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:40,610
they should be I'll think a little long
about concepts are behind

796
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:47,610
computers their side

797
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,960
here this yeah

798
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,350
this was a person farrakhan's aide

799
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:58,730
yet is because you're right I am trying
to create people that

800
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,850
the stock rather are yet

801
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:06,240
well you're here its it's really a look
at the Luxor

802
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,880
put some kid our class and while be that
girl

803
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,990
right and you put someone on a math
class all

804
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,620

because they sell

805
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,009
daughter on stuff for sale of and

806
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,160
computers you can use a computer to make

807
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,960
art right so I'm optimistic that
actually

808
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,710
arm as people like not basically it's on
the other separation joined the teachers

809
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:36,360
that are that people will see computers
as a

810
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,740
school for creative activity NEC kids

811
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,370
all times doing is a doing all doing
chatting and Sebastian also

812
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:47,470
of so the younger set

813
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,500
and hope with their teachers bashful
will see them here

814
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,000
something had that's really a means to
us Russian of

815
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,320
more than as a means to get past style
and that's what happened how people

816
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,990
%ah use your computer of only as word
processor

817
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:07,780
right that's why loyalties are always a
stage the program or something you know

818
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,730
when we don't think your computer as the
thing that we use

819
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,770
to write it off as a thing how we use to
of

820
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,550
you write programs either we think the
jurors thing that we used to do all this

821
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,040
stuff

822
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,800
side to optimise I'm a false I think
falls of Neuse that

823
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,990
with all the polls last visit: but
optimistic that there is going to be a

824
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,140
mindset change

825
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,900
especially if we see more people doing
more creative things with computers

826
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,300
we have or computers and all applicable
Britain ugly things that look more like

827
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:41,190
are fuzzy things are of course lots of
chances of course

828
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:45,410
you passing so power are

829
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,430
dozens of us all be a little bit policy
optimistic that

830
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,970
Tom Australia's the generations change

831
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,470
softball that set it'll change as well

832
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,820
close as I hope that people are going to
be

833
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,540
actually using a computer to do
something permitted

834
