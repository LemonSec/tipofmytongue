1
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:04,230
my name is

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,090
Richard Smith work yesterday scared

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:16,029
any real hear me I again my name is
Richard Smith network a

4
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:20,090
work on the internet security and
privacy areas I'll Serato

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,100
a website called the computer bites man

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,330
hands the cover certain issues related
to when things computer somewhat were

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,050
quite right

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,160
jens lot of fun stuff out there %uh its

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,059
obviously happy that we have your
computer by its manda home bites as

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,480
LP way are what I'm here to talk about
today is

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,620
and as something I've been interested in
last maybe three or four years

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,538
is the ideas love us doing sleuthing on
the Internet

13
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,620
I and in particular what I want to give
you an idea on her

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,930
we leave you with an impression today
that when we talk about criminal

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,789
activity

16
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,260
over the last three or four years a good
bit of it

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,750
high-profile crimes kids planned on the
Internet

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,820
and that makes it something that's the
intractable unsolved

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,930
potentially by by the Internet not today
a hassle of

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,150
a whole lot of examples is a basically
new stories work which I go through

21
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,909
injury go behind the scenes

22
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,630
talk a little bit about what what
happened I'll but we normally think

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,610
about you have anything like that

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,330
values is in quotes here cybercrime you
know a breaking

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,810
computers virus is the sort of things is
his crimes a contract on the internet

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,030
that and that's certainly been

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,180
been the case the we had

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,259
Rudy two sessions ago when you're
talking about

29
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,810
the bad trans virus sending his computer

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,009
'em you know keystroke catalogs from
various infected computers

31
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,040
and how the FBI was interested in you
know what IP addresses used to create

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,140
the email account receive this

33
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,250
as an example computer crime today
though I do you want to get a prime

34
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,840
example

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,939
and slower you know what we really
considering all hardcore criminals and

36
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,329
murderers kidnappers

37
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:08,349
arsonists and so on on but hell the

38
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:12,149
these plans also the of it into the into
the mall being able to track

39
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,180
internet a certain sort of a seattle is
the virus

40
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,010
dispossessed some personal experience
with

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,899
with this situation but this illustrates
you know

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,930
the through the basics tracking on on
the Internet

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,280
%uh this email message sorry this
newsgroup message %uh

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,470
from a march 26 1999 is is the original
message it thusly used to

45
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,450
to release a droplet the Melissa virus
and I was a simple little thing is put

46
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,110
into about

47
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,989
a higher 10 newsgroups this one's all
about sex on

48
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,879
and which is a a little come on messages
said there's a buncha passwords

49
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,849
love other adult sites and it was a

50
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,420
Word document was a father had a Word
document and here and the Word document

51
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,599
and then ignore the security warnings
you with and

52
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,120
you know send out fifty copies of itself
other people %uh so this is this is put

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,230
up on the Internet services GMT at 12:58
left cell at seven o'clock in the

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,640
morning as a Friday morning

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,620
and was sent from an AOL account from
Solihull skyrocket dot

56
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,180
skyrocket the old up our on

57
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,280
now one thing to consider when you %uh

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
in terms of legalities it's okay to
write computer viruses what it's not

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
okay to use distribute them and this is
an example here

60
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,730
is trying in in in newspaper

61
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,890
distributing it to hear us %uh so this
this particular example

62
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,129
here is someone wasn't so the brightest
this wasn't quite the right thing to do

63
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,079
here because it left the record of the
big

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,879
the virus being actually you don't set
out on the loose this is a public

65
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,950
the newsgroup Usenet newsgroups or pub
public for

66
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,760
so of in terms looking this guy's pretty
straightforward

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,159
out what you would want to do is you
want to find out who is using the

68
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,030
Skyrock

69
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,080
you all accounts at 715

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,299
in the morning on on march 20 sets and
so

71
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,200
are that's what happened here is that
was as far as got around on the

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,049
newspaper's

73
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,170
a me a a well

74
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,370
went back to sum up the log files they
hadn't discovered

75
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,680
that this account as login from an ISP
New Jersey

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,220
hands you know this is a matter looking
as log files

77
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,340
and then so they want to say the train
general's office at the state in Jersey

78
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,720
into

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,389
you know we think we have somebody in
your state you might have releases fires

80
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,600
and so that the attorney general's
office took it from there

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,100
and went to the ISP which was in
Monmouth County and said okay

82
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,320
we have an IP address 10 at seven
o'clock

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,060
March 26 susan's IP address well

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,330
all this took about 45 days are going
through log files because it's %ah like

85
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,109
pushing a button sometimes you know it's
like

86
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,240
you run rampant right across structure
whatever research on the subject was set

87
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,810
up to business sellers

88
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,910
you can solve crimes but it wasn't your
heart so

89
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,630
this virus is released on Friday and

90
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,680
the Got Talent releases fire so there's
less was arrested

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,759
on Wednesday the following week so you
know it's it's a pretty pretty quick

92
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,770
process here

93
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,770
on the meeting you wanna do this issue
gonna release

94
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,799
computer virus and onto a public forum
adult

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,130
and don't you have in your home on house
I

96
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,620
you know eyes he's also the things that
use you know they can't know

97
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,490
the you know things about the caller ID
or automatic number identification which

98
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,960
sometimes also gets reported

99
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,609
lobster so it was a pretty
straightforward thing

100
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,639
arm what on earth

101
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,940
was kinda fun here is up David Smith had
released

102
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,320
other viruses in the same manner so what
you get is due

103
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,599
ideas and Google Groups but back to
three years ago

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,990
ahead undecided Asian News I'm going to
say

105
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,490
I give me all the messages were authored
by skyrocketing real dot com

106
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,039
and sure enough there's twenty seven
meses haha the same sort of thing

107
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,199
he's older computer viruses you can see
it as you know as early as 1997 here

108
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,380
a kisses on this Christmas holidays here

109
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,669
December 28 I work at least other
computer viruses

110
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:21,060
and up in his right knee ways to go back
to look to see what these viruses were

111
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,289
well it turns out on that they were
written

112
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,750
a written by have fire started who one
on the name

113
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,120
bike again he s and

114
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,289
some interesting things about computers
work are were

115
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,389
Word files here

116
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,880
have a little program it'll be given a
word document had dumped out some hidden

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,590
information and files

118
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,660
what kinda interested in this is Melissa
itself

119
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,699
you can see down their asses revision
laws on what sayings is file

120
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,050
files added three times here by John
Holmes I don't think

121
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,349
what's the right thing home

122
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:01,530
anyway and see where where is that it
from him was a lot

123
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,060
on the last one I so I you know this
this kind information is left in files

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,139
and you just never know where that's
just gonna pop up

125
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,190
so %uh a number myself and some other
peoples are looking at some stuff from

126
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,240
biking in

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,870
vitamins website again he had a public
website go up and get information on

128
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,870
and came up with some interesting files
here

129
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,680
on as you can see here says document
summary the narcotic network class poppy

130
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,920
construction it's a it's a it's a a from

131
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,400
0 'em word macro that builds viruses
haha

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,830
or worms or whatever but gee if you look
down at the bottom here

133
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,830
me scroll is up a little bit on

134
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,600
the revision log has a lot more
interesting things in her does have not

135
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,330
me another call another fake name

136
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,580
if you go in there using Windows NT
profiles and says

137
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,340
a DEA's a

138
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:08,800
on Pinoy up and then over here again
that is number three C JP Morgan

139
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,000
and then we got the a Smith now i gt
Morgan was fake

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,940
but the guys I work with ensuites his
own although it said bank in New York

141
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,520
City

142
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,730
you know so apparently I'll mister smith
was writing computer viruses on work

143
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,870
time here

144
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,050
%uh now I don't has a John Wilkinson the
crowd but we never forget

145
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,330
he was at Southern so interesting is 30

146
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,330
%uh publicize

147
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,620
and here we have another example by
couldn't he s the DA Street converter

148
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,590
some kind about a utility that right
here to says flat-out

149
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,360
elsewhere right right in the right in
the file are

150
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,670
so out the bottom line is if you can
write computer viruses police say a word

151
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,150
from work matter once was you never know
what and information we left the file

152
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,140
and so

153
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,920
you know recently I here notorious pc
virus but

154
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,130
%ah puts free her jail on know when my
wife for songs petrie says what such a

155
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,870
good looking guy like computer viruses
from

156
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,410
a here i said i

157
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,520
I dunno I don't quite understand myself

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,520
%uh anyway %uh I wanna go on now to real
crime cell

159
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,210
and that's a a backdrop here you know
leaving information behind on the

160
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,730
Internet %uh

161
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,100
this is a simply example of a crime that

162
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,310
I I think illustrates hola

163
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,620
law enforcement can take a look at
tracking somebody

164
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,430
others was critically successful
arresting anyone it does illustrate how

165
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,060
to be done

166
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,560
says I want market in a research lab at
the University of Washington Center for

167
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,500
for culture as a group called the Earth
Liberation Front whose group

168
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,490
arsonist around around no burning down
are things going on like you know

169
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,320
lab City genetic engineering work
painting houses and neighborhoods

170
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,149
ski lodges and

171
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,610
in Vail a colorado and so on what
impresses me is I saw this story is a

172
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,600
right off the bat well

173
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,350
she had somebody locate this place maybe
live in the neighborhood this one you

174
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,610
know

175
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,060
lockstep you know sports the place but I
kinda figured they didn't know

176
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,570
maybe you know maybe where this was a
lot of these places you go up on the

177
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,130
Internet

178
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,540
side is sorta type this no whatever it
is here

179
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,149
universal Washington Center for Urban
horticulture into Google

180
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:48,149
the sea to find a website sure thank
goodness actually then

181
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,889
map doesn't show up but there's a page
he was the Washington begins you

182
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:58,009
you complete the russians to get to this
place so said

183
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,560
old well gee you know if they do this
website in order to get directions

184
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,769
to learn how to get there about this
issue we might hit

185
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:09,610
this this particular weapon eight so I
suggested to the University Washington

186
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,689
ages had one other buildings burned down
i buy

187
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:17,219
by some bad guys they may want to take a
look at their server loss a/c he was

188
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,930
accessing this page you know within the
you know to Lisa the fire

189
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,069
see you know I don't think so
high-volume page

190
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,170
suspect there's maybe

191
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,889
yeah 23 it's that time I as a way to
protect your potential Locati

192
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,940
you know looking marks here if you will
on

193
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,990
as I said before no one was ever
arrested so I don't think this is a

194
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,889
successful

195
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,450
successful thing but certainly one
avenue for for the for the police to

196
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:48,450
to look for these folks no harm now the
FBI those thinking along the same lines

197
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:52,459
here

198
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,660
this is a story from only a week ago a

199
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,829
where they said it like this very vague
intelligence alert was a possible

200
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,560
threats the US stadiums

201
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,470
and this is what it what it is is our
there's a website called world stage

202
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,310
go to and describes although kinds of
football and soccer

203
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,449
stadiums that are out there in the world
and some

204
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:17,260
I'll they were noticing funny hits from
you like Pakistan

205
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,819
to this website so they the FBI decided
this this might be a terrorist threat

206
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,389
and answers so they put out put out this
article

207
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,560
nationalist which ones are looking at as
a saint louis

208
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,420
to Indianapolis certainly targets fun
they're still standing

209
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,399
up it and I think this does illustrate
one other things here's

210
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,449
before you know using this server log
information

211
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,180
before crime occurs as a little bit hard
because you really don't know why

212
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,589
someone is coming inside

213
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:53,390
are York after know after one of these
teams take it well maybe you would wanna

214
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,870
go look around our website

215
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,410
know what's intriguing to me though and
figure this out years

216
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,100
who was looking at those server logs for
those people from Pakistan you know what

217
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,670
I was eating but even thinking

218
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,420
thinking that I am and the answer must
be on

219
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,170
that there's a lot more assertive
vigilantism out there that maybe then

220
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,079
the man we think there is another story
along those same lines

221
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,209
%uh up

222
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,240
in the in the Bay Area up towns looking
at

223
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,769
their web sites to get directions to you
know

224
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,149
sewage treatment plants miss or think
they're seeing the same thing his from

225
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:30,069
Saudi Arabia

226
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:33,230
from Pakistan so there seems to be a
little bit

227
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:40,230
website vigilantes online on out there

228
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,930
yeah yeah

229
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,520
this is easier though I guess I guess
that's that's the point season ago

230
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,120
Circle of Excellence and everybody is
yeah

231
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,750
so out anyway here's here's the website
world stage so it but if we do

232
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,890
it you know if if there is an incident
at this at at

233
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,130
some staying at some point the server
lost my my keys

234
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,130
but as I was a is says or after the fact
he can suck the project

235
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,580
alright

236
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:24,580
has a higher army here's Construction
News impact

237
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,950
yeah by as one thing I think that's a
good point please nobody

238
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,150
you know go through on a server in a run
on the server

239
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,590
thing in taxes just before the FBI you
know

240
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,820
they got enough to worry about here so
let's not let other countries

241
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,290
%uh

242
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,339
this is a another news story that area
in this is after right after September

243
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,460
11 so came up

244
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,060
on september the 15 %ah where

245
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,070
the FBI was beginning to put together

246
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,400
the the troubles the the in September 11
hijackers

247
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,250
are in the way did that after the fact

248
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,000
forces to look at all the electronic
records were left behind in some paper

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,800
records of other hijacked

250
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,430
it's as easy real names everyone is
relatively easy to do

251
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,220
it so those electronic records would
include like your cell phone records

252
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,990
landline phone records credit card
records any

253
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,130
work travels a day email this stuff

254
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,070
and so the investigation in September 11
very much just

255
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,030
collecting all holiday know one thing
that caught my eye

256
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:44,030
in this article in times Armstrong

257
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,950
this is here says morning according to
another FBI documents ever made

258
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,310
reservations by breaking a computer at
kinko's copy shop

259
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,800
in Florida it one thing had learned

260
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,660
you'll see this and some other stories
to tell that he has a favorite for the

261
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,160
tears

262
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,079
on the run hear a lot about

263
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,350
hear a lot about we gotta worry about a
encryption for that for the terrorists

264
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,570
and criminals or whatever

265
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,780
the thing that I've this is a liking as
poppy shots like three hotmail account

266
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:21,780
those who tend to be instance primary
out there

267
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,490
so

268
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,370
ha

269
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,380
okay in the article little further down
is more details here

270
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,280
what mister idea a yeah Misrata was the
ringleader

271
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,589
and so he ordered tickets from america
the American Airlines website

272
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,300
his frequent flyer number that it set up
on me anti

273
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,520
pay for other tickets he's the these car
he is the answer

274
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,850
year you know that the the year start
were here

275
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,850
the census tend to get a lot of data
about a lot of different people

276
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,130
interconnecting up because this is no
how they've learned probably about the

277
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,420
peace accord that he had

278
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,700
and then you go subpoenaed records from
peace see more

279
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,990
what else these car was being used for
army then start learning

280
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,250
connections between it because he
purchased tickets for other people

281
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,260
with that same nazis now

282
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:21,260
on

283
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,780
thinker I take it back but the up

284
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,530
you know he reads the sign up page at
the for the American Airlines website

285
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,550
that

286
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,899
that was used now

287
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,820
what's interesting here see is the word
the way that they learned he was that he

288
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,050
has copy shop

289
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,980
years you know that my personal data
bases said okay

290
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,200
who was sitting in the seat what what
happened was on the airplanes

291
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,920
is us on the flight attendants were able
to make phone calls

292
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,480
on cell phones and the top she the
airlines

293
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,020
their security department said okay the
hijackers and this airplane gotta

294
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,700
the seats any and number the flight
cases they knew that

295
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,130
to a meeting with their databases he was
sitting in a seat

296
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,980
and they said okay where how to buy the
ticket somewhere in here that

297
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,010
the they must one when you buy ticket
online live report on IP addresses that

298
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,340
were

299
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,399
transactions where they don't quarter
right in the database records and server

300
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,400
logs

301
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,610
you

302
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,290
again have a little example something
like that too

303
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,710
long in a sec here too what else you can
do but up

304
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,570
your bottom line is they have an IP
address that in that IP address bar

305
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,110
long kinko's kinko's does proxy serving
so they had to go to Kinkos and get

306
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,550
their proxy loss at ultimately they
ended up down

307
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:54,550
that hollywood came to us yeah

308
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,480
they were card to buy ticket online okay

309
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,530
a the signs are processes includes

310
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,790
hear something like that but but say so
yes I here

311
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,530
so they had an IP address that you know
ultimately

312
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,928
for all the fish all through a log file
server laws across Los whatever

313
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:21,960
that puts him in the hollywood Kings so
that you know that lays it down with a

314
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,250
bunch

315
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,980
agency across the place or look the
place over %uh

316
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,590
you %uh one other things that you see
there's also

317
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,169
is at MC his cameras everywhere in the
sea

318
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,480
on the most cameras to work you go into

319
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,020
they might have you actually had
official hi jeff Sessions many

320
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,870
time the other thing is interesting is
it a day

321
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,460
they ask what else is these guys do here
it somehow someway figured out they were

322
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,520
shipping stuff via federal express

323
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,179
about it some other money that was was
intended for September

324
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,240
was federal express back to the united
air republicans

325
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,100
so they're able to tie you know by this
visit the word

326
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,450
tile express ship see can see all the
stuff

327
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,710
time together here just by being able to
get a physical location

328
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,840
talk to people very much healthy early

329
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,570
I'll use IP addresses

330
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,889
now on nothing is interesting is
something I speculated on

331
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,760
a your listeners on the south lawn said
actually the

332
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,270
arm you can see here a the United

333
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,510
thing it was flight 175 and there's a
status report

334
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,620
here that you can get status of life

335
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,870
so one of the interesting questions was

336
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,050
was or anybody checking the status of
flight 175 with the American Airlines

337
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,399
flights from eight to nine o'clock on
some

338
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,200
September 11th you know to me it had
been repeatedly

339
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,330
said might indicate there was somebody
else also

340
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,330
you know another member the team wasn't

341
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,379
you know was in the actual airplanes are

342
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,390
I speculated that might be true arm

343
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,510
and I give a talk about two months ago
and somebody said

344
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:13,310
amount for the Boston area that their
company had FBI agents coming in because

345
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,470
it was somebody in the office checking

346
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,600
but it's not a thing about the sad thing
was probably

347
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,120
nothing to the hijackers is more like
one other a family member something

348
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,520
month

349
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,540
are but you know pretty clearly

350
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,870
that the FBI this investigation very
quickly

351
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,020
get use lotta a lot of what swivel

352
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:39,020
you know web trials to investigate this
crime on

353
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:43,549
this is another %uh serve that this guy

354
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,149
he had killed anybody and you know it
worse he had it was set out some

355
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:51,269
500 a fake impress packages

356
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,549
federal express or get the money from
butter to to Planned Parenthood other

357
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,859
other types of organizations like that

358
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,139
in any also like rocky belong hijacked
the cars

359
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:07,139
like the estimates are the song itself
as a Robert anti-abortion problem with

360
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:07,659
God

361
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,700
he's got to like here's its

362
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,099
spot 45 I and

363
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,899
I'll

364
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:22,989
he's yes or no self right circle
summarizes style I just think that

365
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:26,320
he had nine kids they probably ought to
be taking care that said

366
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,019
certain worrying about this little
campaign he saw anyway he escaped from

367
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:30,759
jail

368
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,669
and that he threatened to to begin
killing people

369
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,129
anti-abortion birth cert abortion
clinics

370
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:41,469
and so they're pretty concerned about
this guy up lately

371
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:44,749
Wagner and up was interesting as

372
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:49,259
how we got caught which is the FBI

373
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:53,320
put out a wanted poster for him but the
Senate to Kinkos

374
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,559
saying what all he does around the
country

375
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,739
run for about terrorists your liking us

376
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:03,609
well the reason they knew he like
kinko's is because they were monitoring

377
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:05,989
his email can and

378
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:09,229
are they worth seeing him check his
email on

379
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:12,719
as he has a fellow as a fugitive on the
run

380
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:16,039
and very skinny guys never kinda got to
the city's quick

381
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,499
buddy they knew that he would like to go
yesterday said all the cell one poster

382
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:25,139
in all all the Kinkos round if anybody
sees 'em with will travel that's exactly

383
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,009
what happened

384
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:30,129
on you know 11 other things that have
when I first got into service

385
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:33,450
this whole idea and it's losing an IP
address things like this

386
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,320
everybody said are UK's an IP address to
track people at stake in

387
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,269
to sleep 18 and all you learned about is
you know

388
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,379
another their proxy who's at the
computer keyboard

389
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:49,109
all these reasons why I the address on
Val but he

390
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:52,389
if your law enforcement you can
understand you know

391
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:57,059
no ninety percent is good enough it's a
is all you can hope for is an actress

392
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,809
on the stuff whatever it when you're
your strongest when you try to solve

393
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:01,509
crime

394
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,419
it's not so I whole solving and you can
use any certain any trick in the book

395
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:12,419
and I thought this is her insert clever
clever use of things

396
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:19,269
%uh this is another this another very
sad story here this is

397
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:23,239
a them the kidnapping and murder

398
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:26,669
Daniel Pearl I just gonna be a core a

399
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:30,509
there's a a core trial going on right
now

400
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:35,129
Pakistan for the folks behind this and
that the judge to rule on Monday so this

401
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:36,169
free topical

402
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:39,229
other he was a a again a pearl was

403
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:43,769
a reporter for The Wall Street Journal
are very much hands-on

404
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:47,119
he got the Pakistan to investigate

405
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,690
Richard Reid who he might and working
wes is obviously going to be talking to

406
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,979
some bad folks here

407
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:55,419
probably wasn't you know so the safest
thing to do

408
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:58,619
anyway are he he was stationed

409
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,080
you work at it India nitsa anyone up to
the Pakistan

410
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,749
any any was kidnapped what happened is

411
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:08,909
up there was a email message that was
sent

412
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:13,499
to holla two different newspapers saying
by the kidnappers se cuida

413
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:16,950
we've got anal her only thing he's a CIA
agent emergency

414
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:23,950
article here

415
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,550
so I in again him back to this

416
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,230
you know this is sort of a bad place at
the job in with the the guy who

417
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,490
the kidnappers use the email addresses
can never die at hob com

418
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,880
yessiree anyone I think hear a lot about
corruption and all things that worry

419
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,370
about

420
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:47,370
here your Hotmail Spain news

421
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:54,710
on disrupt quick here a this is

422
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,120
this is the actual headers from message

423
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,480
NC kidnapper guy what all these
newspapers and

424
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,610
and there's an IP address associated
with it because

425
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:11,610
populist puts it in the IP address chase

426
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,009
back to come home news odds with the use
of the Internet services around the

427
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:17,559
world

428
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,918
their satellites and so pakistan is one
of the big countries at the service

429
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,389
so you know just right off the bat
there's a fairly strong indication

430
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,929
besides the pictures that this did
public come from Pakistan

431
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,210
are this is about the limit of what

432
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,809
somebody can to look at with our being
the FBI

433
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:42,059
the FBI million to this company with
with the purpose subpoena

434
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,279
world cooperation this his company
saying okay

435
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,519
you have a proxy server we wanna know

436
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,110
who is accessing this particular hotmail
you are awesome particular time

437
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,519
you know that no one email came through
so that obviously

438
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:03,289
and of when it happened the other thing
is kind of interesting

439
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:10,289
here's up if you look go back on the you
know her one sec you can see

440
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,820
I'll down at the bottom here there's all
sorts of the email addresses the times

441
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,460
in a letter that New York Times
editorial executive editor and so on

442
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,499
well those email addresses had to come
from someplace

443
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:26,039
and so one obvious places like the
Contact Us page at the new york times we

444
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:33,039
take a look that real quick

445
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,820
see I don't remember the exact same
circle I really look at this you can

446
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,529
just see

447
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:45,869
little a copy of this page uses page
there's another server login goto

448
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:50,169
that would have potentially have the
kidnappers you know researching this

449
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,379
crime will be at the New York Times

450
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,999
and again another papers the same sort
of thing on

451
00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:02,999
now harm

452
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,200
the bottom line %uh years that there was
some stories here in May

453
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,610
about at a trial FBI agent went over to
pack since testified to talk about all

454
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,470
this Tracy

455
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,980
the email messages that the starkness of
50 K importantly

456
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,280
ago I'd love to see that to see all the
different things and it does it not

457
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,490
speculate here

458
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,510
have all the steps that they went
through arm

459
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,129
but you can see have what is considered
a very traditional

460
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,240
crime kidnapping and murder now very
much

461
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,240
feats of of the traces inch

462
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,870
another example here I again with
headlines

463
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,590
I just look for these nowadays had and I
look for web sites while it remains

464
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,520
reports the emails in the same thing
price this is purported bin Laden email

465
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,990
attacks out plans for Middle East so
this was back in March

466
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,800
20 March March of this year where the
saudis had some a proposed peace plan

467
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,120
with

468
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,470
Israel been lot number spas in blue
corps

469
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,510
had to say something about this so wanna
hit one was buddy send a

470
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,510
email message to you editor other

471
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,879
magaziner newspaper in Loveland Colo
hoods

472
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,360
I'll hollow or Robbie I'm a putdown seen
them right

473
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,740
apparently all friend his logs hotness
got four

474
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,440
and he said the editor follows a genuine
email so the question

475
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,550
here said well like one of those headers
look like for the email message

476
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,370
no it's probably unlikely that bin Laden
said that himself

477
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,800
on but it was probably sent by

478
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,000
a you know court has some sort or other

479
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,050
can you know where with trace back again
this i lead directly to panama

480
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,780
but potentially I'll who could help
locate you know where he is in

481
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,510
party Pakistan was sorry guess for most
people McNair's

482
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,400
well while using questions is so we have
all cooks

483
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,250
years well I'll who provides your
internet sales

484
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,400
you know is the newspaper doesn't want
to cooperate

485
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,720
here investigation you can go to the ISP

486
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,530
can you answer to hit them up so like if
the editor the paper so I don't know I

487
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,540
raise the email message are ready I
can't say

488
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,800
must be information emails I'll

489
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:35,800
circle of possibles

490
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,679
ahead %uh my there's no requirement that
I know of but

491
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,930
but computer people loved loss

492
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:52,630
there's talk about there's talk about
Europe for example

493
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,390
up doing requirements passing laws
because: the FBI

494
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,600
a real of course in around the world
seeing the value office

495
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,060
but traditionally computer programmers

496
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,000
say on people's information just in case

497
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,710
now source emails law enforcement using
at some talk about

498
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,680
yet keeping all email headers the last
six months all along

499
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,300
its velocity and saw and eyes he has a
business reason for keeping some other

500
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,080
stuff around

501
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,240
you know long records for said two or
three months this

502
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,730
dawns you password problems are

503
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,840
so anyway been on this outputs up

504
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,770
a newspaper they had actually three
different hosting services I'll just go

505
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,139
through

506
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:44,140
kinda interesting one as Rackspace in

507
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,230
taxes

508
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,990
who

509
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,170
me have work I so anyway

510
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,360
I asked her there was seen Robert Marsh
their

511
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,080
surfer sees pitcher itself

512
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,090
ides d rents out space is famous but I I
don't know

513
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,270
I don't get back but anyway I did ask
him personal email said

514
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,400
moving on as others new store has the
FBI come to talk to you

515
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,420
about that reported that lot email
message

516
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,860
and he he gave me a no comment

517
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,570
which is what you can expect this is the
right thing to say the my feeling was

518
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,290
just the way he said no comment was the
answer was yes

519
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:34,290
on have another another another hosting
service which is an hour Ramallah

520
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,399
Palestine

521
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,680
says here I think the FBI has

522
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,230
problems getting cooperation from these
phones

523
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,530
but I wouldn't be too surprised that
there is a packet's

524
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,040
you know the wire that comes after all
as probable go through Israel

525
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:58,040
might be a big ol packet sniffer there's
and the

526
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,200
for company's Web Start their base in
the UK most likely nope I came

527
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,490
came to this one on you know up

528
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,540
given the bylaws and you know arguably
the number one

529
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,310
one criminal role today not sure that
that the FBI was stressed

530
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,970
going through all the all the sources
here to try to track down

531
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,760
he still seems to be on the run so again
on successful but this they certainly

532
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,320
look

533
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,830
on

534
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,970
this in other cases been in the news

535
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,850
I'll thermal mom from last fall courses
the anthrax attacks

536
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:41,660
I'll where somebody email five or six or
seven letters containing anthrax to

537
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,880
to various media people as well as a
senators leahy

538
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,990
daschle on what I've got on the screen
here

539
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,290
is this is from the FBI website they
release

540
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,360
pitchers are the letters funny are more

541
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,530
more specifically the the and below sale
are you sending anthrax

542
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,480
and %uh you may see a lot of interesting
things on their

543
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,168
other person is second in my mind just
as the rotational you saw

544
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:12,299
was all captured use big be cast for pat
on

545
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,649
capital letters for these lower case so

546
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:20,819
very %ah thermos article write letters

547
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,120

549
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,919
okay well the FBI would like to talk to

550
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:40,918
a yeah

551
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,190
I have until I don't know what it is but

552
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,650
I I i financing this a late to bed love

553
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,880
here you know to write it out and up

554
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,810
if you go out in if you look at here

555
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,049
leahy letters the daschle letters the
the National are somehow got wet but

556
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,500
they're

557
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,540
there's pretty clearly in nine digit zip
code on their also

558
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,140
I'm so a these turned out to be the
correct address is you know that this

559
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,839
didn't write like senator daschle says
the US said

560
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,910
whatever something went to the trouble
up getting the correct addresses for

561
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,440
these two

562
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,540
for the two senators so the question is
will G

563
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,050
no what directory or how they go about
doing

564
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:28,050
and anybody got some suggestions where
you get addresses for senators

565
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,369
okay without that a question asking if
he's like that the whole address

566
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:44,630
ignoring the night missus

567
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,260
okay

568
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,270
okay look yeah

569
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,330
the library and fund and record there's

570
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,590
like that okay so those are those
they're they're out there

571
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:05,590
what a nursing is he got a senate that
are the only survivors is it okok slow

572
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,080
slowed your room I Pichia yeah

573
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,210
I the a

574
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,470
accepted each senator has a column fight
it

575
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:25,280
own home you need nine digit zip codes I
don't think that's in the I don't think

576
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,710
they are you going we go google it
here's something is some things you

577
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,140
learn

578
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,770
that about their others lot a lot of
different ways in writing and addressed

579
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,690
your senator there's a lot of variations
fucking other

580
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,770
as the the five digit purses nine digit
zip code is one thing but how you write

581
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,190
that

582
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,440
Russell Senate office building there's
like six or seven

583
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,520
variations on that same with is about a
dozen variations and how you write

584
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,000
and Rescue Center are first of all about
90 percent the addresses on the internet

585
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,130
this is proven by Google news 5-digit
zip

586
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,160
not the night kisses her and

587
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,540
that in Altona only a small number
places

588
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,670
spell the address the same way that
stuff your life 433 Russell Senate

589
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,580
office building %uh

590
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:16,580
one of those places its place call
congress start work

591
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,550
this is a private company it's so
chemical capital advantage

592
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,250
aren't so that they have if you look
down here

593
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,910
serve the middle the pager see the same
format 433 Russell Senate office

594
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,509
building Washington DC

595
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,650
and so on to turns out is only about
their for web sites that use the same

596
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,730
format

597
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,790
for the address that the anthrax letters
to so

598
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,150
what you're looking for is on

599
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,510
the Senate anthrax letters were mailed
on October 9th

600
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:52,119
see looking at somebody who was poking
around say congress that'll work

601
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,890
on the 7th or a for maybe my mind if you
look at both national and Lee

602
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,859
on the same day you have individual
pages for those folks

603
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:05,430
and then there's a couple other web
sites that have the same thing for nine

604
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,680
days

605
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,859
support again has been no arrests here
so this is

606
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:12,710
unclear is this worse but no I think
it's worth the route job

607
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:19,710
I think the FBI things shot too

608
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,390
know this is certainly another
interesting story little bit less about

609
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,839
the web but I think it's a listing
things we go back to the return address

610
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,319
on this is fourth grade Greendale school
Franklin Park New Jersey all

611
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:36,609
8852 well

612
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,770
there's no Greenhill school on their

613
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,040
is a plane compartment Jersey but it's
suppose not oh yea

614
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,430
52 that's the next over mana men's

615
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,069
transiently on butter is

616
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:53,119
in Kendall Park which is right next to
Franklin Park school called for

617
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:53,819
England's

618
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:56,980
happens ago from cages fourth

619
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,250
on and doesn't let you know

620
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,260
that's the hard to have this address
which has all these components

621
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,359
from from all these little towns and
teachers in North Trenton

622
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,190
and a not meet the guy

623
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,890
made up this address you know clearly
the address is on here to hopefully get

624
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,308
the senate staffers to open up the
envelope

625
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:24,880
has this was sent out after it set up
media letters where

626
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,030
numbers in the opening letters say put
on this school face cool thing assuming

627
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,309
that senate staffers

628
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:34,480
with you have not eaten or something
from an elementary school not

629
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,010
you this guy got extremely lucky and
happy note that all these

630
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,589
yes for the larry the jersey or somehow
he knew about this area

631
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:49,558
and question is how do you know about it
well as a couple possibilities as

632
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,430
no one is he he he lived in that area
work in that area

633
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,759
I remembered stuff many constructed this
is for us

634
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,520
remember the postmark on this here in
letters are from Trenton New Jersey you

635
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,180
want to come up with a return address
right around that area

636
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,720
so that's one possibility Z somehow with

637
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,069
he had some association with e-readers
remember this stuff the other

638
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:11,400
possibility is he went

639
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,160
on the Internet and and other this
information somehow

640
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,589
well he had a plot all that stuff into
Google

641
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:22,279
it poppin like you know frank from
Parker green Taylor

642
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,940
whatever or green rock he taking green
bra

643
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,160
Franklin Park and that's it her you
actually getting hit on the in

644
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,160
come up with one page on the internet
has all information on

645
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,839
and what it is is a mobile home park
about five miles away from that

646
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,019
Greenberg school

647
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:57,480
and it has around town all a directory
of all the schools near in churches and

648
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,500
shopping centers that sort of thing so

649
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,930
all information is on this one-page show
to this guy can hold his

650
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:08,808
trekkers somehow not construct a and is
also second patient has almost all same

651
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:09,720
information

652
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,180
but not quite just as a web page schools
in the area

653
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:19,250
sink in he mighta constructed the return
address of the Internet he

654
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,470
you know the new economy of a trend he
said get I need

655
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,579
I need to get a you know so little about
school for that hearing made

656
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:28,750
is all speculation no I mean this arm

657
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,450
you know we we won't know until somebody
arrested here what that connection is

658
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,000
but it's for this very intriguing

659
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,400
thing height created created this
address know what's interesting is

660
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,400
on

661
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,340
various parents

662
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,440
well when is at you I'm not anybody's
had experience I get the idea is usually

663
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,520
one-way communication send

664
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,950
really was stock and

665
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,710
earlier his little today surfing lesson
today but in general

666
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,440
it's one way and informations on

667
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,860
what's interesting though is he if you
go back and talk with a green book

668
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,600
school

669
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,220
we talk but that's it we talk about
cannot park it turns out there's two

670
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,040
roads that

671
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,700
me arm on top Eaton Road and State Road
27

672
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,850
in Kendall Park its interior section
where they me

673
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,180
and all the components that address
return address

674
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,940
only about a quarter mile away in
standard is corny look at all the pieces

675
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,620
that will turn

676
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,779
necessary here was really weird is a
sinus headache

677
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,570
they are telephone pole right next to it
on right at this intersection says

678
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,760
murder mystery dinners & Gazette

679
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,180
is at home which I didn't call to
reporters call

680
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,759
on but I i decide as a some 30 thing
when I was there

681
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,760
looked up there was a sign

682
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,990
yeah right tremors now

683
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,980
yes reporter Ashley from Wall Street
Journal did call this number of

684
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,640
unnecessary

685
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,220
I'll get worse run little little

686
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,230
on business here helping people set up
mystery there's

687

698
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:36,720
one thing that's happened what's
interesting with the with 802 11b

699
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,869
networking is your computer broadcast
it's madness

700
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:44,170
yeah

701
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,930
well maybe the and the right now here so
he actually has built in tracking

702
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:48,660
devices

703
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:55,089
watching as you go it yep

704
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:58,369
yeah so if the question is is an access
point

705
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:02,549
is good along the Indus benefit lots
back dresses

706
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:05,540
that's that's a pretty pretty
interesting

707
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,190
image but jerry cans with IP addresses

708
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,640
yeah that people in jail nah

709
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,410
yes that's all very true and that's why
we're investigating crimes can say oh we

710
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,279
get an IP addresses blah blah

711
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,240
the city in the store that's not how it
works at all you go out you gonna do

712
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,540
like you got a matchup you get started
yeah help

713
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,930
pieces the puzzle together IP address
for mac Address is

714
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,950
one small particles thats

715
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,730
that's that's so the main message but IP
addresses of you

716
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,119
very good leads think the point you the
right bus

717
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,119
your second

718
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,569
get

719
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:21,109
okay it the question is is it well when
somebody makes a plane reservation

720
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:24,229
can we go look at other databases
profile that person

721
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:27,279
in or is he is he's a risk here she is a
recipe

722
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:30,900
the basic question and I we do that
already a little bit we're looking to do

723
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,910
a lot more that

724
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,180
up well it's already being done today
and I meatballs

725
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,239
ever get phone calls from your credit
card company in 10

726
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,999
you know mister mister mister mister
smith did you lose your credit card you

727
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,170
know we have suspicious

728
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,359
you to purchase patterns here and that's
all being done by software

729
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:50,150
it turns out the same company CD the
credit card stuff for looking into

730
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,229
you know expanding business and go into
airline profile

731
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:59,630
to the discussion right now is mainly
TE's publicly available databases

732
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:03,349
you know political public records you
know I

733
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:07,829
and and I just wonder you know I
understand how the credit card fraud

734
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:08,930
systems were

735
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:12,129
in my case have been pretty inaccurate
eye-popping all 2013

736
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,039
times in actually lost my car once so

737
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,190
are but at the airport the you got an
issue here

738
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:22,569
policies okay so you has software market

739
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:26,589
is this makes america how you deal with
that person what they're saying is that

740
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:27,089
is the 1i

741
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:32,319
they wanted shoes the coho high-risk
individuals for the extra searches

742
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,519
which are now being done more randomly
are

743
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,549
knows but I I'll

744
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:44,199
I E I'm not sure usefulness other

745
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:46,779
I mean I can sorta see why they're
looking for some have a silver bullet

746
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:50,009
here to try to read people's minds
minutes with the car looking for

747
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:55,729
high-calorie people's minds so I I you
know I've had a wonder I be much better

748
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:57,140
that maybe look at who led

749
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,109
white schools are you know or what we
have better cockpit doors you know the

750
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:02,449
sort

751
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:06,519
there's lotsa ways %uh building more
secure systems but in general securities

752
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:07,959
hard that's what they want to try to do

753
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:14,959
what we'll see how it works yeah

754
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,710
well I'm not me I and I haven't on I'm

755
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,720
all I can tell you is I read that I is
to be loved by this magazine

756
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,869
at Barnes and Nobles also says that
supposedly Bob

757
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,800
I think Islas the 100 free texting which
is sorta line to get the information

758
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,890
resent their stuff about phone records

759
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,830
for different stories about getting
farmers I just unexploded

760
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,848
in that area palm but this there is a
lot of date out there on so obviously

761
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:51,500
you know credit card records phone
records all this stuff

762
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,500
on you know proving it to another word
circumstance under such

763
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,730
yep when only guess

764
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:06,730
yeah

765
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:15,400
in what situation it has a situation up

766
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:22,400
yeah the question is when will I S p's
turn over data

767
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:34,260
fire

768
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,710
obtain adequate story along those lines
as another one is really

769
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,550
really sad stories but I gotta I got an
email once from

770
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,920
up a lot mission saying with

771
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,050
we think something's funny with our
needs getting enough

772
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,760
armor but it just doesn't seem like it's
far and is there any way using

773
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,329
well bugs and other stuff we can somehow
determine if it's really her writing

774
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,030
emails

775
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:04,240
and I look at this I says analysis
overprotective aunts and uncles

776
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,540
I with the situation yes I said we'll
send me e-mail so the symphony

777
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:12,480
said okay well here's the IP addresses
from it belongs to the size P

778
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,200
go with your lawyer to these people try
to get whatever day you can so I said

779
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,150
the little lawyer

780
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,990
well before five months later that I
read about in the news East this paper

781
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,220
that use a victim of

782
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:26,069
sexual murder so the the aunts uncles

783
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:30,040
a feeling about email messages

784
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,430
workforce right on target but I settle
with the lawyer

785
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:42,430
those files yeah

786
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,920
well i i think i i goes back to what I
was saying before he had corroborated

787
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,840
the evidence so in certainly defense
attorney can attack may be on those

788
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,610
grounds

789
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:16,520
are a test to attack sprout up but but I
think there'll be corroborating evidence

790
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,420
that would serve say otherwise

791
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,220
saw I don't think it is reliable of
Holland and that's it

792
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,650
send somebody often on opening day of
the impact Scott seriously says he

793
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,590
