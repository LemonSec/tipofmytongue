00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,510
that has to be devoted to solid namely
harm

314
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,080
it Tom shitty alright I want product com
I take here

315
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,020
one for the complaints only deals that
person it doesn't like the chainsaw

316
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,600
army today photo I got from South
America

317
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,740
if he takes off her masaje but

318
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,030
so Thompson di love it when the person
race back should be a little

319
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,190
system said every gets all a minute when
he's done it that

320
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,700
the next message goes to someone else
Lee weeds and then weeds deals with the

321
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,780
that whatever the next problems that

322
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,220
child swallowed by the sneaking settled
near

323
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,520
somewhere there's a BK major a

324
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,510
it

325
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,350
see the a annette then a

326
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,260
I'd hold the the FBI that I i wouldn't
give them the data on this you know that

327
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,600
you got a court order

328
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,340
or um that they somehow had the judicial

329
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,070
branch arm stepping in

330
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,889
you don't have the same as the my head
executive judicial branch checks

331
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,460
balances term in all the stuff in high
school

332
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,670
and he just said coincide and I guess I
was about two weeks ago in the New York

333
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,770
Times is this

334
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,910
charter on their homeland security front
how they want to reorganize it near

335
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,100
all these little three-letter acronyms
and how it all arranged in

336
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,120
in was he that that's legal but

337
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,280
it turns out the FBI's rate below the
judicial branch

338
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,139
and didn't think that investigation
Federal Bureau of Investigation so of

339
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,800
course the

340
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,530
coarser indium whatever they want um so

341
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,770
the FBI came game you're looking at is
it is for guys

342
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,940
instance she in a black SUV

343
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,090
is so predictable a

344
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,820
II poll in my car in people in behind me
in with I don't know if he can fall on

345
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,350
your way

346
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,020
but if they went down the block to a to
another warehouse sale is a

347
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,690
I work in this area with a buncha
warehouses and a

348
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,250
as appears in a couple different ones
they wanted a different one

349
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,010
like this case the within the
neighborhood but I was in a hurry

350
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,640
there's a server down in the

351
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,770
know the data centers as running to grab
my laptop to go back out and

352
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,120
um here 31 Mb

353
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,790
don't back down my stairs cell phone
dreams is my friend deeply keepers

354
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,320
really here I look down the stairs

355
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,950
by one of my roommates is just leaving
issues like blocking the door at stake

356
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:26,950
into the glass door I don't know he's
here she looks at that makes delight

357
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,940
well I was expecting them to come so

358
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,140
was a plane running at this point a I
knew and you that they're going to come

359
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,820
and do only had windows on the second
floor there wasn't partner on

360
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,189
them um so I I went and said hi

361
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,370
I was really scared for says shaking for
about 30 seconds

362
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,450
kill me global

363
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,030
bit that I calm down and arm and then we
had a little chat

364
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,310
in out for a ride in the SUV and that
not at the table

365
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,580
talked about then

366
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,139
and um

367
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,170
we went to the data center

368
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,630
I got to work on the computer that was
down the healthy

369
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,350
good a I shoulda

370
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,830
detecting it there is one guy

371
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,210
at um there's four guys if one big burly
guy

372
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,300
is like the muscle then there is a then
there's a quiet guy didn't say anything

373
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,760
the whole time I get back to him

374
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,990
then this guy did all the talking he's
the ringleader and then there is the

375
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,880
asian guy use the tape I Alistair take
here but that's just the way it works

376
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,400
out

377
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,530
yeah he wears black suits the techies
are Asian

378
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,760
on yeah they're you

379
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,980
and he's fun

380
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,360
you get to write an SUV um nearly all
say only people that to the

381
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,890
to the data center cuz a someone
apparently

382
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:07,890
keep their SUV you out there do I have
had a lot of neighbors that look out for

383
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,180
me

384
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,680
the stupid but I I don't know what
happened I think the

385
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,280
bond in the sum construction on the way
there's a lot of construction sales guys

386
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,149
are really bad

387
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,810
I don't really think it is a key good

388
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,980
at all for it they threaten me

389
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,470
and they didn't need to I was scared
gold

390
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:38,270
are that I was like unholy scared I
wasn't kissing myself skew

391
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,600
but I'll after 30 seconds a calm down
this is located not gonna kill me they

392
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,870
probably would have already done that

393
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,310
you just here to talk to me in is gonna
be Kong

394
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,060
it actually is is finally answer to
drive over the data center

395
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,240
which sister for miles from my house
from where the inward

396
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,990
we chatted about the date at Fulham I'll
think he catches hapless

397
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,520
in well eating shit okay you

398
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,570
at all my reason rationale that then

399
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,700
D-day is its private

in is not stuff that people intended
other people remain special ago

402
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:25,950
it's like a on and do it well you know
it might help us catch the culprit well

403
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,260
i DD IP addresses signed up for the

404
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,120

account %uh this is something else you

407
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,260

like that who

408
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,340
as okay

409
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,470

425
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,710
their own team nor update don't think so
Hilton

426
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,680
so in fact I turned on the charm I
turned on the

427
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,820
collection totally alone

428
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,230
turned turn back on the collection data
before

429
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,690
HD que se to get fresh pack a good stuff
really three days I got half a game or

430
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,890
emails dissect look three finding
patterns to talk about

431
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,970
at least seven patrons that any outside
i reset

432
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:20,060
that email address and thence someone
back to the free email thing inside of

433
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,350
the sock my pic added

434
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,250
suck my prick alias again in a bit
different mailbox

435
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,610
City the any they got and then I went in
I

436
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,420
Texas so that they can do that again
change occurred a little

437
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,940
but I'll so I had to be a mailbox is
where the

438
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,550
a the worm data had been going to give
this the FBI

439
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,970
TI no problem with helping out as much
as I think I should help

440
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,930
K a if anyone here has a run with the
FBI

441
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,180
you know try to follow the law I mean
you want to be in jail

442
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,440
on a no 8 and I thought maybe the law

443
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,400
provision for privacy no

444
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,380
there's no threats none

445
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,950
no nothing like that really

446
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,830
it he said they sent me at a document in
the mail

447
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,970
I'm not get a what it was and i suppose
im and there's a little close in on it

448
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,360
say it was a sign that is a funny joke

449
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,970
design Big Brother then contact the
editor and

450
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,360
hahaha and that and as but that was
kinda funny but at the same health care

451
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,920
that it said

452
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,470
it's a as I turned off the alias I got a

453
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,540
got that stuff back are past this

454
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,360
oh that the program that does a free

455
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,310
email revealing watches the mail on

456
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,700
there's more than and in 15 minutes it
shows that user of them

457
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,190
it is more than X in an hour chase them
off as well so Israel

458
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,470
throttles this free service I don't you
will then take

459
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,510
binge in it for were data collection or
for

460
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,200
that's been in people's really heats are

461
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:15,200
at sea

462
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,730
it dumped into a file for me to see it's
a spam or not it's a standard practice

463
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,440
by is

464
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,260
these down that's why I am was able to

545
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,839
a weekly in San Francisco that there'd
been an article on

546
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,989
a me withholding the data from the FBI

local

554
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,830

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,569
how did you look to the world this
chemical cultural phenomena

686
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:20,759
and whenever something comes up like
this and try to incorporate it into the

687
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,710
first win say

688
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:26,700

689
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,560
around it in the news me USA Jenna
looked ibid I didn't think the sad

690
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,609
someone pick these a because

691
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:37,790
general is a lot hotter in the media

692
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,869
in the I figured if I got d if they're
two pictures up there
