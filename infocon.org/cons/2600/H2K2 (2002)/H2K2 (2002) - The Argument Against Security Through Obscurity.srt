1
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,559
indicate to you

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,070
each student katie's starting off

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,050
i hope it without your conference so far
it appears to be blood tests arrival

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,439
and very fine

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,849
day yesterday this is funny to me

6
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:27,099
heading out

7
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,899
pretty good overnight does not as many
people as i might have guessed hanging

8
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,820
around outside

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,650
a pretty good

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,540
people wandering the streets in that

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,370
and i'm so far has been a very peaceful

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,849
conference

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,100
very responsible of the very important

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,900
try to keep that red wine

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,820
throughout uh... throughout the day

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,470
so i will be myself introduction here by
that is great

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,540
anti cd running around a little bit of
doing a few other things at the

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,080
conference um...

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,129
over the weekend

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,900
and managed to get talked

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,150
yesterday's dot handle and uh...

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,630
this talk actually is

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,710
separatism most overlap with the stuff
we talk about yesterday

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,210
impetus for this talk really is

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,210
i see so much

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,020
very very

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,738
war

28
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:19,350
security

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,369
physical world

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,310
uh... just poorly implemented poorly
thought out

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,960
we're related dialogue and i said well
it would take a whole lot of just just

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,530
lose feedback

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,670
to really improve that

34
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,500
of course you have to

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,580
question while you're thinking about
that well

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,140
babies it s on a_b_c_'s all worth it

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,210
to spend the extra effort spend the
extra time

38
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,810
speak thing i wanted to address because
we talk about the risks

39
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,100
cost-benefit analysis but they are a lot
of addresses

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,360
what if we change our mindset

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,400
in the physical world

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,030
physical security or non computerized
sense of security

43
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,750
to be where our minds already are

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,270
the computerized

45
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,469
because for the most part

46
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,620
weed out people in this room now

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,820
that security to obscurity

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,079
is not affected

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,310
allotments are

50
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,059
not even in the short run

51
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,649
in computer assistance

52
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,759
so as i said the impetus was looking at
the best

53
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,499
security the physical world saying well

54
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:20,040
maybe we get decent restaurants a lot of
fun to be transferred some physical

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,469
world computerized probative stopped

56
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:24,869
so this is actually

57
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,180
fairly simple idea

58
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,789
which i just described to you

59
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,369
but all work through some of the line

60
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:33,159
to be some samples some not some
thoughts on that

61
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,959
and when it reshape your interviewees
obv is that this just sounds completely

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,579
ridiculous because maybe they are going
to happen

63
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,719
not picking up

64
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,539
where they should be more

65
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,889
and they they are good examples for or
give them

66
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,459
concert that's all that

67
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:51,259
this is the world but

68
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:55,699
but i'll give you the argument that you
can judge for yourself

69
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:00,089
to lay out my district maybe as i said i
have now actually a fact

70
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,499
in the school of information

71
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,849
blackbird sign

72
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,599
at university

73
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,429
starting this month university of north
carolina

74
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:13,359
had been there for about six years

75
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,460
i keep shop

76
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,020
dull thing still with information
science elsa

77
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,919
course information security

78
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,449
i've done internet courses for a long
time

79
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,029
sort of next moments

80
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:26,869
systems administration decent work

81
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:31,680
large-scale open source information
people

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,179
search engines

83
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:36,389
or other countries

84
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,569
and no actually

85
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:44,569
slightly ahead

86
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,680
so long

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,499
what we're talking about a security
obscurity

88
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:51,638
i think the most of the age to get to
you

89
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,799
conference u_b_s_ securities through fsc
here is that something that

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,209
document here

91
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,510
without

92
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,418
uh... one of the arguments

93
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,319
few minutes

94
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,279
for open-source software

95
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,329
we compare open-source selective

96
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,159
software notebooks

97
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,078
where you can see the source code

98
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,259
i would say well

99
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,430
in the open source

100
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,469
the airwaves security model is

101
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,840
by really anybody that wants to be told
by experts

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,830
echo drive motivation desired skills

103
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,250
and if you don't have the source code

104
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,439
what we're doing is worse hearing

105
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,759
whatever the security problems are

106
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,669
making source code

107
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:36,378
oligarchy

108
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,620
security problems go away

109
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,389
securities your obscurity

110
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,990
is really something that that can work
it so it does work

111
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,550
but in the short term

112
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,259
except it doesn't actually improve your
your arm

113
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,929
involved all the different sizes tax
call it does that makes it a tax

114
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,500
fourteen

115
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,729
we'll talk more about that

116
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,620
a little bit later on so he says it is a
fairly competition

117
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,479
work for a lot of the uh...

118
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,330
we've got a false sense of security

119
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,469
security pacific both secret

120
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:10,879
therefore it's good

121
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,570
right now does this really

122
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,969
you know impact the actual

123
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,210
procedure that where you think

124
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,580
really talking about today

125
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,308
is making the procedure

126
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:23,970
so that in fact that it doesn't need to
see

127
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,370
if works here we have a limited ability
to verify its let's say and what leaves

128
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,270
a lot software examples but we're we're
all going to do is make transfer train

129
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,690
let's see your company turbines software
all they don't give you the source code

130
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,779
then you have

131
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,069
more difficulty if you want to do it
code on it yet more difficulty trying to

132
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,649
access the bomber

133
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,150
that's estimated

134
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,460
here people have looked at photo for
complex the sense that

135
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,339
i sent her a large tax

136
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,819
to look at

137
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,150
lifecodes operatives to solve it

138
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,080
they're the ones

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,969
point to you at the side

140
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,310
the vulnerability so it does happen
sometime

141
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,110
but at the open birds the open source
does help

142
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,219
more openings open standards

143
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,289
uh... you know

144
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:15,889
the discussions of the designs

145
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,340
and etc identity uh...

146
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,430
the boulder police who's gonna look for
these all over the lease

147
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,389
if we have a serious issue

148
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,590
let's let's do it as one of us air bag
system right back

149
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,679
altogether bring the money in an hour

150
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,699
and security guards and stuff like that

151
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:32,640
all of it or not

152
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,200
but it's really saying that all of the
everything the way the combination to

153
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,199
the bank of security guards home

154
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,449
home address work schedule and stuff

155
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,909
should be open for screaming about it
and say this

156
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,248
that baby secrecy should be a part of
our

157
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:49,320
let's think of the bank

158
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,099
who is a display study dot banget tribe
discover their vulnerabilities

159
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,039
all you know it is a bottom it says

160
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,350
and uh... yeah okay

161
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,639
peaks or whatever

162
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,749
that he would be worried out of trouble
sprite

163
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:05,309
whatever's exterior

164
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:09,169
someone just i want you didn't hear back
in business

165
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:15,710
polyethylene nearly six years and i want
to spend the effort

166
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,439
you know one incident

167
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,439
so that's where the obscurity doesn't

168
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,099
doesn't get you much-ballyhooed

169
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,750
so you can be a good

170
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,400
of security model

171
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,370
but ask yourself i don't think there's
not much for you

172
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,640
when things are a lot of doctor saheb

173
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,810
problems like this morning

174
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,740
his notion of the insider

175
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,099
in everything from banks and businesses
torn stuff like that because the world

176
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:49,780
coming here about this without these

177
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,180
airport security and stuff like that is
the inside of someone else

178
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,359
knows

179
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,520
bought some news

180
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,008
penetrated the obscurity

181
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:02,249
often the person who's the perpetrator
in america and all

182
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,229
retirees are not supposed to be doing

183
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:08,479
the outsider has difficulty in unveiling

184
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,590
that obscurity

185
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,129
the insider has previously villains here

186
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,250
so once again we have this tell you

187
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,069
industry doesn't help us

188
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,870
really that situation what would rather
have

189
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,459
process

190
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
in which

191
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,719
about

192
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,469
almost everything you ever think about
how the system works

193
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,498
doesn't make the process of the week

194
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,950
if that's the case you got something
process

195
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,890
will mentioned uh... bandage dr congo
crypto

196
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,400
bassett crypto

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,610
indian crypto

198
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,010
you don't have security

199
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,530
until your procedure has been examined

200
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,910
very very closely

201
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,890
and even then the trip to experts
millions of dollars

202
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,060
doorbell wants a hundred percent does it
all seems pretty good

203
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,550
it over there might be other things we
have

204
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,910
uh... discovered

205
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,939
so i got the better

206
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,530
when someone physically

207
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,180
too doesn't it doesn't

208
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,030
obscurity and

209
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,110
uh... purposes dot com things

210
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,950
we have a lock the keypad here of course
that

211
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,340
issue katie might

212
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,880
uh... but know that a lot picking at a
stupid you

213
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,839
is less

214
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,530
then the lock picking presidents at cal
two thousand

215
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,240
across the pond

216
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,320
fights goes that is

217
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,550
exactly exactly you're not even allowed
to owned lock picking tools incident

218
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:38,550
some situations economics on situation
can

219
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,199
well it would be a sport here to view
could do it right

220
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:49,200
so on

221
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,330
but uh... i don't want smaller presence
they and we actually spoken smile that

222
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,260
this is a reprieve the brutal octopi

223
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,860
that was an alibi that age to get used
to be back here page to take two

224
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,030
they were interested in sitting around
showing people how to do stuff player

225
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,150
also concerned about because they have

226
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,500
there's often a fine

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,870
kind of fear

228
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,560
between was

229
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,150
it did not bad

230
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,340
on premises is that what has happened

231
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,550
the idea that

232
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,050
that cell phones

233
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,440
and instead have cell phones which are

234
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,350
recently secured insulin more secure
like that happens that yes outcomes

235
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,430
history making a legal issue of operated
spam

236
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,590
or to purchase them

237
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,460
u_s_ except the cell phone three

238
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,130
right and the people at it

239
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,640
if the people i'd like to stop what
should people and what he had some sort

240
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,150
of criminal intent to some sort of
malicious intent

241
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,540
or a person wants that

242
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,140
it gets down from overseas

243
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,790
that that was there

244
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,150
stores of course palm i think are are
pretty common

245
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,860
where you know that there's probably
some watching

246
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,880
to make sure you don't steal stuff

247
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,300
we don't really know those cameras on
their tactic you might have in mind

248
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,240
aren't stuff up

249
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,690
dom we'll see

250
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,300
i bring us towards a couple times but
will see that

251
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,750
a lot of times there's this

252
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,390
cost-benefit

253
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,060
yes we can cut taxes every single state
controversy politeness to work

254
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,519
we can make sure we have several cameras
security people at the door

255
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,850
check your bags stuff like that

256
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,600
we can do this and some stories that you
electron source pearce-lance

257
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,530
there's a possible see what's going on

258
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,510
not only cut the cost of the personnel
and equipment to run that type of system

259
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,220
but also the cost of

260
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,020
you know i said in the person that's
your occupation

261
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,170
so

262
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,300
so we'll talk about cost-benefit
tradeoffs and i think that in stores is

263
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,040
there's often rinpoches

264
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,630
at least up

265
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,430
purposes that would make some plans

266
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,500
that we can do better

267
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,280
brocade level lost work for

268
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,380
are air force yourself no break and even
acts

269
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,389
a lot of time

270
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,080
questions simple questions like

271
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,840
can this go on playing

272
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,380
because i have to do it and find out

273
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,560
all and i thank you

274
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,540
record i credit reports that the
direction

275
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,248
under it

276
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,660
easy to pick them up

277
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,350
because they'd surely be such a

278
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,440
workshop

279
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,730
of on

280
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,639
of meeting

281
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,810
the needs when we'd like to have these
things are here

282
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,190
the uh... the risk is so high

283
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,720
the costs are ready to sell high in
terms of inconvenience during some point

284
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,410
that

285
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,709
that exchange for all that effort

286
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,679
we should have a very high level of
security

287
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,240
and act as we know

288
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,210
it's not so good

289
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,269
okay that's salutes you getting it

290
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,990
papa example with

291
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,350
with the uh... conference to just
examples of where i think uh...

292
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,850
uh... there's is there's a strong
obscure component to the basics

293
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,710
what we have to secure

294
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,750
so we wanted systems more secure or try
to talk about on digital systems a

295
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,890
little bit more digital examples

296
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,490
and we'd like a bunch of different
things and

297
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,230
keywords verification trust one-half

298
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,300
on some sort of data integrity or verify
ability

299
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,310
we want to have not heard creation

300
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,020
are legion

301
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,260
digital world

302
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,040
is uh... about

303
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,900
judicial signatures and stuff like that

304
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,320
but again you have a lot world in the
the physical world we'd say hey

305
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,890
that you were you were into

306
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,890
times you wonder why not

307
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,030
and dinosaurs were feature that's fine

308
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:47,050
reassure ourselves everything

309
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,500
an example of your although security
people are in this audience apply

310
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,060
familiar with the d_o_d_ orange book via

311
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,649
thing that gives the ratings of that and
see if you would see one detour

312
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,380
the one so forth

313
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,310
for our security

314
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,450
clearances are securities or
authorizations

315
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,470
of jesus

316
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,159
and that's now of course for you update
me up talk tickets today

317
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,410
with the uh... open-source security
model and excited about the kinds

318
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,980
we need better models processing
judicial system

319
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,460
but he went on to something that you
you're unlikely to breath

320
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,430
well they have their basically

321
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,380
something where the effort for the cost
goes up

322
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,980
and security goes up

323
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,060
and people are interested in the system
will say that about me

324
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,380
uh... organization or a school of
business

325
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,189
and say all right

326
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,000
as i go out this feeling dot

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,410
more more security in the orange book
levels were routinely

328
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,310
text since it's a used to

329
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,720
greater security

330
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,570
of my cost a lot because it costs were
right i might have to have been peace

331
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,090
carrie personnel

332
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,749
the actual software hardware might cost
more

333
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,360
i dedicate more my part

334
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,100
disk space itself today

335
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,270
at a higher levels

336
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,640
as he made a decision resistance
worthwhile

337
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,430
and actually let me mention because at
the top of the worked with a lot of

338
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,709
people on bizarre citizens of this error
when i first saw

339
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,089
is the a levels

340
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,600
and that the a level

341
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,650
what happens is you have arm

342
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,680
uh... what they call a watchable proof

343
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,399
that there is security

344
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,170
so it's not that it's uh... ah shards
but it's not that someone tells me this

345
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,280
is ok

346
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,650
is that you can actually sit down with a
you know a lot of system

347
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,829
that model

348
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,840
about that exceeds

349
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,180
vacation stuff

350
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,609
or or some other benefit

351
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:37,260
and prove to yourself

352
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,780
what you don't want to happen

353
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,640
so we do have some pretty good models
and i think to release a very good

354
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,790
models of the spirit world

355
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,939
did visual world visual site

356
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,150
for processing

357
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,240
spirit

358
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,440
uh... as i said i'll ask your systems
that are like me

359
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,640
allah stronger through their security

360
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,149
there'd need possibly

361
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:00,710
more difficult to more time-consuming

362
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,990
probable politically although it is all
there

363
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,910
in most cases

364
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,649
and i think what i'll do as a little bit
of a a hard line to make but but we're

365
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,690
going to talk about superseded dvd
worthwhile

366
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,070
a security guard

367
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,550
and on the other hand saying obscurity
there's a problem

368
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,720
and of course experience secrecy are

369
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,939
rpm really upset

370
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,640
the same thing to stop

371
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,720
aberration villains disdain

372
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,990
but uh...

373
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,600
i think the idea

374
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,500
is your procedure in place instead
secrecy fits in with the whole procedure

375
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,690
you can assure yourself that yes this is
good

376
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,740
verses do you have really no insurance
advisor procedure and all we can do is

377
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,000
open or finds out every secrets

378
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,860
so i hope that's that's not too
difficult to uh... to use those two

379
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,870
words they're but i think it's a

380
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,320
is not realistic

381
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,910
possibly alternative courses something
like we have an open source uh...

382
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,030
unscrewed

383
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,990
body

384
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,999
personnel

385
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,059
individuals

386
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,339
papi yes

387
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,120
really anybody might be able to find a
vulnerability

388
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,640
yes in the trigger world

389
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,850
a lot of time the cryptology side of
that looking at

390
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,699
out of the stuff like that

391
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,799
they're pretty highly trained uh... i a
lot of mathematics

392
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,460
shot back

393
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,839
ob gyn might work in teams involved
seizures

394
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,859
so these are real professionals experts

395
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,190
but that doesn't mean better not
personal not expert couldn't find

396
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,760
problems wells related

397
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,360
computer labs in here

398
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
uh... you know people on some level of
expertise but they're not

399
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,610
you know they're not

400
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,930
that's a professional's people that
would be

401
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,630
contracting out of hired to do a
securities that's been so i think more

402
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,570
more than ever

403
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,169
more people are looking at

404
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,400
maranda back as i said it might be
transferred to retire

405
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,460
outmoded alarms but the sources crypto

406
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,990
and down

407
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,350
and uh... as i said that the more the
merrier for doing so

408
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,469
this examination

409
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,910
and so question you might ask at this
point as well get over red rock with

410
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,140
obscurity

411
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,760
armies that fought say they are

412
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,100
trying to say

413
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,540
obscurity itself is not enough because
the people that you really want prevent

414
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,590
other people are going to be able to
work towards that

415
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,439
especially insiders

416
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,130
especially your

417
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,340
his intruders

418
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,389
fraught makers whether it is a you're
really trying to keep out of the

419
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,210
security

420
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,480
uh... that we have more people working
what what we hear all the time to read

421
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,100
by the track meet slashdot digital world

422
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,290
at all times in your book

423
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,409
and there's no extra step of it

424
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,500
and people with source code hostile you
asap

425
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,800
actually people of the source code
hustle

426
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,159
you get out how to fix that you've got a
quite right

427
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,309
and by the time people are exploiting

428
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:56,080
that security hole

429
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,039
people he said that when i'm paul

430
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,340
are able to get them to get access to
your

431
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,699
in the obscure world

432
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,440
we might be faced with god nobody being
able to identify involved

433
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,310
who is waiting to happen acted we helped
me capability without the explains

434
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,270
because a person that works for the
obscurity by

435
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,240
and of course that the other ideas

436
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,280
uh... visual began throughout source
code however liquidation

437
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,430
dash something since the open-source

438
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,850
so this is where we think the
open-source

439
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,570
where does your security

440
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,510
uh... advice

441
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:40,510
to be learned from

442
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,910
so more people

443
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,159
will grow up

444
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,510
foresee any problems

445
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,289
and mike

446
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:50,990
tension always actor

447
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,770
but very large

448
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,300
percentage of

449
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,270
with the skills the interest

450
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,639
and so forth to engage in

451
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,460
at new england

452
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,070
dot maybe possibly healthy

453
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,590
yuppie possibly healthy skepticism

454
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,860
and stuff like that

455
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,520
but out by the people in this room that
five or italy or not

456
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,410
in my opinion

457
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,350
and my experience very likely

458
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,170
to be the people that go to bed

459
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,430
you're trying to go on saturday

460
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,350
target cells find decent

461
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,580
and yes there are some

462
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,669
but as a percentage of bus antiquated
send is one of the general public

463
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,210
probably not right so if the percentages

464
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:42,890
wave in favor of people that have no one
wants

465
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,590
you're really interested they're
discovers being useful and candid

466
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,520
that were coming out ahead

467
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,620
they were coming out ahead

468
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,550
as i say that people with ill intent

469
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,270
are are going to work hard

470
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,800
so it was or software

471
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,110
uh... as we know

472
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,940
sometimes open-source software as they
saw open standards so we can actually

473
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,580
look at them

474
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,060
adulterous office would find them

475
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,870
and if we had a source code

476
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,380
could also do a drop of doing testing

477
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,800
if want to enforce it

478
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,520
that situation but if you want to go
ahead set up a more formal test

479
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,908
of that

480
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,050
but that's awful

481
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,800
and we actually see happening

482
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,070
yet the types of companies and
individuals

483
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,049
as as i say i i think it was pretty well

484
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,110
the committee's these couple of other
uh...

485
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,710
except when we don't miss a thing and
bought a small print there which is that

486
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,100
the entire

487
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,880
number bucks in software

488
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,290
statistically is more or less consistant

489
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,210
with the ont-size

490
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,540
this is just something

491
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,430
computer scientist at work too

492
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,580
mathematical models of work pretty well

493
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,799
they've done curable you know
measurements of

494
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,049
number bugs

495
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,570
and what we're talking about

496
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,679
uh... rusty nails something like one of
my profound

497
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,120
novels but savimbi security related or
something to be processed related

498
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,600
you know caught some sort of

499
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,390
uh... malfunction cost

500
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,950
sedona security about

501
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,510
but if we talk about on the average us
tonight want but the thousand lines but

502
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,470
thats

503
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,710
through the evaluation

504
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,890
theory by professional

505
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,850
that if we have

506
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,050
thousands or millions of lines of code
which we do

507
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,050
the complex software systems

508
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,550
we're talking about thousands of players

509
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,810
thousands of bucks okay

510
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,720
those thousands of bugs are going to be
there complex opp operating system

511
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,280
well we don't get the source code

512
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
they're going to be there

513
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,450
unix operating system internals

514
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,850
or we can get source

515
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,950
the differences how we all have also
other look at them

516
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:58,860
and also force was to proceed

517
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,780
now there are ways to follow up on a
little bit there are ways to decrease

518
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,580
the number of books

519
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,090
decreasing bugs used three tests

520
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,129
to set up a a a

521
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,120
basically regression

522
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,920
sweet where you make changes to the code

523
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,030
you've got all your test to make sure
you pass health that's what happens to

524
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,120
be tereko gmail

525
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,410
benefits one bug

526
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,190
you create a radio covered up

527
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,920
so it's not good enough to you

528
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,940
run the test

529
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,330
fixing bugs you can't

530
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,840
and ship the products that being said

531
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,590
statements remain

532
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,699
it better procedure is right here
testing cycle drug test

533
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,900
the sexism

534
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,830
and maybe do this war of words might

535
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,770
we very complex systems

536
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,960
you are suddenly unable q test
everything you need to test

537
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,160
your resolve period of time

538
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,900
and pick up the expensive

539
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,850
she would look at the output of the test
decide what to do with the site design

540
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,899
young fixes to solve these problems like
serious especially in europe

541
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:56,830
erations

542
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,080
and improve things so terribly happy
about

543
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,340
of understanding from companies like but
software boats that

544
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,399
it's not a big software

545
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:07,840
is so

546
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,060
they do a few erations

547
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,909
three four five

548
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,480
what happens with the bugs

549
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,360
is there is lots of it

550
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,560
updates as they sit talking ever get rid
of all

551
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,879
period that you never claimed the cotton
ball acceptance of lots of soccer

552
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,070
systems

553
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,710
and as you keep falling

554
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,019
you keep getting rid of world war two
points

555
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:34,600
accept this mission returns

556
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,330
the problems

557
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,600
of course that's a cut off right uh...
this is this is an acceptable

558
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,890
coffeehouse

559
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,240
i think my bottle eliminated some

560
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,160
eighty or ninety percent

561
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,820
started this process

562
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,300
the problem is

563
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,399
you know what software system that will
take a look at it for soviet bloc

564
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:54,640
this could be of service

565
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,880
maybe more

566
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,510
history

567
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,830
so

568
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,580
so you can do u testing to get that was
errors down

569
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,129
but could never be able to make sure

570
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,620
begets more expensive seventy so far

571
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,900
open-source

572
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,220
you carry out that quite ubiquitous a
problem that will be another problem

573
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,810
that you might not have the same
infrastructure doing

574
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,850
obstruction estimates

575
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,550
however

576
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,480
how much progress with it going

577
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,890
to go through the bob

578
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:30,030
so we c_e_o_ software like

579
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,810
ambivalence colonel charlie

580
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,889
yes why

581
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,130
it releases and saying

582
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,760
with what about fences so we see it a
lot of effort

583
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,730
releases

584
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,040
i think this would work just fine

585
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,090
jackpot

586
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,550
possibly work better

587
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,790
because they had software system

588
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:55,549
you might have billions or

589
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,519
complex operating system

590
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,120
into a store

591
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,920
you know we talked

592
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,730
ten twenty percent

593
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,419
different you know

594
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,720
to me it's a much more practical problem

595
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,940
and you could actually have

596
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,360
we'd solution

597
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,940
software

598
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,570
on accomplices

599
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,320
assurance ever really

600
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,730
that is fine

601
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,220
uh... secretary mentioned trip there
already

602
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,400
uh... with crypto

603
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,690
you have no security

604
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,980
at least as far as the critical

605
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,060
communities concern maybe within

606
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,740
visa retrieved

607
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,510
decisions right but as far as the crypto

608
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,870
experts are concerned

609
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,750
you don't have to do with her and
recruiting

610
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,510
until your process

611
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,690
probably our algorithms endure

612
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,660
and the outcome of your doubts this is
an expert's analysis of that hundred

613
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,750
has been exam

614
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,340
closely by experts

615
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,940
if you go to read any literature books
pick up like to talk to you by shire

616
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,150
or are

617
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,700
they'd look through some of the uh...

618
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,400
publication picked up

619
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,370
people still wonder criticisms that use

620
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,840
for thirty years

621
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,310
anyhow

622
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,460
undiscovered

623
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,590
problems every once in while they
discover one

624
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,470
i like the one

625
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,790
uh... we heard that job problem pgp

626
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,190
a little while ago pgp adolescence my
pap yesterday pgp pretty good privacy

627
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:34,430
and kids are system

628
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,309
email files and so forth

629
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:39,660
is not as pretty good it's really really
good because it's been excessively

630
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,030
revived started out pretty

631
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,970
a pretty good

632
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,580
called the culprit yet right

633
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,428
but what it said that this person

634
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,620
patient pgp

635
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,510
very serious plots

636
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,090
but it's gone through you know something
like twenty years revisions to me

637
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,090
and yet

638
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,000
this year

639
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,979
art there was a serious problem

640
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:05,979
that wasn't covered

641
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,860
the whole thing exactly

642
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,200
the whole thing dot blotting

643
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,020
surrender

644
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,440
parents recruiter trip produced by
michael their careers at all of your

645
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,470
question

646
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,600
yet what is basically the ethical system
because we are americans and the

647
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,820
implementation of the other the might be
sad

648
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,320
there might be something else going on

649
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,840
and apparently yesterday we talked about
the uh...

650
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,810
the fact that dr

651
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,708
windows system you have anything that's

652
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:33,600
invulnerable

653
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,160
sorry intolerable

654
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,149
in windows system to cope with in
addition to your own self

655
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:43,930
our children

656
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,670
all right

657
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,250
uh... i'm still not only about the are
consistent with the criticism

658
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,320
and so too

659
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,070
years ago that was the clipper chip in
particular

660
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:59,290
and it was a shared with me in fact
uh... they had to leave viewers look at

661
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,080
the algorithm

662
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,889
and even as a ship since they were given
enough time

663
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:08,500
but uh... but was moved to texas

664
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,299
yet review review review itself

665
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,070
enough time to do the review

666
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,929
and ongoing review because up

667
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,860
improved over and i think this would
this happen

668
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,340
go across the board

669
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,700
is uh... you know

670
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,610
people's you got my faith in god

671
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,700
note that the club

672
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,370
yes iraq i personally think that that
uh... that it's usually have crypto

673
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,820
there

674
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,610
uh... pgp

675
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,890
uh... software that's just got better
and better and better

676
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,000
it's really easy to use your daughter

677
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,139
junkets we can talk about

678
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:50,890
but uh... as far as

679
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,140
by than you think

680
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,350
good examples of things that p_c_p_ is
supposed to be made

681
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,620
we think it's not able to

682
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,570
are we able to

683
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,200
passages

684
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,250
it steps up to get a test

685
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,209
uh... allotted on twitter com i wanted
to mention

686
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,630

you're interested

688
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,500
redeployed photography but

689
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,840
regardless of

690
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,860
any of your interest must read secrets
and lots

691
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,789
is now standing but

692
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,399
website starts out with

693
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,780
in that book

694
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,530
for the press

695
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,760
he says

696
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,220
his

697
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,560
thought when you look like the park

698
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,080
the closest thing we have to buy votes

699
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,909
who won close to one of one of the few
books and intelligence up there

700
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,580
what he said was that he thought crypto
was the answer

701
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,949
and it turned out that there was only
part of the

702
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,040
and you have to look at the whole order
system

703
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,620
luggage tried to do

704
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,000
with security mess with the book is
about

705
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,570
schematic

706
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,678
actually presents

707
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,940
applied for copies of the classified
pensioner

708
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,429
and secrets and lies visits to your book
i think it's

709
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:10,120
because of two thousand

710
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,130
are released

711
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,410
her its

712
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,140
mike boorda was line

713
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,100
what

714
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,820
property

715
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,389
writes that since property reports

716
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,000
i sound like he doesn't represent what
size bottles are owned by love to talk

717
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,120
first

718
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,830
it's more like

719
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,330
the bible of people of one of the sailor

720
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,490

722
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,380
i did not come up with what time

723
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,290
in twenty dollars

724
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,010
whatever dollar bills coming up

725
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,680
we saw some newspaper article said what
old security procedures

726
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,540
i didn't see that

727
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,899
and told it was done

728
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:00,900
about thinking of a lot of examples ob
and i want to help me to try to press on

729
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:08,350
we have tonight uh... robert skills of
the song last night on

730
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,250
are he's going to

731
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,190
at nine o'clock

732
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,210
public several

733
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,679
spots you know

734
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,390
is uh... an expat

735
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,840
he's got all this inside information

736
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,950
ekeus fighting his life's mission yes
institute yet

737
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,700
books he's talking here's socket

738
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,450
is to say

739
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,630
government it specially but the other
agencies businesses as well

740
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,040
that secret

741
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,690
effective

742
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,440
too costly

743
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,620
too difficult

744
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,280
and evro

745
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,410
really utilize

746
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,840
the vast majority of cases he's not
saying shit you know secrecy

747
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,600
he's saying is way way too much secrecy
it's possible see what it is not the

748
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,950
effectiveness create problem

749
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,960
and so forth that successful

750
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,450
install argument

751
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,950
so he's out

752
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,130
he's a big proponent

753
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,760
decreasing obscurity

754
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,560
indivisible

755
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,210
respond

756
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,710
procedures

757
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,090
agencies and things like that

758
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,830
okay so this is applied here right

759
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,080
one route towards the hope of reviewers

760
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,970
like an open source i model

761
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,510
of uh... security agency

762
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,110
this world

763
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,289
as i say that for all the other

764
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:28,429
official qualified people do it which

765
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:30,210
for some reason might be appropriate

766
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,040
uh... that losing out

767
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,950
and uh... as a

768
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,270
that same secure dot cc might be a

769
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,889
and as i've been saying

770
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:42,470
any results basically

771
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,400
janet's life here is

772
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,820
thus up up and talk about

773
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,639
digital read-out

774
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,710
this program

775
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,480
and this is shire slide

776
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,220
okay this is this not exactly advances
were less type of uh...

777
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,470
seizure grassroots secrets and lies

778
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,130
he says

779
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,100
it's a system

780
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,549
it's a security system

781
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,120
it's a system that exists in time

782
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,850
space is a system that interacts with
some outside barber

783
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,089
this is an active waldholtz people

784
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,659
communication

785
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,340
things like that just begun

786
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,519
hardware and software

787
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,999
and uh... so i think this works really
well for the

788
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:21,379
of our coordinator soulless what could
go wrong

789
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:22,828
one of the things were worried about

790
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,489
what are we trying to protect

791
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,999
of what is a procedure that we have

792
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:33,119
uh... as i said i think that uh... today
yet but try not to buy a report airports

793
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,249
know what cedras lifetime

794
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:37,769
or changes certainly can't find out

795
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:42,199
and i'm just last week i call the shots
bt airline safety tips

796
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,679
okay bring this out playing

797
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,899
there was no answer forthcoming

798
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,549
there wasn't a yes or no it's just that
you know it was here's what you're

799
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,569
allowed to do and and

800
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:56,808
at interpretation of what's allows up to
that

801
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:59,169
where the perception over after that

802
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:04,109
plane someone x right back

803
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:08,629
the content of the last important
because there are costly expert

804
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:12,118
you might want to do backer costs
involved setting up the whole security

805
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:12,979
process

806
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:14,740
and at some point by what's that about

807
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,689
but nothing else is this looks pretty
good pretty good stuff

808
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:21,500
always start talks about a whole lot

809
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,560
i think people about

810
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,629
marxist dance traders that her out
getting packers tools

811
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:29,089
on here's isn't

812
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:31,439
think like the person trying to break a
nuisance

813
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:34,089
try to use of the samples

814
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:37,769
we actually see that's about the
airports

815
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,379
undercover floats through

816
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:42,459
ought to see if they could bypass
procedures

817
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:44,640
this would be great

818
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,109
they were getting better at

819
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:48,609
not be able to bypass that

820
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,400
still has a lot of problems

821
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,680
to insist on steroids getting out there

822
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,859
repeated just like i said

823
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:57,788
reduced number of

824
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,099
about sourcebook

825
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:04,549
uh... so restore what are the risks with
players got some stuff about customers

826
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:05,180
for that

827
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,888
repeat what we have

828
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:08,689
poppies curie people generally

829
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:11,129
employees we have no

830
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,979
you know we have contractors mike

831
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:15,410
compile-time

832
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,239
was a procedure that we got got
countless cargo was right or would not

833
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,469
want to do that

834
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:25,179
apart that's telephones here and there
was a little bit of change

835
00:36:25,179 --> 00:36:26,520
until we get ready

836
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,849
things like that

837
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:31,359
were you talked to know what it was
being sold

838
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,659
who lost his job

839
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,019
that were worried about

840
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:39,349
i like the others might just be
despaired catherine sir

841
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,119
expensive items or what

842
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,329
our inventory doesn't seem to match we
don't really know what's what

843
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,380
and all those things are going on

844
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,430
what we do a street maps and stuff

845
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,598
that my dress of those problems

846
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,240
what's assess how well

847
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,709
intended solution

848
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:01,348
my dress

849
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:05,389
sort of reality check

850
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,759
and im go ahead

851
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,739
come up with the details

852
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:11,739
deployed some

853
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:14,729
some reasonable time scale denial once

854
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:18,539
and uh... i know they say

855
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,259
if you're not a value

856
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:23,569
expiry system

857
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:24,779
might be good

858
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:29,019
right might not be good and i hope
weightier is and i i don't know the

859
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,960
media stories is really

860
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,219
in need of putting up their whole
procedure

861
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:35,309
on uh... people six people to know

862
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:42,169
it's a walk-in

863
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:43,828
might work for

864
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,140
if part of it is

865
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,940
to stick it out

866
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,909
yeltsin's that got the side that says

867
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,849
people we have tactics

868
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:58,129
process was actually do

869
00:37:58,129 --> 00:37:59,288
i think that might help

870
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:01,929
but i think the

871
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:06,309
get their procedure allen therefore
sleeping on their website

872
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:08,539
conference in a trade show

873
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:12,319
uh... you know what happened with
consultants

874
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:15,129
let's talk about other one uh...

875
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,710
the deal here

876
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,989
we thank you katie

877
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:20,390
as i said i was involved with the uh...
planet

878
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,319
conference

879
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:23,759
and what they can do is fairly early on

880
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:29,259
was that as one of the fires

881
00:38:29,259 --> 00:38:31,689
had no idea

882
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,999
shirts securities firms

883
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:37,349
i realized earlier

884
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:40,559
right

885
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:46,069
and when things were worried about these
cards are actually pretty good reports

886
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:51,109
making something that looks like this
and that has been sold fifty dollar bill

887
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:52,989
this is what gets me

888
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:54,669
soho

889
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:56,170
so in that procedure

890
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,640
there's uh... and the whole sources said
there

891
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,308
there was about who secrecy component

892
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,749
that was effective

893
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,599
the main reason it was effective

894
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,009
it's finally

895
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:09,239
what we were basically saying

896
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:12,700
by keeping secrets all no thursday night
friday

897
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,289
what particular colors itself it's that
white wine

898
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:19,480
forts to save himself at the box might
possibly sell

899
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,069
get told friends

900
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:24,239
possibly create a revenue problem

901
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,239
if we just keep it secret teleconference

902
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,449
uh... i don't want that pays out
fighting haven't sent it

903
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:32,649
i want to do this

904
00:39:32,649 --> 00:39:34,410
and there's only one or two days

905
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,598
friends with that

906
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,619
so that's where it is the secrecy worked

907
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:40,599
barbara

908
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,419
for example

909
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,959
but we think secrecy work

910
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:46,919
on top of the bases as part of our
security bob

911
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,429
address that issue

912
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,660
to sketch expected

913
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,109
colors with teachers

914
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:58,129
that we did not become a lot of public
scrutiny for this

915
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:02,038
ob gyn think that if i would be
perfectly appropriate

916
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,730
we got us out under pollack mailing list
for more scrutiny

917
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,629
we didn't do as far as of now

918
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:09,169
we might have identified

919
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:12,179
interest in it

920
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:15,269
they probably would have had some some
pretty good

921
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:17,829
uh... as it was it was at least um...

922
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,669
uh... the scrutiny of the uh...

923
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,158
or trying to come up with it

924
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,579
singers

925
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:28,809
okay so we don't have a security
challenges we know that

926
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,159
things like security guards of cameras
are physical stuff

927
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,039
might be more possibly an

928
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,669
uh... more costly to scale

929
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,719
possible additional sisterhood

930
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:46,719
and of course we also down

931
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:51,368
and i've argued

932
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:52,690
you know through out here

933
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,049
that i think that's about reviewing
security process in different places

934
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,809
we have the web

935
00:40:58,809 --> 00:40:59,859
we don't have to have

936
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:02,219
no posters and walk through

937
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:04,829
of astonishment seemed to uh...

938
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:09,959
you know to get some feedback that might
help

939
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:14,109
our webpage for for us to work

940
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:16,319
military base

941
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,529
uh... together dot

942
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:22,739
people have stuffing

943
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:24,089
picture people

944
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:30,919
students say they are

945
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:36,999
to reiterate party insiders are often
the biggest risk even personal security

946
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,369
dextrous

947
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,249
on in the physical world

948
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:43,079
uh... overhearing is about all the stuff

949
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,059
white-collar criminals stealing billions
and billions from

950
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:49,609
stockholders of companies

951
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:51,788
i would be that they were inside

952
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:53,369
they were not sent

953
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:54,739
tickets to be

954
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:57,119
might even see coming out of all of the
house

955
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,849
uh... and on and follow along

956
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,059
might see something like some public
scrutiny

957
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,939
sumter county south

958
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,999
soledad a bridge between the visible

959
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,919
visual world dispersal counted sounds
like fun

960
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,799
and yet where you can four

961
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:18,129
goods and services

962
00:42:18,129 --> 00:42:20,519
so uh... so that's just my stride

963
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:23,829
do this uh... let's split c_e_o_ suggest

964
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:28,109
we can't even be about seizure work

965
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:29,038
adapting

966
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,429
some of what we have

967
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:33,169
indiana

968
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:35,999
due to the world that's really think
work very well

969
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:37,719
t_v_ out here

970
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,389
that we have

971
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:44,799
better security in our physical realm

972
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:46,189
very big pink

973
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:52,538
in our last about six or eight months

974
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:54,249
he keeps the program

975
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:57,109
lose about this

976
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:00,219
so that's why i by email

977
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,130
my personal webpage

978
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,699
value could not be suggest by

979
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:06,689
expanding network television

980
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:07,999
first-order five

981
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,149
misidentified major problems

982
00:43:10,149 --> 00:43:14,749
we have are probably about five minutes
for questions of what we like to ask

983
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:16,679
sports the packers

984
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,859
if you have one at the keepers for a
little bit more

985
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:26,859
and if there are no questions we can
properly

986
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,788
i think we're going to have a little
children

987
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:36,589
secrecy stirred

988
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:41,359
i'd like to see

989
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,230
i don't know of any kind of good

990
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,589
uh... security system doesn't bounce
internship secret

991
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:50,839
you you've got to have similar ones are
a lot of some visualizer object that is

992
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,389
not something that that nobody else is
that no except

993
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:56,669
two-thirds of the dayton today

994
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:59,459
um... but then obscurity isn't it

995
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:02,019
it's perhaps a different

996
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,809
the fact that secret sucks

997
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,419
is being skewered

998
00:44:06,419 --> 00:44:08,989
and uh... but in a series of

999
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:10,909
david litchfield came up with

1000
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:13,709
box office tools

1001
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:18,888
just a simple uh... password pastel
cracker packed at g_t_o_

1002
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,899
and when he discovered was that they

1003
00:44:20,899 --> 00:44:25,009
lucas alternative

1004
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:27,529
but that wasn't done

1005
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:30,679
what you had with him

1006
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,839
souls were not

1007
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,369
large enough in the certainly weren't
rent

1008
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:41,739
your you handed the very bleak

1009
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:45,579
so that obscurity it seems to be the
effort

1010
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:49,189
to provide some of them are already out
how bad something it's great secret

1011
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,388
itself has got to be there absolute

1012
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,959
uh... basil attitude

1013
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,368
people are always using

1014
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:58,039
obscurity in secrecy interchangeable

1015
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:01,159
use these very difficult to speed up

1016
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:02,989
star quality

1017
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:05,679
yeah i mean i i think that's what it
means is that huh

1018
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,429
well you know this is what i said i
don't think roe versus wade one zero

1019
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:11,679
zero so to argument at all

1020
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,199
and you wanted to see to it

1021
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,539
and i think one distinctions that's
fairly easy to make

1022
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:20,450
is whatever

1023
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,079
mihir data

1024
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:22,899
once a year

1025
00:45:22,899 --> 00:45:24,788
obscuring data

1026
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,930
or information

1027
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,979
really talked about seizure

1028
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,519
there are only i think

1029
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:34,880
advanced skills are

1030
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:41,880
some cases where there needs to be an
element of secrecy to your procedure

1031
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:45,779
expects a trip to the people off

1032
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:48,579
if you don't want

1033
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:54,069
process

1034
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:57,549
effective

1035
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,769
peeps in town

1036
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:01,529
if you are the system

1037
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,169
doesn't survive

1038
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:04,899
people going

1039
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:08,919
uh... where the cameras are your sister
mrs

1040
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:11,908
right and i would like to use it

1041
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:18,909
situation

1042
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:22,219
sophocles

1043
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:24,069
if it works

1044
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:31,069
revenue uniform telling us

1045
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,209
secrets out of

1046
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:37,819
e astrophys isaacson

1047
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:41,369
spinscape com

1048
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:43,009
whites have one more question

1049
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,859
accuses the president during the filming
this

1050
00:46:45,859 --> 00:46:48,159
not known if the school

1051
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,269
basically correct you're sustaining
missions trip

1052
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:56,969
basically you see the explanation

1053
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:00,519
meet source code

1054
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:04,519
i think one of things now

1055
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:07,180
keeping in mind that's political

1056
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:14,180
it's a lot of

1057
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:24,549
it's to someone

1058
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:25,529
uh... basically

1059
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:28,239
he probably

1060
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,459
eat interferes with their business model

1061
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:38,459
intel and microsoft and its or school

1062
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:53,169
lots of company

1063
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:58,909
anta mindset and i think that it was the
last i think that there are some things

1064
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,719
that means you don't use it

1065
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:03,639
really believed it was

1066
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:07,129
potentially about the civil

1067
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:10,889
still provide words companies

1068
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:17,859
you change your consistently

1069
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:22,229
until support will have been told me

1070
00:48:22,229 --> 00:48:25,839
weapons

1071
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,890
i think this is that i i'm absolutely

1072
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,029
agree with you but i think in the
physical world

1073
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:37,909
it's not quite that much is it

1074
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:39,599
could be bought himself

1075
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,169
in those cases

1076
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:45,919
but you're usually make your own
security

1077
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:50,629
so i think it actually there is some

1078
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:53,479
they don't necessarily need a trade-off

1079
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:57,749
cider higher independent

1080
00:48:57,749 --> 00:48:59,609
they don't necessarily have to say well

1081
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:04,419
under close doors are open source said

1082
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:07,078
darkness at that point

1083
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,269
