1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,859
world

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:13,859
used

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,150
well thank everybody for coming and
after that wonderful speech ever bring

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,890
it back a little bit more towards a

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,970
the technical and professional hacker
I'm

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,829
thanks a lot on my presentation today on
discussing professional hacking

7
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,620
I am particularly coming home security
testing professional hacker such as

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,399
yourselves

9
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,409
can interface with utilizing contribute
to

10
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:48,409
the open-source testing methodology
mando also known as the Oscar normally

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,030
these presentations about two hours long
but due to time constraints

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,699
have to squeeze in about 40 minutes so
if I go too fast we need additional

13
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,670
information please make no they asked me
at the end

14
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,810
Q&A session so that we can get through
it all at the end I'm

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,640
also be available after the presentation
of drugs remain at the conference so

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,880
three Grammy ask questions so the
audience I have here at this conference

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,929
is very broadly folks are the entire
game better security professionals

18
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:21,050
now the sasser's turnout technology
visionaries

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,179
malicious hackers federal agents
security professionals as the

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,890
administrators we got the whole thing
here

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,159
I'm it makes it very difficult for me to
attempt to make these presentations that

22
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,079
all those levels

23
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,420
so they're most likely be partially me
too technical for some folks in some

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,579
parts that are impor-

25
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,299
some almost a view so please bear with
me if this happens

26
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm and we can get together more
question there so these are the topics

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,770
that i'm gonna cover

28
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,060
overview of the security testing
profession and the Austin South

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,340
the session will include a brief
analysis on the security testing field

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,360
today as well as background on the idea
and organization that houses the Oscar

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,340
i dnt originated the idea for the ask
them

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,340
and I'll also give it back and ask
himself from there a real briefly touch

33
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,369
on privacy law

34
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,940
and how the awesome tries to properly
respond to as many

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,049
laws internationally as possible then
we'll get an immediate

36
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,810
presentation at the section title
planning lost on security task is

37
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,350
obvious with a certain about the whole
or in some detail the testing process

38
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,840
that has to be covered to be an awesome
certified

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,699
past and always knew that often results
in final Q&A

40
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:34,260
for just what the hell is an awesome
anyhow

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,030
me take a step back into

42
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,120
give you a little background on myself
and right after the knowledge transfer

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,400
project W

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,430
organization been involved with it since
its inception in January 2001

45
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,750
basically this just made us tonight I'm
getting out how to get the word out

46
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,350
about

47
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,448
our project and are open source manuals
to people like themselves

48
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,220
but the hamsters not a profit-making
companies or organizations that were

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,199
house for open source projects that

50
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,579
so all the travel lodging everything
that are all parts for these

51
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,199
presentations to you guys to try to

52
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,989
just get people signed up and and help
this thing grow I'm also a primary

53
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,340
contributor to the ass myself an iPod
and many other models and getting

54
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,990
significant feedback and very process of
me

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,600
%um and profound Republican security
Sciences Corporation

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,540
as well as a freelance security
consultant both government programs

57
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,530
the ID his organization

58
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,350
as an organization dedicated to the
development of security standards the

59
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,950
open the review process

60
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,470
the organization is an independent
third-party receive no money or benefits

61
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,230
for many

62
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,010
commercial means anyone's life becoming
criticizing tripp grady

63
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,260
projects or submit realized

64
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,390
whether or not product become the
standard is purely up to peer review an

65
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,290
overall acceptance turnout commercial
non-political needs

66
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,160
means you guys make these things really
does make these things grow and become

67
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,049
solid risk analyst January 2001 is
simply a small idea

68
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,630
we like the hamster on Fri in many
projects throughout over well as the

69
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,450
project is always growing in a state of
flux currently we have

70
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,140
the open source security testing
methodology manual the 10 min to talk

71
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,940
about today

72
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,320
the jack-of-all-trades security testing
training supplement was the technical

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,399
training supplement to the awesome
itself

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,490
the secure programming standards
methodology manual

75
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,630
which is a supplement to the asking for
the development of security code for

76
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,920
Internet applications and some hospitals
are also in development

77
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,180
these tools are all TDL tools in our
release the open source to support the

78
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,310
adoption and we ask them

79
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,240
all idea after project meeting a simple
things around in information security

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,700
and best practices

81
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,490
all documents written using open peer
review process which allows all

82
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,190
professionals in the field to comment
and/or review

83
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,330
each other's comments for inclusion in
the docking at the hamster cell

84
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,900
is independent non-political non-profit
simply the organization of the peer

85
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,110
review process the coordination in the
data

86
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,450
and hosting them all the information the
rest is up to you guess

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,940
so we ask them products

88
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,340
the open source security testing
methodology many law schools the first

89
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,700
the most widely accepted standard in the
development for the security testing

90
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,520
internet systems and networks been
downloaded by over a million individuals

91
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,330
worldwide since its inception

92
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,820
with a lot of collaborators and probably
been translated into five different

93
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,370
languages

94
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,370
the ass literally expression experts
liberation have expert knowledge

95
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,950
the ass move rapidly becoming a standard
for security testing industry-wide

96
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,890
has been adopted by a good portion of
the company's the test Internet Security

97
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,020
mainly because methodology is so solid

98
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,969
since they're over over 100 meters from
other companies agencies and was like

99
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,010
the Oscars truly emerging information
the single best practices document

100
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,219
yes the spring ninety three pages of
information checklist and templates I

101
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,380
have a heart heavy with me if anybody
wants to see it

102
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,540
the hassle of is a certification seal
for those who complete a thorough

103
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,750
security test according to specific
sections of the media room

104
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,340
there will your customers know the
difficulty the task for the best

105
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,400
practices in mind and they can see the
methodology used to do those tests

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,880
as legal best practice in commercial
information changes

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,210
and shared amongst the security
community it will get incorporated into

108
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,840
the osco

109
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,610
the stories of greater number of
templates and a help accelerate the

110
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,060
security testing process

111
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,340
new models are being added even today to
deal with emerging technology as well as

112
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,080
obscure

113
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,340
optional facets testing since this is a
living document the Assamese

114
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,729
professionals like yourselves to
contribute I'm an idea for the project

115
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:50,729
help us continue to help the security
community

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,750
all right as we all know the stats
computer security breaches are on the

117
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,160
rise another boring with a little
boasted about

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,520
eighty-five percent respondents detected
blah blah blah like crap

119
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,969
we all know what's going on we also know
that the senate companies acclaim

120
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,330
financial losses going on

121
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,109
well what can we do tell you guys a
security professionals to bring down

122
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,030
those debts

123
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,710
we formulate a standard for test that is
always updated

124
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,400
always current always being reviewed by
the practitioners themselves

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,320
and we take the standard mg/dl we have
many companies organizations and

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,580
agencies donating their time and some
human resources to the arts

127
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,780
one example would be the US Department
treasures US

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,900
Department of Treasury officer threat
there are other examples including MITRE

129
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,000
Corporation da Vinci consulting their
sign in for

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,590
by the early adopters in the ass these
companies recognize that offers

131
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,520
participants a consistent framework and
clearly quantifiable results

132
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,690
thereby affording a level of assurance
that the output file

133
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,169
accuracy and validity of the test and
uses and that seems love

134
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,729
testing before the US Department of
Treasury officer threat is currently

135
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,330
working with the awesome considering
making awesome certified test mandatory

136
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,550
for banking throughout the United States
this level adoptions

137
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,620
drawn throughout the world many
different government and private

138
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,280
organizations in many different

139
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,030
so

140
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,030
let's take pics that when he and other
one Sacramento by security testing

141
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,340
what's the definition of a security
professional security professional has

142
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,620
to be one of the most difficult

143
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,709
professions in the information
technology field a securities

144
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:35,820
professional heston out a little bit
about a few things but a lot about

145
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,789
everything security professionals have
to be network architect software tester

146
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,679
programmers a

147
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,720
the engineer business manager Operations
Manager Marketing Specialist HR Manager

148
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,220
incident response in here

149
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,470
among other things if you are proficient
all these fields you need to look at

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,290
their minimum

151
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,000
communicate clearly and effectively the
organizations are experts in the field

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,339
without constant communication

153
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,560
with those experts your security doesn't
seem to fail

154
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,089
the oscar has contributed from all these
fields and others

155
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:13,089
and we understand the need to have

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,160
the the experts that are here

183
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,089
one of which I am NOT but privacy laws
play a strong role in methodology used

184
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,170
in security testing

185
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,490
depending on the laws in your local
jurisdiction nearly certain tests that

186

can it can be done any information that

these privacy laws are dependent upon
your country state region cetera

189
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,020
both pros and cons result from his
privacy laws

190
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,329
privacy laws generate awareness to the
non-security community as a whole

191
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,689
that's a good thing however it also
causes confusion as most these laws

192
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:22,319
urging her

193
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:27,569
poorly written into specifics they
generate the need for security tests

194
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:31,810
that's a good thing but there's not
clearly and we will define standards for

195
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,560
these tests

196
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,100
that's really awesome really comes into
play there are no

197
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,449
their due to the public as a whole that
there's no place to reporters user

auto versus test which does the security
tester do

200
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,589
right now based on privacy law and the
company that is contacting us we get to

201
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:49,120
choose

202
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,380
the real question is which one is right
and reliable if we choose the right one

203
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,829
privacy laws are source of revenue for
us this of course is very good

204
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:00,990
however if we don't comply properly

205
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,079
with these laws will also be a source of
funds and malpractice

206
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,339
privacy laws will in general very
positive and well-meaning

207
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,750
can also be very dangerous to security
testing industry let's talk a little bit

208
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,650
about compliance

209
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,050
at this point in time there is no

other laws protecting privacy

these

310
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,000
the steps remember the final assessment
is determined costing man-hours

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,250
during the entire project said after the
project comprising

312

there's a fine line between susman
anatase you need to do another

315
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,330
after work to get a proper adjustment it
did not do too much to be done when he

316
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,460
always

317
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,090
resources that could have been used
elsewhere symbolizing the NTC these

318
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,939
games have used to scan a potential
client IP ranges

319
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,640
this will show you how many extra facing
internet addresses may need to be tested

320
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,720
during the gauge min

321
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,520
along some services that are being
offered DNS can and should be used to

322
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,010
look for any information to write the
address information

323
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,950
write a review will help determine choke
points for Dawson the loss as well as

324
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,560
well ISP's and networking between you
and Tori

325
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,080
network network registration view web

327
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,560
system

328
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,220
the task using this

329
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,210
in in the techniques we just discussed
in very while to vary wildly

330
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,080
US security first no need to weigh the
time invested

331
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,629
against the reward when the contract and
accuracy all the time

332
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,600
resource Boolean given some other tests
are less the Onslow

333
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,200
for example we look at name server:
responses in the former examining domain

334
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
registry information

335
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,840
finding the IP block on in question
primary/secondary nice the name servers

336
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,980
for Hosni like the addresses if the name
servers are not properly secured might

337
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,669
be able to get a list of all IP
addresses

338
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:47,440
host names that are published external
determine the outnumbered layer and

339
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,690
routers be a TCP an ICMP ping sweep
since gains

340
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,240
this another more advanced techniques
can be used to determine a semi accurate

341
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,110
network map was no word mess created

342
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,150
we can focus our surging more towards
external sources

343
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,929
including tracks InformationWeek's
searching por las

344
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,400
intrusion logs newsgroup postings much
data can be going on the target

345
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,669
organization

346
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:12,850
million another interesting way of
determining information about targeted a

347
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,190
surge in job available postings from the
company

348
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,970
these IT I'd these IT based postings

349
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,010
per requirements that many times you a
significant amount of data as the

350
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,860
operating system type of machine
application layer

351
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,960
and possibly network design so the tools
used in assessments

352
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,410
here is a little sick Muse together the
assessment data without spending a

353
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,750
significant amount of time

354
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,390
many of these tools can be scripted an
automated to make your assessment

355
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,160
information

356
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:47,160
gathering session significantly less
than the test

357
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,430
so after you spend time pointing the
assessment information about the

358
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,330
potential client you might possibly be
overdrawn that somewhat similar to this

359
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,210
normally the maps that are generated
from a security perspective simply

360
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,000
include the physical network devices

361
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,340
any interfaces to the public from other
important note on a picture we have here

362
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,790
are the information-gathering results
there are many more interfaces into an

363
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,790
organization just through the firewall

364
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,560
there's information leaks from the
mobile office laptops the Internet

365
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,470
results the newsgroup postings

366
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,350
all this data will combine improperly
mind can be pieced together to

367
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,750
interpolate much more in

368
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,240
important pieces of data the end result
of which might possibly be the

369
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,240
compromises client information resources

370
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,440
obviously there's more than one way into
a network as security professional your

371
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,560
job is to show the customer as many of
these

372
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,250
possible don't let yourself in what he
displayed a client only limit yourself

373
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,880
only

374
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,380
legally do demonstrated now move on to
the trooper

375
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,380
got to the presentation the security
testing process Dawn Askham style

376
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,220
the awesome defines the problem the
processor security test is being

377
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,100
evaluated on his four areas

378
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,480
visibility access trust an alarm all of
your output will be evaluated on these

379
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,300
for tennis

380
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,770
visibility visibility is what we what
can be seen

381
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,550
lot or monitored in the security
presence both with and without the aid

382
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,840
of electronic devices

383
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,320
this includes but is not limited to
radio waves like the other visible

384
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,149
spectrum

385
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,550
communication devices such as telephones
GSM email

386
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:44,169
and network packets of course TCPIP
access is an entry point into the

387
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,230
security presence

388
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,020
an access point need not be a physical
barrier

389
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,590
this can include but is not limited to a
web page window

390
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,740
a network connection radio waves or
anything in which location supports the

391
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,430
definition

392
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:01,720
quasi-public where computer interacts
with another computer with a network

393
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,160
limiting access means denying all
acceptable as expressly permitted

394
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,100
financially and in bed and best
practices trust trust is a specialized

395
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,750
pathway

396
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,860
in regards to the security presence
trust includes the kind and amount of

397
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
authentication

398
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,970
non-repudiation access control
accountability

399
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,920
confidentiality and integrity between
two or more factors within the security

400
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,490
presence

401
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:31,610
and last alarm alarms the timely and
appropriate notification other

402
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,940
activities that violate or attempt to
violate

403
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,160
any of the other three tenets visibility
access and trust

404
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,560
in most security breaches alarm is often
simple process which in it

405
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:48,560
which initiates further consequences

406
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:54,639
again we based review on the visibility
access and trust

407
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:59,289
and alarm the data that we receive back
for example 0 visibility might be less

408
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,408
IP addresses shown to the external world

409
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:05,129
an example have access may be streaming
media that your customer

410
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:09,210
probably allows access to for the users
is a business justified do they actually

411
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,269
have a need for it

412
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:13,379
do you have a high level access just
because

413
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:17,639
do you have a high level that's just
because are kind of just $5 for business

414
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:18,249
reasons

415
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,809
trust does the customer happy probably
love trust with

416
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:26,240
other was only proper entities and of
course are the alarms reasonable

417
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,639
if there are too many false alarms the
real ones will be drowned out

418
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,570
yet on the other hand if there aren't
enough alarms you'll be missing

419
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,389
important data

420
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:38,100
so let's look at the security in their

421
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,519
securing it is a visual display the
security presence

422
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,039
within the awesome we break the security
presence in the sections

423
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,960
models contest the sections directly
correspond to the six sections in the

424
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,809
security men

425
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:55,509
these actions represent the security
presence of the company

426
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:59,129
Internet Security Information Security
physical security

427
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:02,779
communications security while security
security training

428
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:08,490
there's a close above those sections
demonstrating how they look as a whole

429
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,320
the sections are the are the whole
security presents a model divided into

430
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,009
manageable testable slots

431
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:22,009
the connectedness of the map is also
significant importance

432
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,820
everywhere in the sections overlap there
is no overlap and definition

433
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,689
for example where security training
intersects all the bottom three

434
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,919
communications wireless internet
Internet Security it is understood that

435
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:39,779
there has to be security training in
each of those disciplines to the

436
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:40,429
customer

437
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:45,320
for security test to be successful
another example is physical security and

438
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,869
information security they overlap
because if I can get into your server

439
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:51,600
room with a Buddhist on one road

440
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,100
sheens there is a distinct interaction a
croatian between all the sections a

441
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,019
former for securing that for security
testing to go by

442
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:06,019
so its glory to the sections a little
closer physical security the ass the

443
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:11,419
breaks down the physical security
section in the six different models

444
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,789
access control testing parameter review

445
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:18,330
monitor and review alarm response review

446
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,949
location review environment review each
in these models and broken down into

447
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,539
specific tasks the security tester came

448
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:29,919
easily repeatedly performed to allow a
thorough testing a physical security

449
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,389
some example tasks might be to examine
the alarm types

450
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:37,090
test access control devices for
vulnerabilities and weaknesses

451
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:41,360
mad about the location of monitoring
devices discovery of the persons

452
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,879
involved alarm review

453
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:49,879
and testing will set alarm for seniors

454
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,179
before we move on to the next two
sections are the ask them I want to

455
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,220
point out of there was like presentation

456
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,789
a new security test for quite some time
now many years in fact

457
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,960
first time I saw the slide it really
brought together a lot of the

458
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,490
information that had been in my head
that didn't have a way

459
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,190
a great way to being visualized it also
had a lot of pieces that ensure

460
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,399
necessarily thought-out in reference to
security testing

461
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:21,289
the majority security tester straight
down a path always stay on the right

462
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:21,870
hand side

what is considered information security
this section is now is desired by the

these techniques

478
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:21,840
the information found can help piece

comes to what end result the customer
really does want to see

I personally don't care for the name in
this model to me it's more

518
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,019
should be called social engineering
which is really what it is how do you

00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:12,139
external request model brakes in the

the Gateway person themselves

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,990
as such the oscar has increased as much
don't ask our

possibly the country decline cell

545
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,400
you have to consider many important
factors prior to completing a task

546
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,450
just like you get out of jail free card

547
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,610
twice together this information early on
in the process

548
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,720
the company's name and legal address as
well as all contact information

549
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,539
this includes the lead tech resources as
well as the officers of the company that

550
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,690
are sponsoring the project you need to
have both

551
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,179
written legal contract with the target
organization

552
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:44,510
you get out of jail free card and
sometimes depending on the countries

553
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,330
that are involved

554
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,960
written legal contract for the hosting
it the right ski that's definitely

555
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
something you need to consider if you're
working

556
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,918
intern around europe it all does a
customer require all the %ah some

557
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,240
sections or just a subset of those
sections

558
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,809
need to define which is the security
testing styles you'll be performing in

559
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:02,668
to what degree

560
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:07,590
you also need to define what your goals
are going to be

561
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,500
these are the primary goals in Austin
test

562
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,600
by using the sections models in tasks in
the awesome

563
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,799
you'll be able to assess the security of
the organization as a whole

564
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,090
we're giving them proven best practices
completing the steps of the last contest

565
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,169
you'll be able to recognize and
quantified

566
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:30,020
the business risk that an organization
has as well as privacy issues both

567
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,010
internal and external to the
organization

568
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,230
from the gathering of all this data it
will be very straight forward to suggest

569
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,730
and how to implement practical

570
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,890
security solutions to customer who
having the ass the methodology behind

571
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,520
you during the test also allow you to
fall back on the best practices in the

572
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,179
industry

573
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:53,179
and the customer will know what you can
give them

574
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,770
but let's talk about women to the
security test you have to be sure many

575
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,300
things we're doing security test the
most part of which is do not cause any

576
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,160
unauthorized downtime in losses revenue
to the customer that's very key

577
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,989
doing so is very detrimental to your
credentials as a security professional

578
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,990
try not to leave the customer into a
false sense of security and avoid the

579
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,679
politics within the organization if at
all possible

580
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,730
be careful not to waste

581
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,800
any resources and organization in the
form of unintentional alarm status

582
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,790
if there's a goal of the test previously
stated during the goal outline stages

583
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,120
triggering alarm states in reviewing
responses is acceptable

584
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,239
in other words be careful and always
know your limits to overstep the bounds

585
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,919
custom reporting requirements

586
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,609
to achieve lasting certification on a
test the security practitioner must meet

587
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,870
reporting requirements this is kinda key

588
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,359
it's it's the deliverables to the
customer and it has to meet certain

589
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,919
deliverable standards for

590
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,960
areas within the within the testing be
careful

591
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,790
these environmentalists and displayed in
the awesome itself

592
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,850
furry for client review prior to the
engagement so they know what to expect

593
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,040
from the security tester

594
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,259
the sections in the report are listed on
the slide

595
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,220
most the look fairly obvious as their
need of course the security testing

596
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,880
still

597
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,810
be an awesome task enough to report
doesn't have all the sections

598
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,529
assuming that is restricted because
those sections are Catholic a bowler

599
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:33,530
within stop other customers requirements
as we've shown the oscar has divided the

600
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,050
model sections in tests

601
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,200
the sections directly correspond to the
main divisions

602
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,990
security map and also in direct relation
to the internet presence points

603
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,780
when doing in Austin test the security
tester flows from one model to the next

604
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,370
model by using the tasks listed in each
model

605
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,240
the input to a model when processed
using the tasks listed

606
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,930
will generate expected output that our
present a Canon fed into the next march

607
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,120
on augmented with additional input
information

608
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,980
this model generous the next set of
buttons on and so on

609
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,350
the output is simply a result of the
completed tasks

610
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:16,350
a model based on the input into it

611
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,500
here's a summary slide in the sections
that we went through

612
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,539
a long way to the models and make up
those sections if you really want to get

613
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:27,880
into further detail with a break the
slide down into additional levels in

614
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,809
right out the tasks that are defined
within each of the models

615
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:35,369
the flow then be blatantly obvious it's
either in protest

616
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:38,660
was required for the upper castes and
the output as it flows from model to

617
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,140
model

618
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:46,140
drop methodology so what happens if we
do a module has no output doesn't

619
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,170
necessarily mean that you get the model

620
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,670
wrong they could certainly indicate a
tester inability

621
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,079
but more than likely indicates very
tight security from the organization

622
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,119
it doesn't have to mean that either it
could mean that the model was not after

623
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,670
the ball to what the organization
requires or that the output of the test

624
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,670
has been properly analyzed by the tester

625
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,220
if for some reason it s really give you
know output or incomprehensible output

626
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,970
is the job of the tester and quite
possibly protesters to look for each

627
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,140
other's shoulders and double check the
validity of a

628
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,319
model results if they come back they
love they come back they out there was

629
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:22,980
no upward

630
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,339
saws lectures looking model here

631
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,710
I'll this is kinda form and the template
within

632
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,859
within the ask them for module on

633
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:37,348
but easy internet security sector the
asteroid as an example to get noticed

634
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:38,059
that pretty well

635
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:41,319
at the top you can see the name of the
model for our

636
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:45,440
for our example within section 1 that
might say system identification

637
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,970
underneath that is the description of
the model for system identification

638
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,420
would say

639
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,609
something to the effect that system
fingerprinting is the active probe into

640
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,130
the system for response was

641
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,819
they can distinguish unique systems to
the operating system inversion layer

642
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:03,470
with endless the expected results for
this particular model

643
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,210
Willis the expected results because if
you don't know what you're looking for a

644
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,020
security test you're going to end up
spinning your wheels looking for

645
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,230
something you never gonna find

646
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,619
our example unexpected results for that

647
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,450
further I'm for the what we're talking
about is OS Type

648
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:23,339
patch level system type system
enumeration and internal system that

649
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:23,940
worked for us

650
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:30,849
finally at the bottom is listed the
tasks to perform to complete the module

651
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,940
the inputs to the model would have come
from previous models while the outputs

652
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,500
gathered from this model feeding

653
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,289
future models in your test says we're
doing system identification some other

654
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:44,220
tasks listed in the Oscar for this model
including

655
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,380
exam system responses to determine
operating system type in caps while

656
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,039
examine application responses to
determine operating system type in patch

657
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:52,539
low

658
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:56,309
search job postings for server
application information from the target

659
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:02,470
Center processor security test

660
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,779
definition other process types of an
awesome task just like any good security

661
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,779
test even break up the models and gas
into categories

662
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,380
passive passive an intrusive attacks

663
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,059
passive attacks will not a factor
trespass on the party system that all

664
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:21,069
no degradation a remote services in the
least intrusive it s

665
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:24,299
will trespass on target systems or
networks and quite possibly can degrade

666
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:25,130
or you

667
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,460
can degrade or utilize services I

668
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,420
dedicated sniffer box being a test never
gonna probably checkpoint pass attack

669
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,000
same flight on the web server to
discover the believe the router and

670
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,859
server they have a high traffic loads or

671
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:44,049
settled awesome their network in Jersey
today evaluation about

672
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:48,279
on this is a very important pieces
security puzzle you need to understand

673
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,400
how to get away all the up a base

674
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,299
based upon the tests that are completed
so stick with the growing process around

675
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:01,450
long time for some slightly less on

676
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,670
again collected for tennis visibility
access trust an alarm

677
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,710
when the office returns from its the
models a good security tester a

678
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,640
valuation

679
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,529
its visibility on I know none of us in
this room is there a company

680
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:15,730
organization tell us

681
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,099
oh that machine yeah we don't publish
that machine's IP address

682
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:23,440
so nobody knows it's there well it's
visible in class

683
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,270
high visibility to anyone who is
actively searching the company's IP

684
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,099
address space

685
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:30,260
so knowing the course title systems the

686
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,970
all of your office should be looked
efforts visibility bomb

687
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:38,059
to an external source access

688
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:42,759
access as the date is returned from the
models we need to evaluate against its

689
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:43,630
accessibility

690
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,119
I really need access the web 13 do you
really need web access to mp3 files for

691
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,349
your internal users

692
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:52,579
do you really need stream media from CNN
dot com

693
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,779
all data must be evaluated against
access

694
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:59,390
is a business justified is basically the
question you need to ask yourself in the

695
00:40:59,390 --> 00:40:59,759
past

696
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:03,039
trust

697
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,720
how much people trust your systems to be
a with her I was gonna trust integrity

698
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,380
of the data that you are sending them

699
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,210
so piece the puzzle hood of education
before data submitted

700
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:17,539
non-repudiation the data access control
so the data and data confidentiality

701
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:21,380
to the business partners have a higher
level of trust in the shirt or the

702
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,789
limited what they really need to know

703
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:27,109
and lasses

704
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,980
alarm

705
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,940
from my experience is quite often this
is the weakest link in an organization's

706
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,490
security measures

707
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:40,900
I'm too many false alarms the true
alarms are going to ground out too many

708
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,109
alarms

709
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:45,480
and you're bound to be missing some the
right one some other ones there's a fine

710
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,849
line to the large quantity

711
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:49,910
that meets but does not exceed
expectations

712
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,038
make sure the company is not crying wolf
also know what alarm systems are being

713
00:41:54,039 --> 00:42:00,740
used in if they're adequate the case the
offer that is common for the models

714
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:06,390
conclusions in conclusion the Austin is
the industry's attempt to legitimize the

715
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,670
security testing profession

716
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,900
make the professional live up to the
standards are the best in the broader

717
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,900
security testers they contribute to the
manual on a regular basis

718
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,130
if you read the manual and determine
their something that were missing

719
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,940
submit if you read the main on the term
there something you know they shouldn't

720
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,020
be there

721
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,490
submitted and last but not least if you
like what you see

722
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,180
join the peer review process and check
other people submissions

723

please take the time to visit www.ypd
idea idea hamster died or

724
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,190
join the mailing lists and the peer
review process

725
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:47,190
thank you for your time %ah

726
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,940
I don't see a lot of emphasis on
identifying

727
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,549
organization's assets for asylum test

728
00:42:56,549 --> 00:43:01,259
that one of the modules farm incorporate
across the board in a few models

729
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:06,000
him go down the task level on it may be
something we should expand on

730
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,390
I I seriously consider that is something
that's growing attention moslems are

731
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,740
and I also see an emphasis on the
outside this outsider

732
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,690
that's right Martin's desperate this the
it is put on a targeted

733
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,470
a outside threat is not necessarily
something in use an internal

734
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,640
security audit although he applied also
I'm not sure I see a lot of

735
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,078
was a review policies and procedures

736
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:33,240
it's there at the test load gets down to
that I don't break down so far

737
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,440
you know like I said this presentation
its 340

738
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,599
go hollowing out into itself

739
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,430
him talking longs G of the most

740
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:48,960
home and just went in with family more
fly in slow here dome

741
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,029
in the testers are located or something

742
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:56,299
it's both is absolutely both

743
00:43:56,299 --> 00:44:00,670
the lost bar is is something that
actually I don't know enough about I

744
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,509
think a lot of testers a lot of people

745
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:06,170
tripping don't necessarily know nothing
about have a few lawyers they contribute

746
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,420
so is lost love try to incorporate as
best we can

747
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,099
on but we can use any additional
resources that people can

748
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,119
condoning that area

749
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,250
note that the last

750
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,339
a lot of changes does it

751
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:25,950
include any guidelines are modules

752
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,130
dealing with their re: rations with you

753
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:29,990
the cost

754
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,270
testing legs attention business partners
or

755
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:38,329
songs yes in not specifically in essence
it would say this is a model pertaining

756
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:38,890
to that

757
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,009
but again there something this folding
and a theme across because

758
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,119
the he happily all Europe based on trust
and

759
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,230
right so a lot of that if you have
something like that

760
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:52,890
you creations business for

761
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,779
as answers to your questions

762
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:57,930
is it do you I'll foreign go as far as

763
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,739
access spores getting into partners
areas

764
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:06,289
not per se person stepped on something
needs mint

765
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:10,460
a

766
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,529
you have a law firm that you don't have
response

767
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:19,650
the long as a holes category you have a
list what services are all

768
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,170
you know that the contingencies the
analysis at the control

769
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:28,529
those services so let's say is that is a
Korean you want the screaming

770
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:32,719
study committee the quote you want to be
able to analyze

771
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,609
who controls turning it on all of their
ability to turn it on or

772
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:41,029
then what are your responses when the
along those lines alarms something you

773
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:44,279
you going which outfit based upon it's
not that it's a module

774
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:47,809
say so if you look at physical let's
look at physical

775
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:52,469
security server some other tasks are to
you trigger the alarm to look at the

776
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:53,210
responses

777
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:56,460
so I think what you're talking about is
is test level stuff

778
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,690
then you're building which is based upon
the alarms said they sense

779
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,420
yes but I'm saying both

780
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,529
analysis is a response structure let's
say there's a fire

781
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:11,779
I would have long yeah as you analyze
stuff

782
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:15,579
you don't have I don't believe that with
the building were things need to be say

783
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:19,200
who is it that does it there your see
the whole structure

784
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,819
involved in at a response the long after
those of

785
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:26,538
is the analog catch me after what I have
a heart that would go through but mostly

786
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:29,460
tasks in there that address that I don't
know that s global

787
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,900
and I've been rising in some other these
documents show but already there's test

788
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,069
levels to go over there

789
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:38,019
state sovereignty

790
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:41,229
eyes his its original

791
00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:44,890
mission other use simply certainly
recisions

792
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,160
lobbyists toward

793
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,499
see are cause people fibers

794
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:54,779
luck clinton's and unfortunately

795
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:59,019
I think for are security his

796
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:02,309
calls this least said wells doing

797
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:05,779
world a host policy or when workers

798
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:10,190
little me what what we and haven't
convinced

799
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:15,680
Bulls me since I

800
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,058
Sonata too much in essence to for
specifics on that

801
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:23,619
from again I'm not a lawyer so I I lost
over

802
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:26,749
loss and I don't know nearly to the
degree that a yes

803
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:32,759
you know problem no but in essence we
try to incorporate that the pieces of

804
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:34,029
the laws that say

805
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:37,859
whole day this month time if they're in
effect

806
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:42,719
as a law we have to do you know I'm
whether the writer on majority the time

807
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:45,839
copyright and I agree completely we have
included in the

808
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,979
in the methodology something we have to
do until you get 'em

809
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:52,640
take now you know once there want to
remove the group from

810
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,589
national I donning snow setting

811
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:02,840
three minutes

812
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:09,300
