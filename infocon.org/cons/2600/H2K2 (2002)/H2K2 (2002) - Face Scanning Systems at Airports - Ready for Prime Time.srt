00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,650
up

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,370
hi to my name is that Richard Smith I
read it heater site called

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,260
your bites man modest see her second
talk from

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,350
data talk yesterday a tracking criminals
on the Internet %uh

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,100
today's can be a little bit different
it's more gas track of Matthew wells and

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,360
it's beginning to

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,340
as a surprise publications gadgets as
wells

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,610
policies okay this is a

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,300
area I miss Holly for possible

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,460
more than a year half I'll which he got
into

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,030
are looking at stake face threatened
software

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,329
when reading the news stories about
forgot call this new purple

14
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,219
here %uh the Super Bowl was not this
year's

15
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,389
previous years Florida on had a this
recognition said

16
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,699
so that each person with turnstiles and
by

17
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,780
a certain missions it was a database

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,349
for about 3,000 people that area
explained

19
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,649
various kinds criminal warrants and said
they were

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,049
is the superbowl ads today

21
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,289
place around us criminals up shelters
convenient place to do this

22
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:18,509
it well they claim they match

23
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,600
got 19 matches but no arrests old the
company said it work

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,360
but the met was people's

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,910
calculations other I just I was arrested
%uh

26
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,539
anyway the the system was put in though
with the idea of

27
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,690
you know us us keeping us safe from the
terrorist was

28
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,480
forces camera even on the

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,250
the company decided the issue a press
release that this had happened

30
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,610
and sir created a the controversy more
than that probably expected

31
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,630
on it actually got a big brother war

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,479
from Privacy International Church
actually gave a nomination up

33
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,700
after that a after that system

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,830
others the next big controversy with a
scanning was

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,419
up again in Tampa in Tampa area where
the local police again won it around a

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,830
little

37
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,000
the usual suspects and today

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,959
face Kane system and you foresee which
is really entertaining area other

39
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,970
Tampa so the nightclub and restaurant
erasers

40
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,230
share and the same idea was to

41
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,200
to quell the the law the regular
closed-circuit TV systems

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,170
Witcher throughout their neighborhood a
equipped with face recognition so that

43
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,910
they can find the local criminals

44
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,090
and against us a convenience to bleach
it just makes it easier to spot people

45
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,120
and they have a in that particular
system a licensed

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,140
put up author 30,000 people the database

47
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,220
although only have a few thousand so far
I actually spoke to the

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,230
a the plea to the head the guy

49
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,018
Tampa Police farms editors project in
given the right at home

50
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,150
who's in their hands kinda interesting
it was you know people who wanna

51
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,560
askin ASEAN outstanding criminal
warrants

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,250
no sex offenders and on

53
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,500
just general bad people have been
arrested before for

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,530
you know pickpocket whenever they they
thought might hang out there

55
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,459
%uh money-losing things is they could
arrest the

56
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,739
people were wanting now sending rest
towards someone as a sexual offender

57
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,150
registry wasn't supposed to be in the
neighborhood

58
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,880
they weren't allowed to rest all the
haters much in same bed with the long

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,070
because it has jurisdiction over these
peoples assertive

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,410
the system's hazard also is up
interesting policy

61
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,620
decisions with them are however

62
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,060
face creating a face recognition %uh
software became

63
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,060
a really hot item after September 11 and
it's an interesting study in commerce

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,569
why that on this basically here the
nazis two companies for

65
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,830
with the big players in the face
recognition software business

66
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,879
one is the saws in Europe in the Boston
area around

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,750
brothers and the other company years
this highlights which

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,530
households again it's are and their they
have offices in

69
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,780
actually overtures insidious loss couple
other places around the country

70
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,339
and basically what happened is that

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,690
both look up the song of business
opportunity after

72
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,010
after nine 911 to of security services
for airports

73
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,950
and so they came up with this idea love
using face recognition systems affecting

74
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,150
every airport with them

75
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,960
to look for the the bad terrorist and

76
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,370
I but became skeptical skeptic on this a
lot of different loves a lot I hope to

77
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,200
do today

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,260
is certain parts that skepticism here

79
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,090
la know what I see is a problem with the
system's

80
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,789
and is very interesting you know they're
very for a high taking products in the

81
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,539
sense that they take video images

82
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,580
an attempt to match a features on
people's faces

83
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,659
work with databases lottery Anderson
technology

84
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:07,310
on but there's also a lot of very
interesting real-world problems alone

85
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,500
must deal with points on the system's

86
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,669
and consider you know how they can
really be use

87
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,789
and I'll its Anderson said he also how I
and that in times as River

88
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,000
troubles here terrorism companies are
for taking

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
mangers situation making pitches on
these problems

90
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,340
on

91
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,680
water for 20 a for some uses for the
pace kansas's airport one is

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,000
the one that's getting all across the
one that's making like you know peter

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,900
jennings easing news and so on is

94
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,950
is spotting suspected terror tears in
the terms

95
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,140
themselves so the basic idea is you have

96
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,349
you take your your CC haiti needs to
work other

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,530
a video camera she set up any other
databases

98
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,190
known terrorist thing looking for them
at the airport and

99
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,960
the idea she has bottomed here
warranties he see Selena database

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,570
officially confirmed by a person in this
by Donna was really one of those

101
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,349
terrorists

102
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,320
he got tackled in the term sleaze here
on

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,630
nothing can be done here's the thing:
talk about is in some background checks

104
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,240
and money

105
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,500
before going on the airplane other juror
they

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,650
they a again the same thing spot in
tears for the ones russia trying to get

107
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,820
on the airplanes

108
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,020
%uh work additional applications for
face getting the access controls

109
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,210
to restricted areas you today at the
airport you know we're all familiar with

110
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,650
the swipe cards at the the place isn't
here

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,940
for were sometimes he had to leave you
may be in for advance the fingerprint

112
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,540
system

113
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,250
which lost his face came to that so
that's a reversing database has the good

114
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,730
guys

115
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,830
here you looking for them and

116
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,940
another another one is background checks
for new hires

117
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,950
at airports now you know

118
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,870
no hi Jeff Turnbull work the air force's
la concerned about

119
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,920
employees at airports they have access
to live

120
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,900
luck with them in the airlines and
needed do background checks on says

121
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,670
minimum

122
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,110
other governments forcing all airports
to

123
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,020
rock singer chest people but interface K

124
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,580
yes and Davis bad people atop

125
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,340
10 questions is what has has a face
gaming system work

126
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,140
it's it's actually pretty
straightforward which is better in too

127
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,860
much trouble

128
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,180
understanding the basic idea up but

129
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,390
you really have to to basic him to basic
components as you have a video camera

130
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,010
you have a computer with the video video

131
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,380
Bergeron converse digitizes Korea
digital camera begin

132
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,600
so basically have a a

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,420
the video camera setup some location
they can get good shots

134
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,600
people's faces you know pointing in the
right the right level for

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,650
a shot and that goes into is fed into
the computer

136
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,880
converted little street us official

137
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,450
into it digital format and then on

138
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,770
what the face scanning software does is
it looks for the odds

139
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,610
interest first spot this face uses
algorithms for looking with the bases

140
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,220
then within that us where it looks for
the two oz

141
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,430
he says her me one then on

142
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,770
it recognize other features on the face
who knows

143
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,180
where your mouth is cheats and so on and
that takes various measures

144
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,070
a and from this it creates additional 10

145
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,700
which is a certain card along number
which represents who you are

146
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,840
%ah euthanasia take pictures and get a
little bit different numbers were there

147
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,250
but

148
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,490
four people up you tended end up with
the same traditional

149
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,760
him but all the time then the second
component

150
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,819
issue have a database a pitchers and

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,120
photos that she's somehow taken as a
mother

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,210
preview point time in the house out with

153
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,660
takes a template the G just measured
picture taken any matching

154
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,529
each person day

155
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,199
come up with a list teachers it seem to
be close to that to that person and if

156
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:18,719
you have a

157
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
looking for the bad guys it sounds the
alarm in says we meet a bad guy

158
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,699
here if you get a good guide system you
know where you're letting access into

159
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,829
Sayeed enclosed area it unlocks the door

160
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,129
yes it can kill you direction the whole
ideas lar

161
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:39,319
he get closer match yes

162
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:42,360
yeah well I will I will talk about that
as a whistle

163
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,050
propitious here that these guys thought
about those like up

164
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,910
is one of the problems doings I

165
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,219
so but that we have this concept though
the alarm in the alarm for me to be a

166
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,100
little warmer than

167
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:03,100
depending trying to build on

168
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:08,160
now into the matching system and I'm
actually played around with the busy on

169
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,459
its face it software

170
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,389
and you know each of a package works a
little differently but this is the year

171
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:14,290
the same idea

172
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,980
across the different vendors up if we
have two photos with him when he met

173
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,980
measure we have achieved helpless more
taken all these measurements

174
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,380
and

175
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,520
gotta writing templates her body this
particular maybe

176
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,230
80 bytes up but what we do is we have

177
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,339
algorithm that matches two templates
together then rates

178
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:41,320
the match on a scale from 0 to 10 40
means no match whatsoever

179
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,779
in 10 identical match and

180
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,810
I we then have a a

181
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,839
threshold value where we say if the
matching value

182
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
is greater than or equal to the
threshold then we probably

183
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,279
this picture these two pitchers
represent the same person and in the

184
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,070
case if that is the onyx ever

185
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,260
default values 8.5 I

186
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,089
however you can adjust that you can just
add value one way or the other

187
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,660
you have a quick question your session
start of this but I don't remember this

188
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,670
I'll a good deal on water fans here crap

189
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,670
show news TV program up front end her
show

190
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,819
few weeks back here whistles take a
where these face recognition system

191
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,480
you see the show where they had this the
hack this is the hacker guy

192
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,140
his stocking the the woman with with
video cameras and

193
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:38,140
yeah but it was a it yes it is really
appropriate for the site is a hacker guy

194
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,330
was thought in Islam and

195
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,640
in her apartment video cameras and

196
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,939
up they the cops discovered the cameras
that dinner who put him in there anyway

197
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,600
trace all that get a website

198
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,510
is observing journalists to on but s
ironic

199
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,650
moment is the way that they caught him I
was using a face recognition system

200
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:03,279
and so certain you know they're Hughes
video taken by me haha the video video

201
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,830
system

202
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,110
and in the in the in the show they did a
pretty good job on the face recognition

203
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,130
part because he said

204
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,189
oh yeah we crave the thing down really
loves hola

205
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,120
so the end up having to false positives
for state they gradually guys who was in

206
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,779
the guide

207
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,570
third internet Matthew person other
shows you know

208
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,990
and they said right on the show he said
that personal down really love just to

209
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,660
make sure we

210
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,069
catch I

211
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,760
so you know there's little bit of our if
you will

212
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,880
choosing a right threshold values he
said too high

213
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,730
you'll miss the bad guys or if you're
building a good guy system you all a

214
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,530
good guy

215
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,000
you know in through the door naturally
bad you know if you got me trying to a

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,680
job make it through the door to

217
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,440
get to the place that's bad I also but
you know if he had a bad guy sitting

218
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
that citizens and their catch people I
he said it to love you get a reverse

219
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,500
problem

220
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,850
which is a system cries wolf and and it
will

221
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,140
say to people with the same person that
really not that's that what happened

222
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,430
there

223
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,720
on a lot more they had two people today

224
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,090
name is identified yeah

225
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:24,090
on

226
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,119
I'm sorry has largely here use the
microphone

227
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:38,119
clue please when you have a question go
to the Mikes

228
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,430
news well I guess some system flightless
some systems have that but

229
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,199
yeah

230
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,930
I rushed my mother systems I know the
only

231
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,380
don't have the cash yeah hazardous
there's watching a video signal a time

232
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,819
trying to grab grab the pictures

233
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:09,440
yeah I but that's another

234
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,160
will get into summer this summer the the
problems here making this all work

235
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,430
so a if he said the threshold to lull

236
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,850
will will finger innocent people or a
lot the is

237
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,240
the wrong guys to the door for the gas
system and everything everything is just

238
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,769
right

239
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:30,610
and then we a up we got a system or
subprime world

240
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,800
Roseland right people and the trial is
this really have a possible come up with

241
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,949
just right value so we end up trying

242
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:41,190
sir balance out between two line

243
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,449
to load hitting on application on

244
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:52,240
now playing around with the other face
and software

245
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,149
I'll I found that the matching
algorithms are very sensitive

246
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,829
and you you have to have a really good
images

247
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:04,920
for the system to work I so

248
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,019
some other things that would affect a
the ability to match what one is

249
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:10,699
lighting

250
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,329
the had to have good lighting went when
you're taking a picture

251
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,389
I also the background one like a clean
background and the other a

252
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,920
objects in the background the mess
things up which is so strange physically

253
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,839
10 spots in the face the sorts of
problems a

254
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,939
face opposition expression matter

255
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:31,969
you know so that as I smiler or

256
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,029
turn my head that would affect the
operatives I

257
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:38,170
even is wearing wear glasses or
sunglasses sunglasses a particular

258
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,290
really bad basically

259
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,290
with the busy on a system you cannot
wear sunglasses

260
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,240
sleepy it's all presentation on this is
Naveen Saini

261
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,550
have to take certain classes of now
airport even tell people

262
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,800
you know you're gonna have to do that
whenevers the cameras around

263
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,089
as you're doing something else lives a
life anymore City

264
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:01,430
maybe have a luxury I yasser camera
position yes we already mentioned that

265
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,839
weathers suffered and whatever so
there's a lot of there's a lot of

266
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,199
factors ago in here

267
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,300
when you set up a face recognition
system you basically have to control the

268
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,730
environment where the cameras

269
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,949
on and this is a this is very poor

270
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:20,230
this is very important for this to work
is can't for camera many places hope it

271
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,809
works

272
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:24,209
on I wanna go over here now

273
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:29,660
system actually I'll some other tests
that Iran here just give you some ideas

274
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,100
here

275
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,819
a this is a

276
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:39,620
these are various pictures that I took
my head like a little database in bed

277
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,000
guess this is a bad guy database which
went with this is but

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,730
I'll have databases three pitchers
myself and I would try out

279
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,920
various poses and think in various
situations

280
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,079
the sea have that effect matching so you
can see the top there

281
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,910
I'll the top two pitchers you know came
in pretty good 7.8

282
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,559
in in a actually lowered the lighting in
a book little bit better

283
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:07,559
arm with a database you know pictures I
had on

284
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,990
he put a hand on you can see that drop

285
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,929
dropping damn thing and the seven 7 they
were classes in

286
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:21,220
7.6 and no compare to some point it so
there's a little bit of fact here

287
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,110
but if we said Aiea thrust hola 752

288
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:32,110
woodstock casualties are suppose it
doesn't matter that my wife would kill

289
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,179
me if I shared

290
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,740
I can run that test you know my life to
swim i'd

291
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,370
I but you can see here I look up

292
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,860
my eyes are looking up that ross et if I
smile that you're upset

293
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,030
up

294
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,889
close the eyes remember eyes are you
seeing her point so that had a pretty

295
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,370
real or effectively look down but you
know you can see really want sunglasses

296
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,040
just kill the system all said we go from
72 59 here on this

297
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,649
so you this is why does the onyx and you
must take certain classes of

298
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:12,240
for their system were the more
interesting cases really

299
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,700
are down here as easy as you look away
as a

300
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,010
United measure that 20 degree turn but
you can see I see still see my eyes and

301
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,610
let me turn that far away from

302
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,649
when the camera and an assist holy mess
a system a

303
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:31,429
so in in a at in a situation where
you're looking for the tears she may

304
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:34,570
have an opportunity to look at two or
three or four frames so

305
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,790
but as they get their head turned away
from from from from

306
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,040
from from the camera at just the right
time in the system's not gonna

307
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:49,040
not recognize

308
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,580
are I don't know I among expert at that

309
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,750
at their software so that would be a
good question and i cant

310
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,210
came I can answer that question but it
would seem to me was

311
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,909
I'll with what's interesting here is in
the day-to-day

312
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,830
the database that I have had all the
pictures of myself

313
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,668
you know they were posed pictures that I
was you like you do for driver's license

314
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:14,990
or something like that saw a lot of the
same factors kickin

315
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,679
on the database photos we know what if
your head is turned 18 for the photo the

316
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,350
database

317
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,889
so but I have found is that it did match
up better

318
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:26,019
if I had two pitchers where they're both

319
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:30,490
turned away that gave a fairly decent
match that's you know so the chances

320
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,279
looking this way

321
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,279
this way the other time you know there
be no match possible install

322
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,570
yeah okay

323
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,740
that's a good question I have a I i'm
gonna be like the sun glasses

324
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,990
but I didn't think that one yeah Sep at

325
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,019
I think people have a look at you yet at
the airport but sunglasses 11 pretty

326
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,580
pretty normal normal thing

327
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,580
and so they say you got you got taken
off yeah

328
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,380
if that's a big question in SL it has
passed another test I made it

329
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,060
clearly if you wanna put on the system's
and as the concert SAT

330
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,240
Iran I just think the follows you know
had you know

331
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,740
like hatchery are thicker glasses
anything like that those are kinda

332
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,840
testing wanna run here for for real
insulation could you guys use a

333
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,050
microphone please

334
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,330
when you get recorded okay I'll try it

335
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:46,330
say the questions

336
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:50,549
your question is if you use make up any
player a bit like a fake

337
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,139
fake nose on or something like that
digital system up front that might that

338
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:55,679
may

339
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,509
it depends on if it's something being
measured but I know the facial hair

340
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,639
doesn't look too much at the mouth

341
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:04,859
so you know see-saw affair with a smile
that change things on sale of

342
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:08,589
past for something bad to happen cap

343
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:12,369
have on the shaker heights your
interests

344
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:16,820
hahaha message yes it's so what does
that say to address me on the terrace at

345
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,579
as a only be there face recognition for
that but yes

346
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:25,300
yeah

347
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,220
well first to the study I should huh
trial second-hand boats

348
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,470
as is Tess yeah yeah

349
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,890
me we have in Holland have a nice your
system in place

350
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,910
really most states last speaker

351
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,210
nice bright yellow letters sp

352
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,390
letters thought meanwhile nice our

353
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,750
so i think im I doing how's the checks
for the check

354
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,520
sheet over a trajectory tech change your
last getting outta iris

355
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,170
given range highway I'm I thought ash

356
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,300
devices come home back car

357
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,090
which consists all these lights comments

358
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,409
splattered yeah in one giant explosion

359
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,380
just saw this is work by scoring
different elements

360
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,240
what's the chance your eyes as opposed
to that

361
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,680
his last sounds like me

362
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,340
be home she's streamline yeah well we
don't have the terrace too much less I'm

363
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,399
getting any ideas

364
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,230
yeah other hole will get it I think
there's plenty of other problems in our

365
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,660
yeah on Amy elite forgive me

366
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,210
yes this is but stresses

367
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,480
Amy this is used 1 photo per person of

368
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,920
you can have multiple phones has the
same you wouldn't be possible

369
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,650
say device taking average all he's

370
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,350
different pictures say head down eyes
closed

371
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,890
all columns there may be that
possibility the system doesn't

372
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,390
have only has one for doesn't have this
concept the mobile phones per person he

373
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,880
can put me in that there's no
correlation between them

374
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,400
between so I that's a good question for
the onyx but I just

375
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,170
a triples okay but you can't feel awful
photos

376
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,150
and so some some photos made track
better than other ones

377
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,870
yeah I mean if you have multiple phones
first different positions then it will

378
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,480
match

379
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,600
Yahoo that pero

380
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,870
it Natraj runs at so this

381
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,190
with him and he G

382
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,970
are getting that everybody's ass

383
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,399
first

384
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,879
assist French systems

385
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:48,309
you said missus what is

386
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,889
liability does this message

387
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,859
okay I are getting to that but if I
don't remind me

388
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:00,119
okay as well we'll that's harder so the
catch

389
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,229
catching okay so up

390
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:06,690
in on this part here annual meeting you
can see

391
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,759
that this is not for that perfect
technology by any stretch of the

392
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,710
imagination

393
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,940
yeah I and

394
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,970
by the way to actually show that the
stock honey

395
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,109
for Boston Logan Airport use consider
buddy

396
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:23,759
system yeah at up I

397
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,009
early on was given 10 minutes and but
anyway the

398
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,349
one lady said thank you very much they
weigh a ton of the stage was

399
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:34,379
it she says you know I was you know I
really she says

400
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:38,159
I H and five my pitches were less than
flattering light say

401
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,409
and a and bull there was a bitch up at
the time it was it was

402
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:48,429
a slight nothing here I'm at this using
my smile pictures here

403
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:52,429
but as you can see this year turning
into a different at different places you

404
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:53,570
get different Nationals

405
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,700
and then these are the database bitches
here some of them

406
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:05,700
you know that one having room is switch

407
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,419
yeah i i didnt you know home have the

408
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,860
but those are all those are all good
things missing see other hola matchup

409
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,610
you think here's our big party alarm

410
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,730
I don't know I don't police I don't
believe their part the other okay

411
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:31,730
okay

412
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:38,649
okay there was a question about age and

413
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:41,960
so what I did was I took to various
pitchers

414
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,309
that I it's Natasha happened you know in
in the shoebox in my house

415
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:50,269
scan demand and then just directed that
check HERE

416
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:53,700
now arm what it what it look like

417
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:00,109
you know so I have these pictures here
you know 8389 8390 698 2008 across

418
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:04,639
that all a cross between a here and my
feeling was

419
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:09,330
on another great statistician and eyes
here a little bit bad it seem like

420
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,289
this they're still good matches between
different years but the closer the

421
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:16,979
pictures were in time the better the
matches were

422
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:21,080
the certain look at that %ah perot you
get the best match in a

423
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,379
wanna just 75 it goes back up but I

424
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:27,629
you know there's some exceptions here
but up you know the

425
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,009
there there is a major factor it's not
that bad you know the song was a 20-year

426
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,590
span on here we're getting pretty good
match fans

427
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:40,590
yeah

428
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,500
I not really know not there to set up
there's two matches a template so

429
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,010
up there may be is there are some people
that work

430
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,090
were any kind Obama check system works
worse than

431
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,620
than other people and so there may be
ethnic groups that can work

432
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,970
were spent pretty much does not really
any at

433
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,890
Seitzer biases built in yes as far as I
know yeah you can

434
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,650
you know I for one think there's no way
saying lifestyle yards for are spot on

435
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,760
style for it you can do that yeah well
maybe

436
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,800
to some degree I think be yeah you think
that that you could probably do without

437
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,060
with this software you have to have
difference offer

438
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:31,060
K

439
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:37,529
it's just basically this area a I la
there's something claim up to 18 points

440
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:38,669
but its order that here

441
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:45,549
just give you an idea that pitches
hearing

442
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:48,799
all the same fears as I don't have any
non

443
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,980
here once his passport photo yeah

444
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,200
they they they they they do you say that

445
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,940
yes is after about age 16 are that they
have faced stabilizes

446
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,330
okay

447
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,080
I here's some the hijacker test page is
kinda fun

448
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,799
up I

449
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,870
grab these photos of the FBI website and
you can see

450
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,289
we've got a pretty good match 8.4
between these two photos and into

451
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:28,090
my Isaac the one on the left you know he
gave some way he was the leader there

452
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,100
on but 8.46 a good match so you can see
just that you know aging effect doesn't

453
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,809
matter

454
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:39,178
here there's another one as a very
different pictures I think a lot of

455
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:39,929
people would say

456
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:43,129
literally the same guy but they came out
pretty good there

457
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:48,100
and you know we had a lower had lower
quality pictures are even less want to

458
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,809
claim tax

459
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:51,408
I don't think anybody call an excellent
but tell you know that's that's true

460
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:51,879
love

461
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:55,470
K the next

462
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,120
the next thing here yes

463
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,590
all think there's two different s

464
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,720
minded to gather a so

465
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,309
match me up against the hijackers air
7.4 that's a pretty good match

466
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:17,850
yeah yes

467
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,379
you know what's kinda scary though is
that cute matching up to that same guy

468
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:25,590
yeah he feels

469
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,600
yeah I love he's dead good he was

470
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,139
so I I probably would set the alarms of
here but

471
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:39,299
you like and came came kinda close close
that someone or so close right yeah I

472
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,029
kinda thought

473
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:43,139
7.5 threshold be a good one miss camper

474
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:48,509
pretty pretty darn close their on these
here but these are the ones they were

475
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,799
not that to get a message like that come
up

476
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,240
this guy I'm take a lot of Holland much
a while

477
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,690
of these values are not scale courts

478
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,940
days large Chris

479
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,200
lists all tests little right yes

480
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,220
right so the probability of this

481
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,169
mishmash is gonna rocky knows the size
avis gets better

482
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:18,169
probability members okay

483
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,299
okay I

484
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,600
so that what I gave you you know what my
actual results where they're here and

485
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,690
these are some other

486
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,740
here some %uh the so things I noticed

487
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,929
I'll you know lighting makes a big
difference a

488
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,169
makes a big difference in image quality
I'll

489
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:42,539
a good neutral background is good

490
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:46,549
sunglasses system which busy onyx now
says publicly

491
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:50,720
that in Houston's an interesting in
didn't mention that problem now they do

492
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,880
on I get said I got many false negatives
of the recommended default threshold of

493
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,000
8.5

494
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,669
I that way too I never even got closer
match Unohana

495
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:05,260
at some point files was pretty good
pacify had 7.5 for a show like that no

496
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,590
real false Matt positive but then he
will extensive testing

497
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,659
on and so for same

498
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:15,309
people you know I you know I definitely
saw system to work and you know which is

499
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,370
I just had to get some got 19 value

500
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,059
so for the same person I got mashed race
between seven and nine different people

501
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:26,200
typically saw you know five-and-a-half
27 yes even see

502
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,370
system color doesn't match up with
people as long as you have good quality

503
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:36,370
images

504
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,420
arm

505
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,200
but let's move on out away from the so
the techie cited

506
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,950
things answer looking at the system
issues here on

507
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,420
in order for the face recognition face
recognition system the spot

508
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,580
terrace at the airport you had to build
a database is the bad guys

509
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,990
so our that's an immediate problem here

510
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,560
we think about home but say okay to my
as

511
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,000
today I was just reading the newspaper
5,000 members

512
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,230
that are still in Pakistan com

513
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,620
the the question is is this

514
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,890
we're gonna get the pictures for those
people mean

515
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,540
they're not exactly lining up to have
their pictures taken you know you have a

516
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,639
pitcher been logged

517
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,170
we have pitchers have his this
lieutenants

518
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,060
but is here I seriously doubt we have
pitchers are those other five thousand

519
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,710
members

520
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,710
so to the system to catch the terrorists
that the airport

521
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,300
um doesn't seem possible because we're
just not going to have the pictures for

522
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,050
those people

523
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,399
so this idea they were in the UC system
shares as it seems very reasonable

524
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,430
I'll now is to go to the ER September 11
hijackers

525
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,480
I'll week they actually do

526
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,580
two of them were suspected terrorist so

527
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,120
you know how little better luck there
there was a kind in a while

528
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,310
us army and co-lead I'll parliament are

529
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,010
and they may have I wrote here they have
photos

530
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,210
one up on the play as far as a tool what
happened is in late nineteen ninety 90

531
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,180
observe these two guys in Malaysia

532
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,430
I'll having the meeting someone who is
known to be a member of

533
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,800
Qaeda and this is the Malaysian other

534
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,460
you know intelligence folks you know
observe this mean it recorded

535
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,130
there were probably pitchers from a
meeting but not 100 percent sure

536
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,590
but haha hijackers had they were allowed

537
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,890
in this country after that meeting on

538
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,060
and they actually entered the the
country twice the left and came back

539
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,700
again

540
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,300
on now what's sort of interesting here

541
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:51,300
if you want if I knew of

542
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,520
on

543
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,720
he was pretty easy to find as the white
page in the phone book

544
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,350
palm so this this idea that we are
facing missions as the catch is that

545
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,320
seems kinda silly

546
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,270
at four so what happened was a CAA
recognize this guy was probably in their

547
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,050
terminology

548
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,520
dirty near in the year two thousand they
didn't hole

549
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,719
let the FBI and INS now until August

550
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,919
a 2001 so for 18 months he's got a
running around known dirty guys but for

551
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,379
some reason the CIA did

552
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,520
did mention this to anyone on buttface
Canyon Mine parties guys it was possible

553
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,969
you know which should discount that but
this phone other ways

554
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:33,200
catches guys you know beforehand

555
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,350
on

556
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,360
some things about setting up a scanning
systems the airport

557
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,010
I wrote this before they it's all the
systems and it turns out the rules are

558
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,659
exactly what they did you gently can use
existing set sail scammers you need to

559
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,970
set up new cameras

560
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,200
you've got to have a walkway where the
system is years

561
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,250
were lighting a strictly control there's
no windows is best way to do it and

562
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,750
split in artificial I'm

563
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,640
on and then you force people to walk and
a single file line

564
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,770
and cameras must be kinda head

565
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:13,700
you know it at head to head height he
should I walk into a wall with cameras

566
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,820
and and passengers muscle strain

567
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,300
and a guy with sunglasses and then

568
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,610
he human being that when you get ahead
to verify okay with two people here that

569
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,610
the computer says match to the really
matter actually need really have been a

570
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,200
backup

571
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,230
on night ended a airport security
conference two weeks ago or three weeks

572
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,620
ago where is the onyx

573
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,750
made a presentation to installation at
statue Liberty

574
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,850
on over we can win or some terrorists

575
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,440
been terrorist threats against statue
Liberty and

576
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,590
the John from the CRS describe the set
up there

577
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,840
so I could enable those less site hey
there even professionally installed on

578
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,400
the system so you can just see

579
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,870
from from just using the software that
the systems are

580
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,620
earlier work and a DVD need has special
care

581
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,859
this is the simplest they had now

582
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,810
when we get into I when we get into

583
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,900
a the actor see question

584
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,160
up which was asked earlier on

585
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,379
overall my guess is if you had a scare
us walk through any had

586
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,010
good hit %um good pitches %uh them in
the database that you have about a 50

587
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,470
percent chance of getting a match

588
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,910
the vendors claim or around like many
percent

589
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,600
but it feels more like 15 these files
fell

590
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,759
at the a international by net mentors
crew

591
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,880
the vendor id: ok cold conditions is in
six assistant succeeded in identifying

592
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,810
individuals from getting database

593
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:53,020
on a little more than half the time to
vendors are claiming like ninety percent

594
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,330
independent Esther seen the end up
around 50 percent but that his

595
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,120
is predicated on one very important
thing he can control everything at the

596
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,900
airport

597
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,600
but he gotta have good pitchers at the
terrorist

598
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,690
and you don't control that situation not
even let you know even if you've got a

599
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,490
pitcher at the terrace it doesn't mean
it's going to be up to the standard

600
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,820
being able to that database work well so
that so that's why this is effing

601
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,520
a/c unit good guy system reducing access
control we allow somebody go through the

602
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,080
door

603
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,620
you enrolling them into the system and

604
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,980
you control both sets of photos you know
when they're at the doors walls and then

605
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,630
roll to different different problem

606
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,810
but when you're looking for terrace you
don't control a speech to the database

607
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,580
was extremely interesting years there's
been about a half a dozen

608
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,049
Chester these these systems at airports
I actually

609
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,760
got scanned at Boston Logan Airport
because I set one up for the

610
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,200
the order love it so I was flying out to
Salt Lake and I got scan their

611
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,860
on the I the way they test the systems
is they put in their

612
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,530
into their quote-unquote that got data
basic rates and had a bad guy database

613
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,090
which I understand as they just download
pictures from the FBI website like I did

614
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,350
so the relatively small few hundred 300
photos

615
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,100
but then they take input employees at
the airport into the database also

616
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,790
but actually tried at least SS is an
actual trying to catch it but its key

617
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,660
statistics

618
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,950
and so they put in pitchers have
employees in these databases and they

619
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,480
measure

620
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,270
you know the count how many times a
recognize employees course those

621
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,880
pictures

622
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,220
employees are good control pitchers turn
on what you have for terrorists

623
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,110
so they claim all these great your
success rates in the United percent but

624
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,600
it's kinda

625
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,069
cope with cookbooks I am in my opinion
nice talking with someone who actually

626
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,500
is supervising some other stuff who
works

627
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,750
for the TSA the group this looking at

628
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,110
putting the system said this is how you
had done it to

629
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:52,510
said the same I same saint petersburg
they they put in the cops into the

630
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,190
database

631
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,180
and Turkish is exactly the same place at
the same cameras that they use for

632
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,759
scanning

633
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,750
natchez not only what the way it is for
terrace so the one needs to be very

634
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,900
skeptical longer

635
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:09,900
hear about the singer

636
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,210
right %uh and that any

637
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,349
any customized under here thanks

638
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:37,099
%uh yeah things up you get that means I
think that and that's exactly the point

639
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:38,999
years if you start looking at all this

640
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:42,569
you're gonna suck you we maybe it's all
the systems in airports

641
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:46,910
and we can catch terrorists with
embedded that same thing doesn't we

642
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,328
definitely have much shots

643
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:52,089
%uh local bad guys so that's who opposed
to the database

644
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,499
and it'll be just like the Super Bowl
but we have

645
00:39:55,499 --> 00:40:00,559
a you know we just simply use the
airport is a convenient place the low

646
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,420
round up the usual suspects and this is
exactly the point that I made in Logan

647
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,039
Airport

648
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,369
what I said presented to them acid is
Logan Airport

649
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:12,680
right place to be look you know rounding
up the local bank robbers you have

650
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,649
enough problems security already

651
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,759
you want to take on a whole other local
police tomorrow

652
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:20,940
and in the answer what they said was a
health

653
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,490
had a head at Logan Airport says yeah we
don't care that's a you know that sounds

654
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,170
fine dust

655
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,369
ices the reason that we want these
systems and

656
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:32,930
is for the term effect that the next
time that there's a hijacking it isn't

657
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,339
that from Bossier paper

658
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:38,430
for because the bad guys that we have
this isn't a catcher and

659
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:43,269
that seems to be at the same sentiment
was echoed at this airport security

660
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:44,609
conference that I wanted

661
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,078
that is more scared people than than
anything else is

662
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,640
is is a bad guys think it's gonna work
another the stairwell

663
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,259
in that they may have had they met there
may be something to that I don't say

664
00:40:55,259 --> 00:40:56,079
that its wholly

665
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,829
total votes: but what I do you think is
the systems as far as catching

666
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:00,890
terrorists go

667
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,960
probably aren't going to work is going
to be much more

668
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,119
let's just logo you'll obey robbers or

669
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,319
day dacha whatever the size Prime
Minister who who were gonna

670
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:17,319
who are you going with the sisters yeah
Adam cable difficult

671
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,549
are supposedly casinos are using this a
lot

672
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:27,809
years past stage this

673
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:31,180
special status of National get I said

674
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,239
yes Chiefs for raided another another
guy ed

675
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,259
another guys will have no effect because
I was perfect timing

676
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:44,450
that up I think the casinos if you look
at that application it really shows you

677
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,269
how technology is fine the ecological
niche

678
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:51,319
on that face recognition has all the
certs

679
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:54,690
problems or limitations are so

680
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,210
the casinos with they bought into the
idea of a scanning to look for

681
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:03,950
you know known she's so what they do is
the casinos get together they build a

682
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,660
database of all the bad guy

683
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,970
weapons are the cheats now leading cause
I'll show you why

684
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:13,200
midwifery quotes and they have companies
who run the systems with them

685
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,309
so are for them you talk to see you
might pay twenty thousand dollars a year

686
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,690
to run the service

687
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,739
but if the as long as it

688
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:26,349
if it's awesome million dollars with
cheating it's paid for itself

689
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:29,549
the RR of that is quite good and so

690
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:34,089
for their standpoint there's work of
Statistics so even if this system only

691
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:36,460
has 10 percent that she's a walk anybody

692
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,529
you have to be higher because if you
control the pitchers want people on the

693
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:41,059
database it should be higher

694
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,599
it's just something like that get return
on investment know what's interesting

695
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,380
about the systems as well

696
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,420
late well who goes ahead database and
I'm

697
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,749
you know who like who decides well you
certainly he got somebody is stealing

698
00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:55,140
chips on the table

699
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,089
or you know it how you know you what's
the Discovery Channel HA all those cheap

700
00:42:59,089 --> 00:42:59,450
you know

701
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,450
you know cheap physical cheater the
graph circular cross you know so we can

702
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,089
say well those are okay

703
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:08,558
within but they also consider car
cameras crux

704
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,660
in car trailer to serve the people who
know how to play blackjack betting that

705
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,730
the scene and us

706
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,859
and they're labeled by the casino
sprouts and they get you know excluded

707
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:19,670
from going in and playing blackjack

708
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,789
and so you can really see you know this
release

709
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:27,859
uncertain the inserts a civil rights
issue cited the same here

710
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:31,549
is is left to the casinos and you know
they're asleep

711
00:43:31,549 --> 00:43:34,749
people that I don't think should be
excluded units because have to memorize

712
00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:36,059
cards in your head

713
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:39,849
you learn how to suck at least mas your
head you know on the right and the bad

714
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:40,489
not bad

715
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:43,499
that doesn't seem like she to me so

716
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:49,690
anywhere using this is the keepers and
people are a civil rights attorney

717
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,970
December misuse the system are just
learning thing ever

718
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:57,170
white-collar criminals to the database a
lot of CEOs not be able to

719
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:04,170
take their place anymore yeah great
place around the block but not because

720
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,519
that's his body of this people file

721
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,849
brother South billion but no that's the
point is these systems

722
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:14,140
on finally gets down to who gets to make
that decision

723
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,799
because in database you know what's the
the legal standard for putting people in

724
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:18,210
there

725
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,960
in a mostly talk about yes people who
are

726
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,390
wanted you know four you know jumping
bail for this an outstanding arrest

727
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,788
warrant for them

728
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,750
it is not you know with the session one
thing I heard your city it's not for

729
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,539
people just known to be bad

730
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:36,859
as people who actually you know they're
looking for but also opens up

731
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:40,759
to of for misuse my personal experience
with it in use

732
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:44,559
the tissues videotapes is a
demonstration by the City Hall

733
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,329
me off %uh in Sin City Hall New York and
they use

734
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:53,160
videos of past administrations in a
thought the quote someone that was

735
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,019
supposedly being a public haha
unfortunately

736
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:59,519
demonstrators got hold of me about the
massive as the National Lawyers Guild

737
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,269
way down to the police station and the
two cocks the holding the minute he even

738
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:04,989
look

739
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:08,519
like the guy in the video with a
spokesman for the system with a police

740
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:09,210
lineup

741
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,039
and for sure he was really nice but this
could be really use just harass people

742
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,069
to stop them like ours missing what
flights whatever

743
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:21,038
yeah it's to me is very scary that's
another techno fixin

744
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,170
yeah we have to be wary of misuses

745
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,420
right here there's no doubt about these
a

746
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,440
depending on what level they get put
into a

747
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,489
you know tim has some very very you know
really bad effects

748
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:38,019
on mean that's that's that's what my
concern is in they're going under the

749
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:39,980
guise of the Los

750
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,920
page keeping us safe from terrorists but
that is all they can be used that way

751
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,440
the other part in this too is somebody
travels on airplanes a lot

752
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,200
others to error rates that we need to
talk about we were talking about the

753
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,230
system's

754
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:57,400
one is the the you miss somebody that's
really the bad guy

755
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,759
but then the other reverses the finger
somebody and say this is a bad guy

756
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:06,589
money really is so the question is what
happens in that situation how do you

757
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,619
handle it well the first thing you do is
you need a human being

758
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:14,119
to go and nm agitation sale yet they
looked like to look the same

759
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,710
well then what you do you know if they
do you mean you know the human beings is

760
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,480
a mess and you need to send

761
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,519
some security people over and talk to
that person

762
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,630
well what a few runs or whatever you
know you know there's a lot of what ifs

763
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,069
here

764
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:31,029
how you handle that situation and and he
can be pretty disruptive at the airport

765
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:35,279
he have to consider that the number
terror certainly want to it

766
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:38,690
through the airport there are going to
be the database is gonna be in 1 $500

767
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:39,819
million maybe

768
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:43,420
but the number of false positives you're
going to get is about one person

769
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:48,140
the system business offers to say about
once once every one or two airplanes is

770
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,038
is the rating error rates

771
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:53,640
there around anywhere close to half a
percent of the two percent

772
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,808
see how this whole question of you know
love other

773
00:46:56,809 --> 00:47:00,880
you know one or two planeloads of
somebody being figured as a terrorist

774
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,960
and so you start thinking about that
what's gonna happen is it

775
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,900
that the security people just don't give
up on this is a lot of people go because

776
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,160
they'd there they're never going to see
a terror syndicate seeing all these

777
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,368
all the system causing crime were off so
there's a lot of variation policies

778
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:17,200
decisions that have to be worked out

779
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,960
and this came up with this airplane
security happens people design

780
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,749
securities

781
00:47:20,749 --> 00:47:24,339
sure boards in similar kinds of systems
have various

782
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:27,999
have similar problems so it's it's not
hot dry hey make these things were

783
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,999
yeah to have the

784
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:35,070
on twins or family members PCs

785
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,390
official its a

786
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,660
I her ok it's has

787
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,759
I'm sorry it happened but that's another
good one to run the right to sleep on a

788
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,120
twin

789
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:51,480
to questions about you okay how
susceptible system to disguise another

790
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,430
countermeasures

791
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,750
well the the at the clearness

792
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,070
your sunglasses you know a kills it but
if you add a fake beard on or whatever

793
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,530
that should its is it physical area Faso

794
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:07,890
it you know like a fake nose but i
thinkI people can notice it

795
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,509
now that when they were

796
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:17,550
now sneeze

797
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:22,220
the still this discussion they on the
things differently when you're talking

798
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:22,510
about

799
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,170
seems is on ongoing theme

800
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,780
in American public life is the
privatization of previously public

801
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,110
spaces like malls

802
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,700
am wondering what if any protections in
place for

803
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,000
images collected in public spaces or
dislike was in public spaces like malls

804
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,020
what are these images gone once the
system's

805
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,580
got a picture him walking to the airport
with the access changes behind that the

806
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,390
security company and then

807
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:52,089
okay well in the the face recognition
systems

808
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,130
what is the onyx lots to say is

809
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,500
a no match no no memory they
automatically discard the image after

810
00:48:59,500 --> 00:48:59,950
that

811
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:06,170
however you know for a in general for
CCTV systems a security cameras

812
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,810
in general there's is usually a recorded
on some

813
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,270
I never you no slouch a slow a

814
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:19,300
v VHS tape in illegally special VHS
recorders that say that sucks away

815
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,250
it in general %uh you know it's in the
security department have the states they

816
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,900
they might recycle once every few weeks
once every few months depending on the

817
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,680
on the retention policy the company

818
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,730
after that the discarded on so

819
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,710
you know the bad news yet assess your
images say the law

820
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,880
%uh but that's that is the good news is
nobody

821
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,120
actually almost ever looks at them that
there are no human being actually is is

822
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,920
looking at them

823
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,510
that's what's interesting about face
recognition is now you have a computer

824
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,100
that actually and look at the

825
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,480
mean that the images yes you can imagine
also to Big Brother applications for

826
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,620
this stuff way beyond what these
companies are currently talking about

827
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,020
now

828
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,280
it's very very intersting there's an
article in the New York on Sunday

829
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,130
magazine

830
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:08,150
were the gentleman and just Vatican

831
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,570
who is president of the onyx said don't
worry

832
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:14,720
will never go the really bad route on
the system's

833
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,540
because I want right I will write the
software to to make this happen

834
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,060
and unite a level

835
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,290
you know this is a very arrogant his
first saying you know I

836
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:30,259
you know I'm no I and the neverland Big
Brother I'm not gonna do bad things and

837
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,280
I'm a techie am in control here

838
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,510
you know don't were on in pretty clearly

839
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:40,200
I there are some very interesting policy
decisions need to be made about the

840
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,010
system's

841
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:44,230
are in this time you know I

842
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:48,350
skeptical do that seem to be having more
towards a lot more surveillance

843
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,620
but this play is you know problems such
as general surveillance cams

844
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:57,170
you know today South we got five minutes
so that

845
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:04,170
time for a few more questions

846
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,269
T

847
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:17,039
on PC

848
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,910
since more

849
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:25,509
over lines subsidized research

850
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:30,309
sconce large systems and then ask them
to bring products to market

851
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:33,769
proceeded to test the product some Hans

852
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:36,970
33 Sturgis just

853
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:40,400
and did Barbie

854
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,660
spread mission gender tests ask results

855
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,759
sucks showers

856
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:53,849
see see procedures

857
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:58,140
from apps

858
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,359
they just

859
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,589
the only fibers original 3 dropped out

860
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,749
they're running again finished

861
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:11,869
s results website this is the

862
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:15,109
this this we'll see

863
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:18,739
this year this fifty companies

864
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:25,319
this just are to

865
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:29,140
CEO two companies see

866
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,859
its tells he retired

867
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:36,049
posts

868
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:40,859
coach term products

869
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,090
that's

870
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,480
fortunes stance the

871
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,580
this test a very interesting because
this is a tent

872
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,240
about to do a systematic study these
systems I'll

873
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,160
how long lines that I was doing the air
looking at various

874
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,100
no false-positive false negative rates
the effects that lighting he said two

875
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,560
things

876
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,770
now was gonna be interesting here's on
when the vendors when the results come

877
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,130
out they're gonna continue my penis
result

878
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,190
on their uses other this test is a

879
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,230
as as an amo to say hey we're ready to
go on airports now

880
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:20,010
I know that's going to happen are why I
think this tester probably gonna have

881
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:23,600
not be applicable for the terrorists
application is the

882
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,450
really look you're not really getting
into this question of how to pitch in

883
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:26,890
tears

884
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:33,890
we have one other quality those bitches

885
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,620
yeah

886
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:50,040
yeah there's an actress special really
really love him

887
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:56,340
that and that's all that's like a
lawnmower but yeah

888
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,310
II scene also US Army test was done this
is done more informally

889
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:04,390
and they were sisters similar similar
kinds results here

890
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:08,600
and that's thinking after have to fight
so that part time for one more question

891
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,200
here

892
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,200
yeah okay I don't know if your
intentions to the game

893
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:22,000
halfway through but I'll I do remember
reading something in the New York Times

894
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,080
vaults

895
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,120
a England in this specifically London

896
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,790
for the most part talking about their
implementation cameras

897
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:33,840
all over the city and the they I guess
they've been doing it for

898
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,130
quite a few years now these two years
because they're really afraid of

899
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,140
terrorism

900
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,500
no in all our problems are limited one
thing that they said is that in three

901
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,490
years

902
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,550
%uh the only people they've ever caught
are

903
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,630
you know known criminals who looked a
little pale the burglaries

904
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:55,740
weather looking for those terrorists but
almost all the terrorists the

905
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,150
you know that we do it suicide bombings
it was the first crime

906
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,870
that is so yeah it in three years I have
been caught nobody

907
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:08,060
yeah that I mean its agenda the UK is

908
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,410
have been on the vanguard a solid
security cameras its was in the early

909
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,460
nineties it was related I R

910
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:18,840
IRA bombings of in in there are there is
a face scanning system in 10 the town

911
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,830
squares in England but they're mostly
just

912
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:24,860
installing regulars old security saddam
security cameras if you will

913
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,370
rather than smart security cameras like
this other is one place where they've

914
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:28,790
done it

915
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:33,110
these young sluts have crime went down
in that area it's unclear why

916
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:36,850
on that they never caught anybody you
know with assistance

917
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:41,259
okay thank you very much again my left
side is computer bites man I do have

918
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,360
more information out there

919
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,170
face kenny also because it's

920
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,310
on
