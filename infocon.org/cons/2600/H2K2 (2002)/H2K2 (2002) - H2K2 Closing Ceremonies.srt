do you guys rock

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,190
so i think our our jobs for me so much
easier by the attendees who helped us

25
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,620
out every step of the way and he has a
lot of work involved in the a fifty

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,070
thousand square feet to deal with

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,530
middlemen hatton street-level

28
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,110
call kinds of things could have happened
and ah...

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,090
we we made it uh... we made it work
really really well

30
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,870
the panels are great people were

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,430
were interesting on

32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,680
they're very stop it to be discussed and
that the crowds everybody comet and how

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,020
great the crowds were how interested
they weren't things

34
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,740
interested in something that

35
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,970
i think

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,780
i think the whole conferences have had a
good history with that kind of thing and

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,989
that's why i hope we we're able to
continue

38
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:20,989
and our plans to do this again two years

39
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,189
her

40
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,969

what would never go back to earth

97
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,429
with dot

98
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,009
where there will be a link

99
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,050
it completely

100
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,680
it can't be too dot

101
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,020
like to have a good bit betty no medlar

102
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,558
the dignity of it

103
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:49,559
other correct

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,280

106
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:07,759
email catcher

107
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,759
emailed hopefully

108
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,629
who's responsible for

109
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,899
you're getting in here frankly isn't
managed registration

110
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,069
which i gotta say with manage very well

111
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,050
and uh... we had two houses badges to t

112
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,789
to distribute and at complicate things
we'd fight streets

113
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,748
which will probably go to a later date
how how that was arrived at

114
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,709
but uh... gesture whatever

115
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,689
nightmares that you did you have to
overcome to uh... to make all that

116
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:54,689
happened registration

117
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,479
greatly gettle

118
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,149
everyone either one

119
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:08,469
dispersed out or actually i think

120
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:15,469
bibi bibi bibi

121
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,869
if you were here in nineteen ninety four

122
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:23,690
allies

123
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,509
finger registration then

124
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:29,270
that was something that's a first time
we did it we had no was going on so

125
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,229
uh... yeah and uh... to uh... to the
registration forms

126
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:34,090
getting it done right this year

127
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,669
we've heard from other states every
single time it's just going to get

128
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,919
better

129
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,359
happy registration being

130
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,749
notes keeps improving settler

131
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:49,139
never go back to play with press
conferences one will be getting better

132
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,370
it will look

133
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,479
uh... come together and email exam that
uh...

134
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,190
wheatley stuck to a low-tech
distribution system you could have some

135
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:07,379
pretty banter have people looked up
cuter frankly i think people your wife

136
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:14,379
we did that for your privacy

137
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:18,729
i don't see uh... roddy up here but i
think really begin for security for

138
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:25,729
really doing a great job this year

139
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,720
procure make it

140
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,480
place running smoothly they kept things
here and they uh...

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,610
basically

142
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,740
we break they were nicer human beings
are part of us which is what it's all

143
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,110
about

144
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,100
re we take care of ourselves

145
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,149
uh... we on the outside influences

146
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:43,929
we're uh...

147
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,149
you know we're working meeting and i
think they'd be

148
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,930
who personify victory

149
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,170
uh... animus here from uh... the network
peru

150
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:57,069
theater-goers know how that worked up
and up

151
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,900
well i wish the network for a little
supports move them

152
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,650
it was

153
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,520
or at least asking that was last year
minds t one

154
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,870
t one worked great but they'll couple of
really

155
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,950
czar logistical problems we have

156
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,040
last night we got punched holes

157
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,439
i think uh... next year's net

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,430
each ticket for

159
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,900
who have ah...

160
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,660
britain will do better

161
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,610
joe palca sent the commands

162
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,940
it in advance to actually tested those
probably problem

163
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,720
as far as getting network wanting

164
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,850
deletes think that the other guys

165
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,880
and treatment u

166
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,330
split special frank and i see people

really meeting or two

170
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,090

spark it's moving webserver

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,900
and stuff so

175
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,550
that was pretty decent

176
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,430

issues in predetermine

183
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,900
it's probably the biggest challenge of
running a conference just to to keep the

184
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,860
whites keep the speakers keep that
microphones give everything working all

185
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,930
at the same time

186
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,470

187
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,240
uh... so again thanks so much for for
volunteering in being part of that

things drop from holland who are

211
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,410
inspired us with oh... galactic pack a
party and b_t_u_ and all those other

212
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,579
recovers as really suggest people get
out to don't just go to the conferences

213
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,720
here in the states

214
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,870
next year is going to be something in
germany

215
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,870
which will be heavily involved in

216
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,010
three years they'll be another one in
holland

217
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,240
and uh... those are the ones that really
inspired us to putting together here in

218
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,180
this country sab got together

219
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,430
that the community

220
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,490
and really uh...

221
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,130
progress learned things got together

222
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,590
so i think we'll take care

223
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,590
meat

224
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,830
lead a fairly modest

225
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,330
whatever experience we could offer

226
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,780
little things that might help

227
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,620
what we need to realize

228
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,970
realizes

229
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,220
but it's a circle it's a circle that
that those people organizing stuff

230
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,300
coming meeting

231
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,440
up to some of these issues that we

232
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,740
going out of organizing stuff on their
own realizing that some parts of that

233
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,590
circle of really good

234
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,520
in the end of may turn out to

235
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,720
one person

236
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,270
stacy manual

237
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,610
maxi got his credit cards risking his

238
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,560
things mortgage payments or whatever

239
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,590
to get this thing

240
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,800
going trying to keep it going

241
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,140
or a small group

242
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,680
the skill set it takes to

243
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,750
just sent a payment

244
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,680
to do things for this

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,540
people together

246
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,839
then by all means do we need

247
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,800
meaning together

248
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,060
possess these skills organization

249
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,600
business sense

250
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,030
any of these same important skills took
to get the

251
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,060
things like this billing just completely

252
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,480
complete ignorance of personal risks

253
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,750
go for it

254
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:25,750
do things like this that's

255
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,039
it's great that security through our who

all

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
many people here had a good time

260
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,910
that's what counts make how many people
had a really good time

261
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,730
and

262
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,230
clearly to encourage these guys to do
this again

263
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,550
we need to have another one of these
products

264
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,370
hatred i would like to out

265
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,990
tell you that

266
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,700
the only pranks and gone on let's say
you were

267
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,750
maybe a couple of tagging incidents in
the end of the day

268
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,470
the letters from downstairs got stolen
by

269
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,210
you distracted the security team that's
one of one them

270
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,790
uh... yeah

271
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,050
we were killed by kids that was the only
thing they could figure to spell out

272
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,690
what the letters

273
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,360
why do the security force to point b_
camp near the tapes

274
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,180
from the cameras

275
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,690
that were in the elevators

276
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,550
that was like

277
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,580
i'd say maybe about an hour

278
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,850
lots of help

279
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,890
but other than that it was great we've
gotten all the radios back

280
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,519
shearson

281
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,620
real happy about that

282
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,900
and nothing else so far it's been a
while

283
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,060
maybe a couple of you lost items

284
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,500
other than that it was a break calmer

285
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,500
so you want to do this again

286
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,460
took her first so we are so that they go
tell which i think really had a really

287
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,090
whatever wafer

288
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,710
the reverse this time

289
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,470
elders actually worked

290
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,300
way organizing safely get together with
them bit there you see where the normal

291
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,589
conferences

292
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,740
what can you be running from nine to
five what what you want

293
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,050
that's strange

294
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,560
but they worked with us uh...

295
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,400
you know would not like any other
conferences place has ever seen

296
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,240
they accepted that accepted aunts and
make it was the space we need literally

297
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,630
it worked out great

298
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,910
really work that grace i think uh... we
owe the hotel the ground because and i

299
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,910
think this place

300
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,070
assorted throughout somebody else was
being here perilously throughout the

301
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,579
entire weekend great newbie who is uh...

302
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,569
greatest

303

making sure things run smoothly and all
different areas

304
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,690

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,940
some well

308
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,760
people are so willing

309
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,140
staples

310
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:47,140
gets down level

311
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,490
pfizer

312
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:59,490
next slide

313
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:12,230
and they are the speakers

314
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,210
couple of other routes

315
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,110
but was simply yet speakers

316
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,580
uh... the speakers that we have had a
manual them

317
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,080
well over seventy because accounting the
third tractor a lot of people in there

318
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,740
doing kings as well

319
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,309
it was just amazing nobody cancelled and
you know there is none of these uh...

320
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,559
holes in the schedule everybody should
have a very good

321
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,399
i think a really good job in your

322
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,930
of any panel where the person did a
lousy job

323
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,980
it was great we're in communication with
them out

324
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,679
months before hand weeks months before
hand getting things together

325
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,600
i think that's what i think if i was
really well the only complete so i heard

326
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,390
was that there is too much good stuff
and it's happening at the same time you

327
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:54,390
couldn't get through it all

328
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,680

uh... or keep using at risk assessments
a

370
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,010
strategy but in any case

371

be configured that used to work

372
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,310

381
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,539
anyhow i'm

382
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,940
argued for weeks how we're going to

383
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,610
right wrist levels signed what
back-to-basics weakest but the point of

384
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,490
view

385
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,330
so well

386
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,260
if you look at your pet also others
couple things i want to point out to you

387
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,350
mag stripe on the back

388
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,480
with some liberally chosen to

389
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,680
publicized wanted figured out on usable
at your hotel

390
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,890
uh... to same type retract straight
hotsync level culver city and uh...

391
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,260
underway if you still have a romantic
checked out here

392
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,000
that front desk and i have been encoded

393
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,190
essentially here

394
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,340
course the technician insert the right
way

395
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,070
i saw several people you three sticking
to that his has been

396
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,600
there's also a chip on his part

397
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,020
you can't figure out what that's for
yourself that sort of a something been

398
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,650
you can just write figure

399
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,340
what purpose that might have and uh...

400
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,790
yet we had a ill effects

401
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,770
ed every it's less than markets and
seattle

402
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,350
who uh... was on our design team

403
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,840
mail myself and it came up with these
designs

404
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,580
definetly using the brain dot that was
pretty ritualistic featured side

405
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,179
agreement shit implant

406
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,149
but we thought this kind of a better
word ship

407
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:03,240
linked to the brain

408
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,419
redistricting

409
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:07,660
also at the front of the batch there is
a hidden message

410
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,490
but you're not gonna be although it's
not human readable bt orkut message

411
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,549
so budget axes orkut readers through the
day

412
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:19,370
it right because that as anyone not
conference decoder that park again

413
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,310
not a one i've got a couple of market
because down in the year

414
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,350
rector competing area and i went back to

415
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,700
or i couldn't find somebody keys

416
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,549
so what would my give we had a few extra

417
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,110
we didn't have enough postage frankly we
don't have time to put them

418
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,380
wanna get these way

419
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,720
is and that you probably noticed the

420
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,640
national security agency here

421
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,720
military

422
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,330
infos acting for security purposes and
put around the escalators

423
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,810
uh... you can't get there should be in a
second try

424
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,810
leading date yet they're only getting
into

425
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,190
military uh...

426
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,900
military agencies

427
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:02,420
thanks to just let ours

428
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,809
some people think those were uh... those
who are

429
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,760
posters that we made as a telling people
that uh... to me

430
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,340
security begins with you

431
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,850
yet we might believe that but we would
never come up with something such easy

432
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,840
is that

433
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,780
this can only

434
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,389
but it looks like straight out of the
nineteen fifties

435
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,740
but we couldn't get these ourselves we
have to basically take this from their

436
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,900
website

437
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,510
and um...

438
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,650
uh... jeff lasted an amazing job reserve
for their amazing job

439
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,430
steve

440
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,670
interested there

441
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,020
because we've never believed that this
is something that was taken off the

442
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,250
website like that

443
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,890
thanks thanks to him now everyone has
seen it

444
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,780
and daddies are actually actual posters
from the n_s_a_ also there were a

445
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
uh... we could make out the yes

446
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,910
uh... one of the logos the bottom of the
singer place to be a huge pages

447
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,919
therefore to parity and therefore we
don't violate any

448
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,919
in copyright

449
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,839
uh... some of the vendors who came here

450
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,800
uh... were generous enough to you

451
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,080
give us some of the things they were
selling

452
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,530
yet we've got a pile of stuff up here
also riley associates uh... it's never

453
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,210
been here but uh... obviously is a big
supporter of the actor community

454
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,110
publications

455
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,170
uh... again as they did eighty k

456
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,770
status and i certainly oppose pictures

457
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,070
so well we want make sure the people get
those

458
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,889
and uh... we're gonna have to figure out
some fair way to do this so

459
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,830
the badges uh... all have unique serial
numbers on them so

460
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,280
get out your badges

461
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,500
but you have to be where he was really a
year

462
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,750
and uh...

463
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,290
let's just uh...

464
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,020
start out with that

465
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,940
about the last two digits will start
with the last week in a single disk

466
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,870

uh... above liquidity that's prolly got

471
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,290

many of us know by harding which has
been

it was already a m

721
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,579
