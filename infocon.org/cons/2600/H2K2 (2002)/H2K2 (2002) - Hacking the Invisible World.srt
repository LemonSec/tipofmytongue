1
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,560
up

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,549
I wanna thank God tom is i com were
could be here for coming up with the

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,630
idea for the spam

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,099
yes top it's primarily about how to
extend our

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,860
limited senses to be able to see and
hear things in the Nam

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,260
can around us and waterways

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,989
to do that some legal some not so labels

8
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:42,100
discussions for I educational purposes
only

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,629
our a letter other voted against
themselves

10
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,260
and we can start the hacking the
invisible world

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,000
one

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
K

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,960
I

14
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,810
founders respective Leiser like to

15
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,110
explore what's actually happening around
and sometimes you're running real

16
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,630
interesting

17
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,840
there's a

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,039
there's a whole lot of stuff going on
around is it isn't immediately apparent

19
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,350
and that's all falls under what's called
the

20
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,900
electromagnetic spectrum basically
everything you see here

21
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,820
and radio is a is a traveling through
the air obviously

22
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,320
and it's a different frequencies what
you see on that on the chart here

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,380
United States frequency allocations

24
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,730
the Department of Commerce in this
country

25
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,880
a regulating dictates who can who can
use what frequencies for what purposes

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,730
and this goes all the way from very very
low frequencies which

27
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,380
are sometimes used by submarines for
communicating

28
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,100
to their home base a way up to

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,780
light frequencies and frequencies are
well above visible light so we're gonna

30
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,430
we're gonna cover the gamut from a from
the left to

31
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,440
to be online like x-rays

32
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,320
microwaves thats or anything I I

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,519
I'm I'll probably start are in order of
frequency

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,640
I guess it seems to make more sense
wanna start at the high end ago downer

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,920
bottom-up or already there

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,660
3 can you scan the left a letter to the
beginning a

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:27,660
making it the left frequencies

38
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,090
I don't use that sorry

39
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,140
barrier from your experiences monitoring
I know you're you're a fan of the higher

40
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,800
frequencies

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,140
but a what a what extremely low

42
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,269
he left for the love frequencies
applications have you

43
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,319
come across well not

44
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,780
lots inside don't like to listen 30
makers

45
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,349
okay I i listen to navigational beacons

46
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,030
Witcher airport be considered broadcast
their

47
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,069
there are 3 letter airport designation
like JFK

48
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,480
in Morse code and it's a pretty
interesting these beacons up from

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,380
from all over the country because the
long-range travel a long distance

50
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,880
and it's pretty challenging because it
is very low frequencies your intent is

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,440
have to be

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,399
miles very very long you have to have a
resident in a bit helps

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,600
and we're talking the wavelength
literally miles

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,180
miles long particularly helpful for
submarines to

55
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,400
communicate because their underwater and
just because the way the frequencies

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,800
hey it's useful for getting getting
messages

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,350
suffering director they don't want and

58
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,090
locate the left frequencies a little bit
higher

59
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,440
go up to

60
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,990
under one megahertz about under
1,000,000 cycles per second

61
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,470
and then we go to medium wave
frequencies which everybody hears you

62
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,039
know you're with

63
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,270
medium wave often he referred to as a
a.m. AM radio band

64
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,340
broadcast band like a 1010 wins for
instance is about one

65
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,440
1 maker 1000 sorry one

66
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,830
killer 1000 hello 1,010 killers

67
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,159
which is a 1.01 megahertz and

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,000
help everybody listens to that more less
about that you can have the HR

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,830
frequencies which

70
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,590
gently go from about 3 to 30 megahertz

71
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,280
and there's a CB radios in their insurer
wave radio is in there

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,849
we get a couple panel discussions
including shortwave and a

73
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:32,680
we brought along a couple examples over
abuses shortwave

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,289
a respecter to bring her I can be a okay

75
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:40,330
well we have a a are you ready player
radio 1 at ten o'clock this morning

76
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,570
proposal walk in I I did have several
transmitters down there

77
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,180
buddies library operations and I do have
one year it's called a grenade

78
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,039
its a.m. transmitters or 10 what's
carrier

79
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,430
and will swing up for you what's several

80
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,560
local player several players use Caesars
control

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,570
its crystal controlled

82
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:10,570
only portable jail cell battery keep

83
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,140
projector yup pretty a pretty unassuming
box really

84
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,409
yes there is made by John about you
radio animal

85
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,289
said left radio Bobby really a
breadboard version in nineteen forties

86
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:25,650
to

87
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,030
transmitter year converted everything
over to solid-state

88
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,370
to protect his is working file all the

89
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,740
all the designators on all the

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,580
chips G everything inside everything she
can even

91
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,270
your yourself they're fun to play with
and share with

92
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,950
things there shortwave I play around
with their also

93
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,070
Oracle's by numbers stations is there

94
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,310
I'll army agencies from around the world

95
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,550
coated spy stations which are repeated

96
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,690
group numbers which are Inc co like the

97
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,330
number yep

98
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,280
or later group and the make up their
best

99
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,750
like that wheels a play around with them
you lower your

100
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,979
lot of people here obviously familiar
Rekha retiree

101
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,400
and that's a that's prolly want all
these uses a

102
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,599
cryptography in in

103
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,380
no in this century is a is a tripped
over

104
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,500
over shortwave that intelligent changes
around the world continue to use

105
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,380
short-wave is a

106
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,669
as a medium forgetting 50 messages to
their operatives in various countries

107
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,460
you can hear these messages anywhere
between three and three megahertz on a

108
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,180
standard sure we're at. with the cost
anywhere from

109
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,440
fifty dollars on up and in the coming
year Eagles hear these

110
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,960
5 five-member group being rate of you
we're going to try to hook up some

111
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
audience played

112
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,789
I'm sure in we can do that but in any
case at

113
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,719
its it's done with a like a one-time pad
encryption scheme he changes every day

114
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:03,539
and know is going to be cryptic because
it's a to new key every day

115
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,770
there's government agencies that the BSA

116
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,380
chris is a a the actually try to now
analyzes messages affair with what this

117
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,409
other countries sending to where's

118
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:19,419
we play around with that as well we
creator all and throw them on the years

119
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,089
famous on a US attention 69 which is a

120
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,570
I think version of the Spanish attention
numbers station which is all

121
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,810
by letters five numbers station in
Spanish

122
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,510
attention 69 you play right afterwards
or

123
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,640
in that time slot work normally appears
at a higher power level

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,669
just really is a keep them busy is

125
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,968
this particular transmitters only about
10 widespread it has reached

126
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,520
listeners about 500 miles away in
different directions

127
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,000
so it's a pretty surprising how much she
accomplish is a good book you can

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,839
you can if you wanna learn more about
your way passport the world band radio

129
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,070
highly recommended I think we ever gave
away this book

130
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,200
on off the hook its premium last year

131
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,020
and a it's a for Ethernet for 500 pages

132
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,740
going detail shortwave radio stations
around the world broadcast stations

133
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,630
usually stations which are intended for

134
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,380
private people listen to their like
governments communicating

135
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,149
that sort of thing butter there's a lot
of books on the subject here's a book

136
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,110
called the underground for 20 guide

137
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,490
you can do a search on the web for
keyword enigma

138
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,810
and the Finder to a group of people who

139
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,649
monitor these unusual short wave signals
and try to discover the origin

140
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,850
purvis your in numbers gathering

141
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,970
mathematical a now up to the VHF
frequencies which are commonly used by

142
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,120
paging companies and

143
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
police other starting move up in
frequency his band

144
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,770
dodge which is really late you operate
your Julia you know business

145
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,819
I complete dispatch taxicabs my use VHF

146
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,240
on amateur radio operators have the to
meet her hand and which is from 140 4140

147
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,620
e

148
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,630
makers in this country you can

149
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,670
here's an example other the receiver

150
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,620
it's capable tuning VHF frequencies all
the way up to

151
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,620
UHF frequencies

152
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,210
this is a JC the R five hundred about
the size of a pack of cigarettes

153
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,590
and fit easily in your pocket in Italy
receiver

154
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,900
all the way up to thirteen hundred
megahertz there's a VHF frequency and

155
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,380
there's the SPCA

156

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,320
near prison frequencies breakers so
forth one is thing about this radio is a

158
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,140
despite its low price a couple hundred
dollars

159
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,870
you can interfacing with the your PC and
in tears when is offering

160
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,890
42 I'm sorry a max offering your fortune
which is free

161
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,760
and you can Swofford files with people
around

162
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,930
around the world in if you're in the
traveling somewhere you can is down low

163
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,860
frequencies and have the program
restores a thousand this a

164
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,630
these frequencies are New York ariane
yet our item from a friend in

165
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,210
put them in there so was up here it was
going on around us

166
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,700
bear you starting getting here from your
specialities frequency range is a

167
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,030
UHF on up when you starts planning a

168
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:33,300
kinda stuff you are you here in Europe
UHF in about in the Netherlands

169
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,240
police use eighty maker which is really
low

170
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,530
people here even receive

171
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,280
because in the scanners full you can't
even receive

172
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,740
makers she was 30 makers and then again
and

173
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,160
going higher but in the Netherlands
police uses up till now

174
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,029
clear voice analog signaling

175
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,579
makers it's also because the Netherlands
is flat

176
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,860
makers makes perfect for

177
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,600
range communication between brings

178
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,120
but there now covering when Europe is
getting United

179
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,379
making digital system cool date

180
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,360
actually two systems and

181
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,709
its digitally scramble

182
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,680
communication network as

183
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,520
properties close the frequency hopping

184
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,329
it's not ones that general they're
really making work

185
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,190
people listening to police
communications getting that out of the

186
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,600
way

187
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,010
even for normal

188
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,460
police communications business that I
think should be open to the public

189
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,620
and

190
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,560
that's what's going on in and around the
Netherlands

191
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,199
this moment what are your feelings a you
just surtax on

192
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,790
your feelings regarding at the open is a
over to a radio communications very

193
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,769
I know in this country and Latta 14 said
she specialises in several events are

194
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:05,680
moving towards it

195
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,269
making their transmissions digital Spurs
analog and a

196
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,610
encrypting them as shit we as citizens

197
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,730
various countries pay for the systems
and pay for the salaries in

198
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,970
the agency's operating them you feel
their

199
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,510
what you feelin should be between what
should be

200
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:29,170
which would be legally heard by citizens
and

201
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,130
what you get private world the way used
my

202
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,579
radio gear after the September 11 fans
because

203
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:40,720
really freak me this thing drove me

204
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,940
slide oh my god you know

205
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,209
the world is not safe anymore and

206
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,940
whenever I heard a big bang or something
I just under my skin

207
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,579
listen to what's going on okay some car
crashed

208
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,709
trio that's all sold for me it is also a
tape backup

209
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,370
keeping close to come back what's going
on

210
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,810
and want it all and you can't receive it
anymore

211
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,180
I think will be a losing what's going on
around you

212
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,510
and personally I think that's really a
bad thing

213
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,050
of course I understand there's some
special ops that

214
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,510
people don't listen supposed to listen
to

215
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,930
because its technical information but
for

216
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,540
for the plainclothes police going to
rescue a cat that symmetry

217
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,730
I don't think that you okay

218
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,500
up obviously if you wanna listen to

219
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,620
something is on the year on the airwaves
you you know what frequencies on

220
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,220
and sometimes you can have an idea
generation Juve

221
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,959
frequencies you know the particular
mugging and tenor something you can tell

222
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,970
from the link to that its

223
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,449
rough way to Lincoln and get an idea for
what frequency band might be and if

224
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,029
you're looking for the exact frequency

225
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,459
wanna find it you can use a device
called the frequency counter

226
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:03,829
and we have one here think you go into
the studio

227
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:07,399
very the same model yeah I'd I didn't
dare to bring it with me

228
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,110
have problems with the pics in the
locked already so I left all my skin

229
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,800
years alone but I have this exact model

230
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,360
and have a special moment in my car I
just clip it in

231
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,399
and when I Drive through the city the
country

232
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,890
everything that surround me in a few
meters

233
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,079
I don't the art but anyway anything
that's that's

234
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,790
most people in line of sight in the
streets if something is communicating

235
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,620
most the time

236
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,120
the counter was just catch it grab it
and make a little alert

237
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,370
and though the frequency with the punch
it up into my scanner and listen to it

238
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:49,800
up here

239
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,850
here skaters says that

240
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,649
who make have a second later to

241
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:01,449
our skaters policy there problem
sometimes is that

242
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:05,260
exactly it says its on 170 .5

243
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,120
by 72 management 550 and you get a
little

244
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,959
spin around catching if you don't have
the cable

245
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,779
reaction June you get real fast in
typing even if you're driving high speed

246
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,370
getting some it's certainly having a
sick sense he

247
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,819
you can be walking around a driving
around and whenever the a

248
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:32,500
whenever the the frequency counter to
textarea frequency you can learn

249
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,269
we divide the poor vibrator the singer
wearing your you're sure

250
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,350
feel that there's some radio activity
going around you

251
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,209
and you can put that equity in your
scanner in here what's going on

252
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,800
I its particularly useful if you're
driving around

253
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,829
there's a no prisons a police car nearby

254
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:54,829
it will even if they're using encrypt
communications

255
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:58,180
long we'll hear them but you will detect
their presence

256
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,260
if they're on the radio this Sat this

257
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,158
counter right now is showing UHF
frequency

258
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,409
that was stored in earlier by I think

259
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:16,390
transmit hopefully the demonstration

260
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,860
that could be why a battery my

261
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:27,860
he went to show closed

262
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:39,168
captain

263
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,950
maybe in

264
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,300
okay can't

265
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,110
either its doing free-floating

266
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,850
make you push yes present is here

267
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,080
area this is stepping through

268
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,530
frequencies its log recently there's a
sailor frequency

269
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,309
another sailor frequency television
frequency another sailor frequency so

270
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:12,389
apparently the lotto sale if entry
operator uranium I understand that

271
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,180
you're not allowed to listen

272
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,450
I you're not allowed to in this country
but def it it's not illegal to

273
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,480
to know that the frequency is being used

274
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,230
around you so frequency counter can can
pick up the frequencies but it won't be

275
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,650
modulated much you hear them

276
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,770
up back in eighty six and

277
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,139
Congress passed a lot making it a crime
to listen to certain radio frequencies

278
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,350
kinda strange laws like now being look
at certain college

279
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,600
light or something on this post and free

280
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,059
I'm sorry the land of the free land of
the free

281
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,620
to those who have enough money to
persuade Congress to

282
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,990
get your your wishes but but a

283
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,940
I'm just teasing beginner you can
purchase radios that are capable uva

284
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,070
receiving a

285
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,178
frequencies and outside in

286
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,840
in the Forbidden range they can be
ordered like a model

287
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,860
version at this rate it can be a can be
ordered from

288
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,840
outside the US from Canada from UK from
finland

289
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,889
now and the Netherlands that's right I

290
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,150
for to some hundred dollars and it would
like you here

291
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,200
sale if it means however most alias now
is digital

292
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,660
and I got this error Sounders deal
noisier

293
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,300
nothing at all but according quite a few
quite a few were

294
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,470
phones will will fall of the digital
network because it is a member so poorly

295
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,130
designed

296
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,140
you Roman to an allotment and

297
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,050
than you you can listen to those cause
if you want but frankly pretty boring

298
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,399
and nighter not all that interesting as
interesting as a soap opera

299
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,860
and some of the scanner you can just
open it up

300
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,830
find the right jumpers or notes you can

301
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,850
you you can find two months on the net
he might have the case is very famous

302
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,450
for this

303

place where look isn't always collect
and I use it all the time

310
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,570
by radio most of the time there some
modification to

311
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,280
let it scan fast

312
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,820
do more channels things

313
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:36,820
your people ordering pizza ordering

314
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,380
card numbers the air as

315
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,510
Voice realize voicemail password says
everything exact this

316
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,879
is a transmitter as a radio address sell
for

317
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,320
they sell cellular radio

318
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,659
actually here

319
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,380
towered here no

320
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,480
the list whatever you want

321
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,890
there's actually a radio

322
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,110
3 wide

323
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:21,110
shows this

324
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,310
here

325
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:33,310
so there's no laws against that again as
Youkilis

326
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,080
okay mechanic okay well

327
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,010
you don't your how about listening to
these

328
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,290
portable telephones that people have in
the house

329
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,590
that was a that was cheered would change
little bit later it was

330
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,949
it was only listened cellular phones in
86

331
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,040
but then I think in ninety four another
law was passed making it legal to listen

332
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,370
to

333
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,080
cordless telephones can you have your
house but we're the patient with 92

334
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,889
to a regular ballots online it still
doesn't prevent people from

335
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,110
doing and it's not it's not illegal to
sell

336
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,730
in this country receivers like this
they're capable

337
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,750
receiving cordless telephones free love
them

338
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,790
older ones run the 46 to 49 makers range

339
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,080
and then there's the the newer part not
even knew them

340
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,500
cordless phones in the 900 megahertz
range from about 90 29 28 megahertz

341
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,000
and as the 2.4 gigahertz cordless phones
which are little more secure because

342
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,240
it's difficult to get receivers are as
expensive to get receivers it will tune

343
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,500
up to that high-frequency

344
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,650
but its quite possible on at the most
secure cordless phone you can get would

345
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,290
be one

346
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,670
is digital spread spectrum not just a
tool which

347
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,710
digital sprint spectrum we're signals
are spread over a wide range of

348
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,380
frequencies

349
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,940
and 2.4 gigahertz a sprint spectrum sale
the phone is a little more secure from

350
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,290
from casual eavesdropping then than all
the others however

351
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,379
you know if your adversaries someone
with means

352
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,810
on or legal power behind them

353
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,950
other not even try minor tear through
the air that's gonna

354
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,240
connect to the phone companies which
which is now

355
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,060
mandated under kaliya so on you know you
really have you're concerned private

356
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,800
concerns

357
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,520
you can't do anything about it the
government really machine uses in

358
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,590
in cricket phone conversations and
that's where possums to church 11 panel

359
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,439
came in yesterday

360
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,020
but a as far as cordless phone
conversations if you have an older

361
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,850
cordless phone

362
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,920
I it's not digital get rid of it

363
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,720
you're broadcasting conversation see the
entire neighborhood and

364
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,930
or if you want to take your handset
driver dryer on your car

365
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,620
and turn it on because by Ophelia turn
on somebody else's

366
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,130
receiver be there phone because there's
only 10 frequencies

367
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,500
used on the 47 years back in the air

368
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,130
yeah United States so this whole war
dialing thing going on with the EU

369
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:02,350
edited at 11 be broke all the year
earlier earlier cordless phones back and

370
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:02,960
I guess that

371
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,270
late 70's early 80's it was real popular
thing for kids right around the bicycles

372
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,770
where the cars I guess with the cordless
phone handset

373
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,930
and a snack downturns other people's a

374
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,930
cordless base units and it was very easy
to do I go around I

375
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,410
find a budget outlines make calls on the
phone line which

376
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,350
I tried the only time I tried it the the
guy picked up his

377
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,660
I so I had conversations that you know
that my son accidentally picked up your

378
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,810
dial sounds like so

379
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,070
turns out to I listen to the scanner

380
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,100
few minutes later heard in Hollister
erybody any complaints and taking this

381
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,460
thing

382
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,000
back to the store so a 11 trick I did a

383
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,330
on on a neighbor few years ago was a
overheard as partners phone

384
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,949
conversations performs a legal

385
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,950
had and he was talking to his mother i
think im trying to think of somewhere I

386
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,630
can remember

387
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,020
myself what it was but it's just trying
to think of some word and

388
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,280
he could think of it and I'm

389
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,290
I knew was agitated know is found in
with but I had a reverse directory

390
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,629
Charlotte up his phone number

391
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,770
and while he was on the phone I called
him a call waiting answer the fan

392
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,980
and all it is I said that word and he's
like I'll and he hung up

393
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,180
and then animals as long pause

394
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,230
and is like mom he just said

395
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,980
other or whatever the word wasn't and
then they just aren't happy conversation

396
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,620
like

397
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,120
has a possible what what was that so a

398
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,560
I mean I was trying to help a guy out
but a probably

399
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,020
probably gave him something to think
about for a while yet you're sitting in

400
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,580
your car

401
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,210
into some guys driveway and listen to
him ya going on the phone to iOS

402
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,780
is d whatever here's a

403
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,220
there's this guide into my driveway ices

404
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,670
drive away don't don't hang in CE

405
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,160
listen to him call the police on you
because just doctor

406
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,270
don't don't rail

407
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:06,100
course fish fish list doc steam decide
to

408
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,850
besides it's ever been just talking
about there's a there's other singles

409
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,650
out there they're

410
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,240
I'll higher frequency here zia

411
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,710
there's a device cutting have

412
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,280
special-purpose

413
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,670
here

414
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,910
this is an icon are three came out a
couple years ago

415
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,930
it's a handheld scanner but it also has
a video screen on

416
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:38,930
and to a TV station right now

417
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,669
but one of the things about this is this
goes up to that too

418
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,640
twenty-five hundred megahertz so prolly
bout

419
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,200
everybody who's been on the on been on
the web has had these damn pop-up ads

420
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,400
for extend a calmness or home

421
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,820
home video cameras how many how many
have seen the zapata as for x10

422
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,490
corporation Wow okay yeah they're quite
annoying I think they're

423
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,360
probably one of the biggest abusers in
this whole pop-up window advertising

424
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,600
methodology but anyway what their

425
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,080
with their products dealer would love
the product there was a transmit video

426
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,389
and audio over a wireless

427
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,720
connection radio connection it around
the 2.4 gigahertz band which is

428
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,480
unlicensed

429
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,870
as is its practicing roughly same
frequencies 802 9/ 11

430
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:29,100
the transceivers use so anyway the
intended to come to the are

431
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,790
are three really is not suitable for
this really high frequencies in fact

432
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,560
that works better with out that antenna

433
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,210
district it is but if you really want to
work find these things

434
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,590
this a isn't any here

435
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,740
you might have seen SM word were driving

436
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,820
Thai people use in this here's a and

437
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,139
2.4 gigahertz gain antenna

438
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,290
probably got nine or 10 dB gain which is
quite a bit

439
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,820
and highly directional so you can a

440
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,919
you drive around a walk down the street
in a want this thing it different houses

441
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,350
and see if there's any wireless video
equipment operating in their home

442
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,410
and you can actually see on the screen I
A twice I've been able to

443
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,490
to my neighbors cameras I

444
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,760
on in their home you can see what's
going on in their home because they have

445
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,080
it set up a one person has said it was
just defeat the

446
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,470
video from from a a VCR to another room
said

447
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,320
I could watches movies and the other
person had it said set up in there

448
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,760
at the front door actually stairwell
going up to their

449
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,840
Martin so I could see when someone was
coming going so it says this this

450
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,030
extends stuff is a

451
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,760
hardly secure basically what you're
buying one of these cams mixed n

452
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,680
you're setting up a militia TV station
broadcasting what's going on

453
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,890
in your home or wherever to to your
neighbors and if they have the equipment

454
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,110
to do that they can

455
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,850
they can watch what you doing in a you
you might want to be selective about

456
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,200
where you put one of these things

457
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,870
sales people realize how far some the
signals travel as well

458
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,420
for example the call Corliss telephones

459
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,220
on telephones the broadcaster half-mile
circle around your house

460
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,220
driving around within half a mile

461
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,500
hear somebody you know they're within
with it

462
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,580
well sir the countryside for we're
definitely getting into

463
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,080
berries area expertise which is the
microwave frequencies

464
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,020
so well in in Europe I can touch in with
with being used here in this country

465
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,600
better

466
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,810
in Europe whatcha these frequencies
above us above 700 megahertz being used

467
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,100
for

468
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,830
this 2.4 is really want the most
interesting

469
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,909
bans especially for while driving

470
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,970
with 211 in

471
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,540
freezes in the Netherlands prostitution
is legal so we have red light district

472
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,659
and

473
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,450
they're pretty phone securing their
places

474
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,520
with these wireless cameras if you are
driving around the red light district

475
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,070
is like having a XXX rated radio

476
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,629
re speak next time I go there very out
to bring my aren't really

477
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,880
but was almost more exciting than

478
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,540
the red light district is that the
police helicopters

479
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,800
in the Netherlands used the same
frequencies about

480
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,740
for for putting up on the the helicopter
images

481
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,270
when this right and stuff and you can
see firsthand

482
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,850
people throwing bricks at the cops this

483
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,060
and there's a guy named Schelling and

484
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,639
you recorded all these defense with this

485
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,790
yup and which

486
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,290
online how would I would be fine
tractors and I'd like to

487
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,760
I'd like to watch when there's and
nowadays I think he did it for like a

488
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,140
small

489
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,500
year was recording all these things and
putting them online

490
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,330
with funny picked and now they're just
trying to scramble

491
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,020
most things especially when SWAT teams
are involved

492
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,889
and kidnap situation real heavy stuff

493
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,820
scrambled immediately sometimes it's
still unclear

494
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,840
and you can see pretty interesting
things it's a it's done in this country

495
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,460
chile just so happens that

496
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,690
the icon 13 which really only hand-held

497
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,430
scanner dated she defines media on

498
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,790
it was designed to not white girl into

499
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,700
goes up to about 2.45 gigahertz

500
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,920
I to very just slightly above that not
much it on the

501
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,370
no no problem designed to cover the
higher I

502
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,230
are wireless video transmitters made by
a company called

503
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,880
adid audio intelligence devices which is
a division westinghouse which sells a

504
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,790
lot of electronic surveillance equipment
to

505
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,590
federal and state law enforcement
agencies Anderson surprising amount of

506
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,320
the

507
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,740
video unattended video surveillance
equipment

508
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,150
RAM you see cameras around but I'm done
talking about those in talking about

509
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,590
covert cameras that are hidden

510
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,050
in electrical power transformers on
utility poles

511
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:08,490
he telephone junction boxes along front
lines on telephone poles

512
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,530
or yeah so-called pedestal screen

513
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,910
reno things to seek out the ground about
three feet phone lines are in

514
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,170
take concealed wireless video camera net

515
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,460
I've noticed in philadelphia Ryland

516
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,470
I've got a great view from my office
other the rooftop

517
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,940
the Federal Building in six Market
Street and there's

518
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,430
there's two Mike with antennas on that
roof which are

519
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,190
not sadly engines they are pointed
downward

520
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,640
and every year every couple days their
move to a different position

521
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,540
and I look at things with these things
with binoculars and contacted friend on

522
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,870
the west coast easy sell

523
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,620
Angela force in agencies and he sent me
a a

524
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,410
catalog and describe the company that
makes makes these things and sure enough

525
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,010
and a catalog with these exact same
tennis team stylings

526
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,280
it was it was this company's product so
basically I

527
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,370
from looking at these antennas I could
get a general idea who were

528
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,340
who the Fed Philadelphia were looking at
in which direction I'm looking

529
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,160
with looking Northeast Philadelphia
South Philadelphia that sort of thing

530
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,470
and pretty intriguing I haven't yet

531
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:19,120
gotten around to getting in line of
sight between one of these intends and

532
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,300
worms pointed

533
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,630
to work to capture the stuff to I have
either committed

534
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,580
wouldn't do that here's a is peaceful
coming here spectrum analyzer that would

535
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,270
actually let you see

536
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,660
fortunately I haven't a camera we can
zoom in on

537
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:39,660
in two min much on was at

538
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,960
okay and I think we can get around for
this thing is really

539
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,780
anyway with what a spectrum analyzer
Liesel issues

540
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,500
CC bites see spikes in the electric

541
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,620
magnetic spectrum that would indicate a
presence in the signal

542
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,720
and can look at a ranger frequencies and
see a

543
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,380
see were bombs despite signs inspector
this equipment is also used

544
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,629
by people sweeping your office for

545
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:14,359
transmitters in box this equipment

546
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:21,359
being used

547
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:33,370
it raises are shown up

548
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,230
granite is upside down GT ET's bikes
coming from the bottom

549
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,950
but their representative signals on the
spectrum the range on

550
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:25,950
on the LCD display what frequency range
you looking at

551
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,800
we could find them

552
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,640
this is around 665 666 which we're
trying to find you

553
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,109
difficulty the the wireless microphones
were using here now

554
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,080
explode

555
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:19,080
if all goes well 641 until June

556
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:40,450
we operated

557
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:54,670
this

558
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,330
well anyway

559
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:59,710
you get the gist up you see the spikes

560
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,890
something sweet near officer but
somebody s your buds

561
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,100
wireless transmission %ah there could be

562
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,360
I just frankly Cesar sees itself and now
amateur bugging

563
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:17,360
yourself on

564
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,779
it's pretty hard to to find a buyer
these days are so many technologies that

565
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,369
make it and make it difficult there's

566
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:31,800
spread spectrum there's a there's a
subcarriers that sorta thing

567
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,400
unless you have a something like this
and a lot of patience

568
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,290
it's difficult to find hidden
transmitter

569
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:46,290
this hidden by professional

570
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,960
okay you and she now here is bytes

571
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,960
and I'll turn wireless mic these

572
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:14,029
chic

573
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,849
to as a radio signal looks like once you
do find out what it looks like you can

574
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:22,410
either listen to her play with it such
as

575
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,670
trans air links quickly over this

576
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,869
here girls are gonna touch if you're
debugging a room you want to

577
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,219
with the if you if the room is down
clean you would like if you had when he

578
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:33,150
sings the

579
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,920
in a weekly or monthly basis he would do
a sweep like this and take

580
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,069
alright fotografia digital storage
spectrum analyzer

581
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:43,430
store these traces and then compare them
in the future without a trace

582
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,899
see if anything new not done on and
decide on you

583
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,099
and used bike that was in there last
week and you knew you could have

584
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,890
important meeting this week

585
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,430
you would investigate what is this by
work now this is something

586
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,118
should be there it's also common
knowledge when you do

587
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,690
bucks wheaties you go like two miles
from the place where you have to sweep

588
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,479
you make an image what the spectrum
looks like expect you can expect and

589
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,489
when you're at the scene

590
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:14,099
actually have to sweep you already know
a lot of things that you can just cancel

591
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,579
yet it's gonna be a lot a legitimate
spikes in a local radio stations to a

592
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:18,640
radio user's

593
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,368
all kinda stuff like that so you gotta
be able to filter the year

594
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:25,430
just visually the old Italian

595
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,969
which should be there should be there so
having a record what was there before

596
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:32,809
comparing it with their noses we do it
all

597
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:36,199
wanna somebody a here at the

598
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,199
the conference here today let me this

599
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,579
this device which is a a

600
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:46,799
a cell phone jammer they're not legal in
this country edit ordered from the UK

601
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:51,309
shipped here letter I was kinda
skeptical about this I thought it was

602
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:54,739
it's so lightweight I thought this is
just a piece of paper where and

603
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:58,089
to get market looks surprisingly
sophisticated inside put it on the

604
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:03,170
spectrum analyzer have time to set up
now but I its for about a hundred

605
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:03,869
megahertz

606
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:09,849
okay stern's thing this thing

607
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:13,630
worked it actually a jammed wide noise
generator

608
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,650
people are on the phone now say by

609
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,059
yes I sware

610
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:28,059
you see that wide range that's a whole

611
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,379
that's a whole like 20 megahertz bread
love

612
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,789
RF he sings are legally just cause
interference headaches

613
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:38,640
some restaurants churches are

614
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,940
but these things ended preventer
people's phones ringing restaurant

615
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,309
disturbing other people or

616
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:50,309
if you were to now

617
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,240
this a transmission to the NZ 100
megahertz cell phone band and the 1900

618
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,220
making herself and down in the circuit
races on here were the European version

619
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,160
if they had different components on it
would do the

620
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,660
the European self and frequencies as
well 900 and 1800 right so %uh this is

621
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,560
an intriguing device in after taking
apart ensure their class and

622
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,759
and I looked at it and we rather press
for something was

623
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,660
hundred dollars or something it really
worked up royally gives you may be 104

624
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,120
range

625
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,120
a blocking fans but to

626
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,970
these things can be really dangerous
there's somebody set one up outside your

627
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,550
house and

628
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:37,550
emergency yourself and yeah I could be a
problem

629
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:44,990
few hundred feet

630
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,830
okay

631
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,880
yes he was he was very good Jennifer
Lopez movie which is some

632
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,090

635
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,619
trying to sell them she was stalking him

636
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:10,290
she had this gem you could make the call
he killed them

637
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,340
but skilled but analysts to the movie
but anyway

638
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,650
she is when he sings in the movie

639
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:21,490
on I think Craig wanted to mention a
couple of other interesting

640
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,480
certain packing opportunities for
summary for equities

641
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,630
things rigid transmitter links

642
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,210
Austria stations the transmitter

643
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,910

644
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,529

area studio transfer lease operating 930
makers area

647
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,180
and their white band them so which is

648
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,250
fun to play with because you know their
frequency

649
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,350
and we can take your nap station is by
be

650
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,950
stronger receive signal their

651
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,390
at their studio there

652
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,089
the actual transmitter site said they
have 45 miles away

653
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,420
there serio transmitter link transmitter
which is 10 whites

654
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,810
you are less than a mile away from their

655
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:26,790
actual transmitter site you have a happy
water transmission transmitter on that

656
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,740
same frequency

657
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:33,300
you'll be able to take over that radio
station they'll settle

658
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,480
linebacker I don't play road lies things

659
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,060
so it if you do want to take over at
Station

660
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,700
you know the yeah I known frequency the
studio transfer Lee frequency

661
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,460
have a transfer operate side
recrystallized cellular telephone

662
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:53,600
bag phone player there or Beijing
transmitter once you take them over they

663
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,380
have no control over the transmitter

664
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,530
0 like it trays their control tracks

665
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,390
control signals girls City studio so you
know it take

666
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,460
have them get back control their own
transmitters

667
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,550
you turn it up for this and tech
interest

668
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:13,380
for my situation stationers work exit 45
miles away

669
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,780
at the transmitter for quite some time
so what you do actually

670
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,030
take it over at that point you can
forget about LP a

671
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:25,340
HPM you're in charge a control 50,000

672
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,750

00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,520
satellites to not actually

675
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,660
giving up your own satellite also
transit on the same

676
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,259
exist satellite downlink frequency is
really close the receiver

677
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,340
this works really fun wal-mart's take
over the entire Walmart radio network

678
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,580
other have late special I'll 7

681
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,990
LED signs you see around storefronts for
their

682
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,250
often easily compromised with

683
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,180
device like this for the biggest
manufacture these signs is a company

684
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,859
called

685

adaptive Microsystems and

686
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,170
this is an control that is used to to
program them remotely

687
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:22,109
through infrared like a TV remote
control but its pricing on me

688
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:25,759

as the she was even there anymore she
just absolutely undertake

700
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,369
have on and user

701
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:07,810
there's a GPS unit probably a lot of
people are familiar with that uses

702
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:12,600
signals broadcast by US government
military satellites in

703
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,370
give you a position where you are you
have to worry about these things be

704
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,490
privacy invasion the

00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,120
transmitting themselves you can be
tracked with his innocence

706
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,190
something like this in yourself and
which is be mandated now

707
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,410
but if you just have a GPS unit you can
be fun

708
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:32,210
one other need developments i've seen
with GPS easily something called geo

709
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:32,820
caching

710
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,960
and you cash in San something where

711
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,980
you can you can hide objects in

712
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,230
in a container tupperware when this is
military

713

CA CH ING dot com and

717
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,700
find out where these things are you this
thousand caches around the country's

718
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,220
a hobby you hunt these things down your
GPS unit

719
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,690
and when you when you encounter one

720
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,200

happening for

730
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,290
so that if you have a GPS unit you

I didn't like it the way

737
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:26,689
