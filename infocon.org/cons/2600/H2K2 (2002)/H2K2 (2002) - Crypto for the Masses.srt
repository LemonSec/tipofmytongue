00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,350
welcome to the condo for the masses
panel

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,320
money that I saw mom with me I have a
fav

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,880
because don's my plays but maybe

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,529
and on contrary to my position up here I
am

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,659
not going to try to be the moderator I
want this to be a fairly equal her

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,280
position amongst us on the most in the
audience as well

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,520
on I will do it so to interrupt us on

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,620
if you are looking be part of the ER
discussion at any point om

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,820
crypto for the masses prodotto wasn't
really a bid for the masses

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,979
more than about ten years ago its being
used by military is for thousands of

12
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:52,760
years but

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,000
until arm around the time with PGP
people

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,170
didn't really think about using
photography to protect their

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,089
communications

16
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,479
or issue arm bridge other conserve our

17
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,000
social schemes that we thought it take
for granted in reality into information

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,700
space

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,540
those social schemes being things like
the concept of personal identity which

20
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,049
is that

21
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:16,229
I love you in the face I know who you
are on the ISOC some degree of

22
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,530
up trust with your other attributes
concepts like being able to tell

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,700
a secret or are tell you something
privately

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,870
concerts like that and on a million on

25
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,540
those are all things that have leading
information space over the past 10 years

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
because I love

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,310
PGDM other technologies but also things
that happen to become

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,620
arm having come into the wide use that
some people expected them to be there

29
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,040
was

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,170
a great little safer parts for for a
long time which is love comes to an end

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,950
partially because I love not a a total
failure to you

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,130
arm make a part of the widespread among

33
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,199
ordinary people but it I wouldn't even
say that

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,870
may be fewer than one percent over
internet users are on

35
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,170
actively using photography to protect
their privacy

36
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,780
from Flickr shook hands with people who
who use a program like pgp at least once

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,440
in the past

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,159
as a lot of people it's all the people
in New York

39
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,010
here him and go to go shopping at the
holy people are

40
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,120
are still using it today and we kinda
regular basis 3

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,810
hero are looking at I think about
three-quarters the first time would be a

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,730
good one who decides

43
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,170
time net St on so let me just not the
question

44
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,920
why is that there are no obviously

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,389
use issues and there's the issue that
any security does not transparent

46
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,400
doesn't take used

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,170
but on body and you folks up to but to
say about those pipes and look for a job

48
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,099
with Microsoft hahaha last

49
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,599
with people all using fashion when

50
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,969
just operates and we're lives are

51
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,888
%um tax setting up

52
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:06,790
your mail lines choice someone's

53
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,569
something site had stuff like this

54
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,989
a lot is

55
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,360
work hard outlook or are of

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,540
this week

57
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,109
but United it is possible

58
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,340
all month runs would

59
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,430
on strong crypto after a while

60
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,850
hand you know that was are small

61
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,269
a yahan on problem

62
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,940
solo note that this is largely a result
does not exist

63
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,190
problem people's feelings a credit card
numbers over the water and

64
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,260
somehow there was this arm a

65
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,549
media hi about what are what a horrible

66
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,850
crisis otherwise about people stealing
credit card numbers by tapping

67
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,760
internet connections far as I know in a
to a first approximation has never

68
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,340
happened are

69
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,489
but up people were people perceive this
was

70
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:12,250
a a serious threat this was this was
something to really worry about

71
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,580
and your consumers demanded on

72
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,950
that they are that if they were gone
when gauging any

73
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,370
find 0 electronic commerce Mac any by

74
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,900
overall over the web %uh

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,430
baby day one encryption throne of God
protrude

76
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,320
was kinda silly motivation for but

77
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,800
are you know it didn't show that France
crypto

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,050
it was certainly feasible to do with
this demand for new responsible for

79
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,290
implementing resolutions of

80
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,910
much well he did you see a tussle
mock-up

81
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,560
that that's been recover files world

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,419
for for you know what are the important

83
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,469
questions to casket what you know what's

84
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,520
what's the threat were you trying to we
from

85
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,740
fact arm and you know it's very easy to
just way

86
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,030
for there was some matter pixie dust
that from

87
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,460
text you from no and things happen
thinking

88
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,680
throughput exactly this information from
there

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,770
were what's the threat like house I'll

90
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,419
are you know it its these looking
Wednesday

91
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,909
he's a handsome probably asked the wrong
question

92
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,520
or at least you didn't ask a large
enough actually I'm

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,490
whatever I will not lose focus on small
with his followers

94
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,720
it's a nice on the disciples

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,250
dropped the ball in his specifically

96
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,470
PG he is it's a

97
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,580
activism where original location balls

98
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,080
both parties going on exchange keys this

99
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,599
secure transaction well it's a it's a
manual process

100
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,719
do trees secure personal

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,740
your with PGP

102
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,680
certainly on and I this is a completely
insane

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,810
approached security it's far too much
security for what we actually need to

104
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,289
get a little

105
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:21,229
policy I you can see why this doesn't
have a chance in hell

106
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,289
working the thing about me is law

107
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:29,830
please lost value on their the group the
number of groups oh yeah

108
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,359
is as a is that the best definition how
much value to generate

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,390
from our communications medium on and
his laws also the best description

110
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,650
other number of key exchanges are going
to happen given

111
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,700
pgp so

112
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,120
can see that thought the same value from
reads law also case

113
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,530
in say an hour work from PGP key
exchanges are

114
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,479
with assault weapons over define slap to
the

115
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,560
some response and under under defined
the threat to be

116
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,580
a and the truth right as the invite
surpassing

117
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,190
the clearness the park and what we need
is no

118
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,789
24 percent better security I was not a
nice person

119
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,590
security on the scene know those

120
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,610
PGDM I technologies being an overkill
bomb

121
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,830
opening on this is welch's on that

122
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,969
could possibly can be over 200 imposible

123
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,050
let me give an example I've wants you
well

124
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,409
send a message to somebody and prove
that message

125
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,320
is from me my personal identity as a

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Obama privately on in really well I'll
tell you something secretly I was pretty

127
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,719
sure you want to prove identity you

128
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:49,229
you look me in the face in you are you
know try to determine whether love

129
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,349
astronaut arm

130
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:56,890
on the internet when I are signs of my
public key and it's a fairly strong hold

131
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,680
him to give it he was fully clothed

132
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,169
Nura affidavit and I mean I want to

133
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,430
say something to you in such a way that
you can then go around & Sons has proved

134
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,529
to the whole world that I said such and
such a thing on such-and-such a day

135
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,110
and so on the the particular

136
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,550
cryptographic schemes that have been
chosen for for implementing

137
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,339
6.0 personal identity on the Internet

138
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:26,580
our own the don't match those teams with
a working we are very well

139
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,468
and on this carries or some other things
as well including that

140
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,490
if people talk about these hierarchies
trusting that trust is our

141
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,640
trust a Yorkie is like any kind of human
fast as we know it yet

142
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,870
people often confuse it and Dom Dr

143
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,480
one thing that I i would like to say is
that

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,480
the whole carry-over and on a mini are
the genetic information space has been

145
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,589
fairly successful on his honor utilizes
the whole thing that can be very

146
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:58,360
transparent

147
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,250
on it works very well and on

148
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,210
possibly argue that it's it's not a
right are have a problem with that

149
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,190
I with them that's the thing I'm most
excited about

150
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,080
right now I think most of the problems
both crypto for secrecy in go for

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,060
authentication

152
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,070
outsider we trust model problems are
largely

153
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,589
solved you know to matter point with it
on

154
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,350
the interesting open problems

155
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,310
I think our for school trust model
problems and second of all

156
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,720
the home how do you 100 height

157
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,510
information that encryption itself
doesn't rental

158
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,600
tactics like routed network seems like

159
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,180
muscles and isn't much easy

160
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,360
is for poverty to help you a little bit
with that arms

161
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,680
were but you also need other mechanisms
meant snapple's

162
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,430
on grounds like that and though you know
we

163
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,649
we know a little bit about how to
construct networks like that but we

164
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:02,450
don't know how to scale not our

165
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,839
practical effects on the heart is just
enormous sum

166
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,839
amount both I'll work to be done

167
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,370
arm yeah by people who are interested

168
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,160
eating arm pushing the bounds of things

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,790
and in the interesting thing is all
these anonymity networks require

170
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,420
infrastructure so from it they need

171
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,420
people providing relays on networks and

172
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,390
and services like that this is really
something that

173
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,870
that the hacker community is is right

174
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,709
to be very much involved with and

175
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:41,279
potential have a impact on on the way
our hearts to silence

176
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,980
one last thing I'm most excited about
these days

177
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,430
I think we're clearly losing the
anonymity struggle at this point in the

178
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,610
day

179
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,140
talk with saddam wonderful wonderful
stays at the same time

180
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,020
the I'm that this the successes that
hackers have been the

181
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,290
in the last mile is best for small for
example

182
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,469
most the posse give up his annual your
IP address this issue

183
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,240
with are login to web sites from a
browser

184
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,080
trivial things like that get the name of
your your browser manufacture

185
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,480
on and site for parts and

186
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,410
was initially successful with things
like its debts which are you know one

187
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,000
things

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,260
well fortunately because I problem and
nobody's really a

189
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,120
coalition race between individuals
receiving privacy

190
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,440
and of people who won compromise

191
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,459
the privacy a popper successes have been

192
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,790
targeted at a adaptations from the
opposite side

193
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,689
they haven't called yet soluble nobody's
looking tracing of P traffic

194
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,839
at a low of the talking about which is

195
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,120
absent is not a little people doing
extraordinary well

196
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,569
by tracing your IP address browser
combination

197
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:06,378
a on I know this I work for II popping
optimized

198
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:10,670
bad on according to you what we knew
about

199
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,660
a

200
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,110
the bizarre on based on what we could
have $0.00

201
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,510
well as your operating system all the
geographic location for IP addresses or

202
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,900
I can tell you when you have a lot of
people we could

203
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,830
increase we can but it will be windy as
we know a lot about you is these trivial

204
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,020
trespasses its and so the

205
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,210
so it's it's a coevolutionary s

206
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,190
Bangalore said we need to make sure
distances

207
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,690
are defenses for the actual threats as
opposed to you

208
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,940
must educate well yeah book but that's
the the

209
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,370
the time to enter the technology to mom

210
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,840
addressed for a is not while you're
under attack

211
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,380
so about that there isn't widespread

212
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,290
arm tracing and IP addresses or

213
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,829
little dossiers the user

214
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,630
me right now yeah either either
governments about private sector at the

215
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,250
moment

216
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,790
on doesn't leave the better
infrastructure is very weak against

217
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,650
flops a little

218
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,110
for up for a artisan

219
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,260
potentially a big problem are so I think

220
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,340
you know I think I think it is very
important particularly for this

221
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,780
community people concerned about privacy
generally think about

222
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,939
sales and would like to lay the
groundwork to

223
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,630
at the tailgate society logging on these
lifestyles

224
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,380
sam lebudde we had we want to take an
example of

225
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,110
John my babies PDP thing

226
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,220
wells s here right the differences

227
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,440
we on problem with any is

228
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,430
your acting monthly wanna very small
number of you of

229
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,690
maas on sounds

230
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,140
for handy to work beyond technical re

231
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,430
we have a lot of no was are a lucky he
is

232
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,560
easy these like reading long extremely
extremely gay

233
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,950
you know im very berlin's rooms from 101

234
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,270
from the website design this arm

235
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,990
no trouble same is actually working

236
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,060
months my colleague look Lori

237
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,180
same this group slogan privacy laws
company

238
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,440
and minutes networks

239
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,970
in really don't wanna be alone many
other people

240
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,950
like this wrote that story

241
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,650
but 1994 leaders eight years ago now

242
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,150
are we that I was at the first book
clockers we did provoking

243
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,410
arm this is this is complete a song

244
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,459
your we did a prepared and money

245
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,220
that he might from these be for reasons
I'll never quite been able to figure out

246
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,350
those late at night presumably
comparable or

247
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,490
both was in the audience a reporter from
are

248
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,990
a Wired Magazine I think the school in
both

249
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,730
Huang started on just mercilessly

250
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,010
helpful Spurs screaming where's the
crock rip mama

251
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,110
ever past proper speed aren't where's
the crime

252
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,870
and just screenie with even with the
microphones much lower than I was

253
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,840
is is this person in the room by NHS a

254
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,530
100 his I in think the end and never got
a chance for sanctions

255
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,079
season i've been waiting a year is to be
honest

256
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,310
the %uh and I've been thinking for the
last eight years that

257
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,590
does must be some levy work toward

258
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,380
that if I could come up with was shot in
my top and I still have thought so

259
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,640
this guy's not in the room at the moment
is is a big relief

260
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,970
in your its act

261
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:02,819
crimes

262
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,610
so the segue from from photography as a
threat

263
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,769
from needs to be addressed law
enforcement

264
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,019
certainly you poverty is a threat for
some fun

265
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,079
on the hope for vs over the last two
that was a number of years ago

266
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,730
though its news today

267
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,459
in on in many different ways one of
which is

268
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:31,379
I'm with also about a permission that he
GPS of monthly visits to this point on

269
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,449
the PDP

270
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,329
I think your two ago really did have a a
terrible vulnerability to smother

271
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,699
in the future following additional
efficiencies and on

272
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,949
it's been argued a little bit you know
inclusively

273
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:49,189
arm as to whether that was an
intentional sort of taint or whether it

274
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,449
really just wasn't oversight

275
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:53,680
but if you examine the structure 0

276
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,399
on corporations that was the party this
is what it is today

277
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,709
weather is no associates or whether it's
for the AG which is a

278
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:04,689
well yes no or silent for network
associates or whoever

279
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,939
on their side is a versatile in

280
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,720
family accompanies on and they all have
our

281
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,470
on the traces back to you are are the
NSA

282
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,569
and the other transit agencies that are

283
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,829
big questions are probably as Salaam

284
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,010
want to talk about is is that heating up
the polity

285
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,250
and down in the puzzle

286
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,970
for you know haha sry posse

287
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,090
owns college really anything else

288
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,549
settles arkansas are hands-on

289
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,299
com of continuing a big deal been too
slow

290
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,090
okay I think the content mom

291
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,289
people his Hong first

292
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:55,210
France's the anderson's problems

293
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,090
popped on of sunset these

294
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,230
is that he's a big news ours that is

295
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,950
tasaday of so we have

296
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,010
of available crypto

297
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,340
we have the mom

298
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,860
GPG which is open source mom

299
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,289
so that's good mom world haha

300
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,830
problems are

301
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,428
and we don't have much else right

302
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:30,750
jostling he's mom

303
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,620
increase haha arms I want to mention
that

304
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,710
related me

305
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,040
11 hassles

306
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,200
law are actions Facebook

307
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,740
Marjorie Charles shock haha of

308
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,740
me back to you if you can are read

309
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,020
see maas are in the end the series laws
he mentions

310
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,860
securely the ask is a fiasco

311
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,020
mop mal busy signs three drugs and other
songs

312
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,510
you have secure sites frames and secure
sites

313
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,070
in other words you listens to example
exactly what

314
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,689
should be impossible exactly what loans

315
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,600
salts of I think there's some

316
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,800
this is a problem and

317
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,909
people organizations telling us about
used in stock

318
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,420
are that's the highest

319
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,440
while employers low I'll

320
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,510
yeah I think a lot of this

321
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,170
part 03 for though include vendors

322
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,320
is I'll provoking specials

323
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,419
now as for though becomes a mass-market

324
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,820
them conceded were I'm hospital

325
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,120
microsoft office standard home you're
still depending on the security

326
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,520
things like your operating system you
know any other

327
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,040
software that has access to the betsy
one perfect but

328
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,409
um you know it its its K easy to focus
on things like the

329
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,650
is there a flaw in Pvt was has those
pieces of urban

330
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,030
been subverted are who the real problem
is

331
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,410
that proposal specialized the the wrong
is the product of their

332
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,300
arm you know thats the wrong with that
solves not

333
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,409
just figuring out whether or not arm

334
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,150
a particular is a software has
weaknesses but also

335
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,230
you note that the it is lightly widely
deployed model-driven

336
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,900
it okay why we love you as well I think
it's incumbent on the hackers who needs

337
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,580
to do more

338
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,820
the kind of our arm reviewer source code
and

339
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,179
when it's a black box for the follow
blockbuster view just dial

340
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,780
am relieved it doesn't expect and on
love giving us a a level of assurance on

341
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,190
officials in these parts that you can
actually trust

342
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,310
mark Harper problem months

343
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,790
and most polished want working has a
one-semester

344
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,600
wars harm forceful young

345
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,500
once still the people I can do

346
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,630
program are there of my hacks haha

347
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:16,630
nice song you propose a lot of fun

348
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,660
massive propose bomb arm you know so it
you know that attracts

349
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,040
0 a lot of lot of people has these nice
properties that the

350
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,110
other things are obviously impossible
but it turns out

351
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,530
deal things that are obviously on

352
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,810
their use either be really hard on so
you know they've

353
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,800
Matt reciprocal software export
superpower

354
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,800
are are also a lot of fun or interesting

355
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,490
the lab occasions you

356
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,800
surprising things want to separate out

357
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,530
from message security for media security
and

358
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,580
media is intrinsically secure are

359
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,980
that size the problem dot is that the
people who know how to

360
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,710
on bill secure applications of the most
boring

361
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,090
Brook Road which then runs on Windows
right

362
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,600
you know that the software the Purple
Heart

363
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,700
this offer might be completely
bulletproof but if

364
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,520
you know running on I love the are the
box Windows machine

365
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,879
what's the point okay with that

366
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,790
propose not the same security guards TV
to focus our attention

367
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,970
unevenly on

368
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,000
critter is on the day

369
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,950
could as a more interesting subject just
are

370
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,360
the Mexico by THQ bites

371
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,980
real estate on and

372
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,260
I think there's no engines with
progressing slowly

373
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,260
on this is a genuine heart so problems
so that

374
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,429
this this few guys

375
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:59,600
you know how much you in-laws this

376
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,010
problem find particularly interesting
Clausura

377
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,890
are owners lost before on israel's

378
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,360
so immersed in in the process that it's
hard to see the world

379
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,220
problems so the foreseeable that the

380
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,660
biggest successes of but you know

381
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,230
on hand arm it

382
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,570
Jol your information gay on

383
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,490
so for example arm its

384
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,390
less interested in me as singers in my
privacy keno

385
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,960
like 830 my bites on has to know

386
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,179
that's on like an obscure grass

387
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:45,560
leading to me in context you hire

388
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,450
on and that's a big success in terms of

389
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,140
of the Parthians it's a more doable I'll

390
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,040
on 30 I'm surely can't force anybody

391
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,120
think point to me that I wanna I don't
like cake that provides

392
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,510
way to get rid of them i cant it's very
hard to maintain the

393
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,110
them a lot of that it's useful

394
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,840
on yes same time for sure loss that
there is enough information attached to

395
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,580
it lately

396
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,360
back on so that's a that's a genuine
heart problem

397
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,179
Patel we handed that you can I'll 30
what's your graph cell

398
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:28,340
examples I'm getting at haha their own
today on on

399
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,678
gonna try push the far left at the
ballpark it's as far as I can take it

400
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,410
on and I don't want to attach to my was
a

401
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:40,500
for obvious reasons on I'm not
personally saying that

402
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,520
but was on the job you I love you buddy.
thinking about

403
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,129
my special streaming political history
and stuff like that so i likey

404
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,600
along us and so on to the simple stuff
using a pseudonym

405
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,370
are and process seems to say

406
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:58,110
graphing back to me following this link
back to me

407
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,660
it's a Google on is unlikely to her

408
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,900
so just saw this I'll

409
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,290
on yes by inserting the tolls

410
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,159
Journal point is that I its it's a
little too hard

411
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,280
do this stuff for a few d fashions I'll

412
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,730
on the part of Network Associates on
three leaky

413
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,290
on it's progressing slowly it's really
hard

414
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,960
in capability security just got here you
know the past couple years

415
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,530
its I was a huge to logistics long is
brand spanking new

416
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:38,760
so on the part of government being

417
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,330
are free to encryption mom

418
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,060
letter present one idea that I have
about 12 G

419
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,270
good for government and good for law
enforcement on

420
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:53,090
this additional thinking obviously has
been that if you are home

421
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,380
well only thing is that even further
from that and I just offer something

422
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,350
about the way

423
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,220
law enforcement or views the Internet
which is

424
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,290
that unlike arm the

425
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,659
the real world you don't have to

426
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,400
physically trouble to see what's going
on on the computer network

427
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,429
you don't have to go through a lot of
the the same hun so mom

428
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,480
affairs it's more like Justin
information call you can tap into in

429
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,420
this is obviously been very tough day

430
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,110
for law enforcement from as people 11
Mar the personal information

431
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,000
to the internet or other networks as
people alive more on these numbers for

432
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,280
their communications

433
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,350
it becomes more and more tempting me dnt
just Rd it just a dollar and this is

434
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,550
what things look as a lot easier for

435
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,750
was the problem know about that on

436
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,550
and this is really a natural thing

437
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,669
for such a

438
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,950
right approach to be used on are

439
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,290
on such a abrazarte communications and

440
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,409
but I'd like to say is that the more
people who

441
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,300
including communications arm the more it
is going to

442
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,800
hope law enforcement to do their job
properly about probably

443
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,460
I mean that choreography inclusion

444
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,100
a personal communications arm proposed
law enforcement from

445
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,580
are just sort of go to this link
communications firm

446
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,610
from to easily abusing their powers and

447
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,080
it really doesn't take away as much
power from law enforcement as they like

448
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,050
us to believe that led us to believe
that

449
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,678
something forget that fun at the end of
and really the fact is that you get so

450
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,610
long to somebody's house

451
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,679
arm and I am glad keyboards never leave
this open to cameras somebody's mother

452
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:40,780
in this happens all the time

453
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,620
on all information is really doing is
forcing law enforcement to go that one

454
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,830
additional stuff

455
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,790
to snooping on you a keeps them from
having just this I love

456
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,629
this training pop information where
everything is available to them

457
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,110
and on so I would live

458
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,250
everybody other think about this the
more important to think about it. that

459
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,690
arm clergy his is

460
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,270
a hurdle that home really makes

461
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,620
the information space a lot more like
the real world hun so

462
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,220
police power in terms of people's
privacy in terms of course you are

463
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,760
conduct themselves are in a private
matter and energy closer everyday

464
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,740
secrets

465
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,970
secret that you and I do all the time
but

466
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,520
another them think what would leave now
stated

467
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,179
me well even mainstream you know eight
years ago

468
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,900
we have a spam we have the chance well
home

469
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,720
that would have been you know %uh
radical but I think that

470
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,770
you as has finally made it into the

471
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,429
the mainstream you know the your first
the obvious

472
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:51,169
from thing which is that papa's these
primary purpose is to prevent crime

473
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:55,550
it it's too keep on authorized access to
information from

474
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,950
happen for schools and that a law
enforcement goal

475
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,159
and national security old you arm

476
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,300
for a while the hard to the government
that

477
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,560
I am law enforcement that are so
unfortunately threat

478
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,678
wholehearted disproportion Voice are

479
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,260
and also you know tended to what the
status quo thinking

480
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,520
designer thing deal but I think it's
these its

481
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,600
its fund around they're also confer
realize I think but

482
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,900
are to a large extent persian has helped
them even in solving crimes in her

483
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,600
injuries

484
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,830
using protection parisians on more

485
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,928
arm sensitive data to be

486
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:37,490
put on networks 16 but I networks wanted
to communicate

487
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,450
it's available you know through
subpoenas through witnesses through

488
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,880
forms and so on or just yes on mister us

489
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,330
also who dis though pleaded guilty are
among the evidence they

490
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,070
blocking on from him was is et/pt

491
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,310
which they did by putting out keyboards
never on

492
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,500
Plaza parking it in fact that I don't
want the one to his house

493
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,440
installed for they learned is key they
got his

494
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,270
his gambling records if it weren't for
the availability

495
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,740
berksten was gambling records would
probably not have been on this computer

496
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,860
in the first place

497
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:22,860
on that same note no there are also some
sleep easy but on a more attractive

498
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,740
platform understood his personal
information

499
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,419
down one of those is d the only thing
that was so

500
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,320
there about which is the creation of our
a trusted path inside

501
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,990
PC an attempt to prevent Trojan horses

502
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,370
you think he was the first things like
that from being able to circumvent the

503
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,770
first security measures which other you
install or more likely which Microsoft

504
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,570
installs

505
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,060
Tom is as close homes obviously

506
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,600
the bone

507
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,800
I think it's great

508
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,409
palladium is great it's so deep they
work hard

509
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:03,800
a largest I hope they go whole hog

510
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,659
yes strolls

511
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,970
with think that was a lot of it is
photography that

512
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,250
33 minutes away from people

513
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,520
it is anything anything that slows
people don't have freedom

514
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,220
yes not gonna work I mean what we know
about him for the Securities

515
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,780
right sleek any well-known

516
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,340
on and what palladium does wrong systems

517
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,210
lights on you look hot in here computers
from you

518
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,370
right it's worth it says will happen
computers from Microsoft

519
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,820
I it's so hot so there was a huge
difference between

520
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,649
the language fully

521
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:51,899
Council said go for it that much
confirmed by doctor both

522
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,850
not supposed to talk about digital world
pressure because of too much

523
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,419
but the earth real hello

524
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:03,330
real problem that the the thing that
makes my blood pressure go up the Los

525
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,408
is the subversion of the word

526
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:10,240
on up the idea trusted are they talk
about

527
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,460
trusted computing platforms but what
they're really saying is trusted by

528
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,280
people who don't own the computer to
prevent the owner of the computer from

529
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,070
doing what they want with

530
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,200
arm you know which which is is not work

531
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,149
are you into it we think both when I
think of something on your own

532
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:30,820
trustworthy com and

533
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,918
you know this this um attempt to build
machines

534
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,120
yeah are hostile to the interest of
their owner

535
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,130
are is seems to be misguided

536
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,450
love from also took 12 views not least
the workshop secured

537
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,800
I I want to understand what lying on my
computer

538
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,270
for security reasons box

539
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,360
with as right on the outside

540
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,460
on society's mom the demise

541
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,750
joplin's here that's something that
policy

542
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,840
yes a hong he's something and

543
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,310
right posit science I think really the
only effective

544
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,889
way that home to me

545
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,140
the ones is did not Jones here

546
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,280
mahjong parts of Lindsay's potholes

547
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,720
funeral is in place my yes

548
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,840
nothing why yet but

549
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,990
maybe even save us all some fun liquid
cocaine company

550
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:34,300
people here think digital rights
management is a good idea

551
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,149
they're really so there's no convincing
needed

552
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:42,480
climbers rushdie I think we should try
to do it

553
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,200
you know just let it happen and it was a
poet as a digital rights management will

554
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,750
donate money tonight

555
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,840
Billy that the science is settled behind
palladium

556
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,160
that nothing better than to happen just

557
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,500
will be so easy in life as the cell life
has engaged in this

558
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,710
refuelling this is not a long hot bath
homes me

559
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,280
the truth for the movement's told he was
never alone she

560
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,639
think so you know just both know there's
another problem that's been sobered

561
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,700
purchases tampering right below

562
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,730
campuses artwork and with them the

563
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,860
the Tampa love here is the person who
bought know this idea that I can buy

564
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,570
something

565
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,899
temple yeah it seems very strange

566
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,418
to Catherine models

567
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:38,418
tells hustle some members

568
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:45,800
me

569
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,250
for

570
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,339
well yeah but the only way to really the
question his

571
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:57,680
miles question the party's are

572
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,200
you meet people in this room of the
wrong haha splitting

573
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,859
ninety-some percent real users don't

574
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,980
then they went you know they'd call

575
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,410
Street use I'm you know I

576
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,839
McGuinty's people wrong and people can
run

577
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,069
so you have software anything wrong and
you have

578
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:23,220
you Dr which is preventing com

579
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,289
things from happening home you Nexus
samples

580
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:32,859
and of course my people on so yeah

581
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:36,410
not only one right people lot of people
are down

582
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,470
times program mop up the blood watching
with

583
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,569
and he did one other at a level that

584
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:46,920
part of the arm you know

585
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,270
practical claims the the Palladium offer

586
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,170
artist this is cataract that they say
that one person and

587
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,319
well break a this is Caleb rates

588
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:02,779
broken DRM scheme and about that they
will be able to propagate

589
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:07,089
change I wanna say I'll respond directly

590
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:11,000
you know that you're on the far side kid
sees

591
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,010
respond reckless about said on

592
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,369
say that you're absolutely right on and
thats

593
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,440
adoption positive allergies is a is

594
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,569
Israel is like upon the song on

595
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:29,770
we've seen in Seoul a few the areas that
people have been willing

596
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,170
to to adopt privacy technology on

597
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,150
wanna hear is highly doubt is that a lot
of people really are paranoid about

598
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,829
clinton's

599
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,609
on so there there has been

600
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:46,000
and and be a regular users to turn off
cookies so we think that at least one

601
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,770
example in each other

602
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,500
regular users you're taking over the
troubled

603
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,630
test themselves to was not necessarily
absolutely

604
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:01,240
essentially its rivals yet but

605
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,329
over there's a tendency for us to get a
little

606
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:09,390
talk about the saloon tomorrow on on up
was Mike's but I i'm

607
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,680
I'm a little less from optimistic that
you know just let them go ahead be there

608
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,618
were scattered such a stupid idea

609
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:20,460
aspect is it's tempting to say that but
you know laws and market forces are

610
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,670
are still powerful even he even even
when the wrong

611
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,480
arm you know the you know

612
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,770
for a while couldn't a he couldn't
export

613
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,490
for poverty whose no logging writing
photography as logging into your friends

614
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:36,789
but

615
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:41,349
gonna make the point that is the same as
wording but it was well as for today's

616
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:44,400
violent sport it was completely
effective

617
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,670
and keeping my purse of from including
bertram

618
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,270
the fall operating systems and horse on
or or any of the other on

619
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,380
on vendors you know for the most part
most love

620
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,599
the world particularly most the
commercial world is

621
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,230
some log were the offer for these
purposes so

622
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,460
you know even if even at the lowest you
can easily subverted Microsoft is not

623
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,359
likely to

624
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,950
teams that as the roadway with

625
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,369
II I still think it's important to

626
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:20,750
to to fight on those levels yep

627
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,450
young for fighting all although levels
unless

628

really dickey people who were on the
Internet

654
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:08,690
my mom I'm a

655
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,729
my mother doesn't understand why she

she's changed and why she had personal
firewall on her

659
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,259
cable until people understand this

660
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:33,430
you not get the software manufacturers
put out eating a hefty software

661
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,930
long garment is out there now you have
you

662
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,200
who is yes

663
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,299
concentrate but must be used in TV and
she's on TNT

664
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:49,299
love it it's a question of the Mac Pro
the

665
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:52,450
you know there was demand for preventing

666
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,640
credit card numbers being Smith over the
lawyer article was not a problem there

667
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,499
was no widespread demand for it and so
we got

668
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:04,529
arm we got browser a security group we
offer for that particular problem

669
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:10,789
are right now computer users for for in
a web page is the true dancing frogs to

670
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:13,829
your web pages that don't a

671
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:17,630
install a virus on your computer and %uh
until all

672
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,949
there is that once per consumer demand
you if you don't understand the details

673
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:25,400
I'll do it arm you know we're not gonna
be words

674
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,079
gonna manufactures shipping insecure
products surreal of

675
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:33,959
or

676
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:37,359
blossom I'm working on getting a rogers
& and his wife

677
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,400
journals your car and also secure yahaan

678
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,529
yes this is the address

679
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:47,660
I think it's a bad mood to say lead the
way

680
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,549
we've run into already him do it is free
software

681
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:54,999
HDTV vissi that they are really

682
00:41:54,999 --> 00:41:59,569
trying to me that they were checked and
I said today is pretty much content

683
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:01,069
providers leaving

684
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:04,160
it RIAA MPAA really want to

685
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,430
truncated people from the only equipment
that does what the customer wants to do

686
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,410
and they have gone so far as to a draft
legislation

687
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,420
it would be had for example I'm

688
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,469
receivers HDTV

689
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,089
the basic module here model which is a
priest three small

690
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:26,690
say they would like to and those that
didn't implement some kinda robustness

691
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,660
carrier their their model how he was she
is the one who said

692
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,979
it in the years other than the carriers

693
00:42:33,979 --> 00:42:37,989
it here and they want to convince all
the consumer electronics manufacturers

694
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:43,069
to under this it which personal not so
hot out there passing laws prohibit

695
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:46,390
so end result is this would be that

696
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,940
folks like us are no longer able to
build

697
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,640
software and freely distributed me with

698
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,808
we went to we said okay let's say is
there any way making

699
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,449
right opens or so three pieces of the
comply with which one only one game

700
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:05,739
it was a yes yes USA you know this

701
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:10,869
this is obviously a min am I now live
always sure he's a dangerous path to the

702
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:11,400
game

703
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,440
ago time sunday it is 300 about

704
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,569
my my position like on

705
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:21,739
it is possible for governments

706
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:25,049
and and Chris Houston home on

707
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:30,079
when they included yet to try it sell
you the the industry the cartel

708
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,309
introduces a product its takes
government mandates

709
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:36,729
no other product image is between them
on

710
00:43:36,729 --> 00:43:40,449
they said situation value has been
knocked out marketplace

711
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:44,739
writes it is a the value good
information technology is no longer a

712
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:45,319
harsh

713
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:49,269
on so that's that's that's the threat
that

714
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:52,880
that people are making loss out I think

715
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,789
that's a pretty great situation but I
don't think it's that

716
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:00,099
likely I think is more likely that a
time

717
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:04,249
somebody these these forces Allah ke
huge chunks

718
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:07,329
value our side to the good guys

719
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:10,900
that we come out stronger I would say
that file sharing isn't

720
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,359
wonderful example yeah everybody's

721
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:18,180
fileshare everybody about monster blog
you know

722
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,698
striking walk along with a dollar bill

723
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:24,749
on that's because all the value as they
handed

724
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:28,199
costs as a tool for our site for the
guys and

725
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,660
police %um is nothing but volume saw its

726
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,808
hopes about living volatile consumers
heading

727
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:39,099
cost place so I think it's a potentially
wonderful strategic tool

728
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:42,920
like begin this loss get the software
written

729
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,549
yeah it's the most important arts right
the

730
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:50,339
open standards talking

731
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:53,349
why of you to lotteries

732
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:56,759
Cardinals one home and this this is
great

733
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:59,989
problem wanna on home prices teens

734
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,190
you

735
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,460
of once England's team won prizes

736
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:10,150
%um are you see with the harsh
regulatory environment

737
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:13,349
a lot of the for 20 technology talent

738
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:16,599
on moving offshore armed

739
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,460
you see that is a trained in the future
interesting

740
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,969
he in bosnia thank you certainly was for
a while

741
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:28,589
arm you know when we had harsh words for
wasn't US work that

742
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:31,670
courage was it all okay non-u_s_ for
bill

743
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:36,819
this for arm its fortunately for most
products in there are some exceptions

744
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:37,910
rugby

745
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,930
routers one of the most notable most

746
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:44,049
mass market products ask for those
really

747
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:47,210
from last and that we've fix

748
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:51,489
on week States that problem by

749
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:54,719
March Arthur there is a risk low be

750
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,630
the US whatever the US regulatory
structure is

751
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,039
has impact all over the world by the US
is a big market

752
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,259
our losses and beads or so that's where
he is on

753
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:10,349
US policy against the exported to other
countries

754
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:13,469
home you know implicitly or explicitly

755
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:18,229
so it's fields do I didn't move off to
remain on

756
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:25,130
these I'll

757
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,249
I think believe there's a public demand
for

758
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:33,700
that there's certain age and very high
star 31 president over

759
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,180
a lot more money or is that the
productivity but regionally

760
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,940
but as for correspondence will be home
save this isn't operating a case of his

761
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,059
his in Haiti

762
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:47,719
he does maybe start he's in jail

763
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:52,540
be easier %uh ouija

764
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,990
yeah the ETag

765
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,660
there is there is a I believe is a
market for the holiday

766
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,299
he stresses the lights are low but if
he's interested so fucking

767
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,360
every I see is technologically she said

768
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,250
Italy do any good to have the Users
folder is it saying it's faster

769
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,970
if it's only people who is able to carry
overall male

770
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,670
three police security dead run the

771
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:22,570
a is a paid holiday 88 people to you

772
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,370
to provide dollars out for the real his
his

773
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,220
it yeah this is an excellent probably
have to convince people that there is an

774
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,100
application that

775
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,580
mother needs for anonymity arm

776
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,160
and right there hasn't then this was a
great wrestler

777
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,879
handle it some other with a remembrance
came up with this phrase

778
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,930
there hasn't been a day privacy valdez

779
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,470
right you know this bill personal data
that

780
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:53,020
that's been busy the whole once there is
that might be

781
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,560
are uncertainly inevitable are once it
happens that might be the

782
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,620
event that causes people to see to wake
up and say

783
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,850
arm on I'm worried about all the state
about worried about habits being

get worse before they get better

797

hard thing to her

798
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:58,210
insights on how each year currency yes
you know

799
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,820
pop big thing some reporter was able to
tease

800
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:09,820
me so that the actual awesome 1

801
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,700
from both you know the king's name

802
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,990
he had seen dress: on telling

803
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:22,150
islands

804
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:26,070
my question is a only chair optimism

805
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:31,010
about a the possibility of government
and the industry

806
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,080
commuting and taking value of the
marketplace

807
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,790
but that's not so realistic are I think

808
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,890
a one side saying well there's a
possibility that the Sun coming up in

809
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:42,410
the morning

810
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,549
but that's not a realistic this is today
this is the world we live in

811
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,520
we're going to a couple years from now
biotechnology more more technology

812
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,930
that's not able to do

813
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,180
people you know my mother was the one
that just copy still

814
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,169
going to buy cameras going to be
surrounded by a secure legal technology

815
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,620
to a large extent it's already happening

816
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,790
the laws are in place that I

817
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,090
the technologies his I think I think
we're going to see is this actually

818
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,460
happening what we live in this room here

819
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,090
has been already characterized by by
these people as the analog hole

820
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,410
this is where we ate i think is a
mistake to be 18

821
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,109
we have a lot more going for a stimulus
for example passport

822
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,230
and dotnet didn't work

823
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:28,320
and they have an audience are moon party
game over the strength of

824
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,990
sound its

825
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,060
it's not that started to sing we guns

826
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,700
costs in with a then

827
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:45,150
taking collusion between begins to
government as as a remote possibility is

828
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,410
him yeah one thing that we're losing

829
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:53,120
essentially good teacher arms

830
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,069
well got us where we are now whole
computer internet revolution

831
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,580
is an outgrowth I no longer time but I
left a hundred want to keep dangerous

832
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,590
think the following overcoming

833
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:10,510
on
