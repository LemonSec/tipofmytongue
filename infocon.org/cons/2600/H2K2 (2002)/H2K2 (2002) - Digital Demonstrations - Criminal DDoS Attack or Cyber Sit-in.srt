00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,150
other Tulsa its but at the moment I'm
experiencing

8

no

20
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,550
I think this on

21
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,980
letter and demonstration you can define
as a gathering of people to bed

22
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,580
tension less simple and that's what

23
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,520
I will talk about here a.m. expressing
your political opinion by getting

24
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,550
from demonstration actually

25
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,810
or then the whole thing saw thousands

27
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,140
political society and every

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,820
democracy nowadays its estimates there

29
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,480
demonstrations someday of political
expression

30
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,010
all so

31
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,340
we have to see how we can take this

32
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,020
this is the world on homie

33
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,330

all intentional on the season's across
the hall

37
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,479
if you've got a few thousand people
people will see

38
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,669
of the media social

39
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,820
that something happening best all this
time he lol

40
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,840
as of the decision to make us lose
usually

41
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,690
though to demonstrate a place that the
decision makers

42
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,660
s to see you at massey as fast and
that's that

43
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,870
the sidewalk to buy a house always

46
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,169
okay many parliament's prohibit
demonstrations

47
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:24,830
directly on the building's facade of the
building

48
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,979
to keep it fresh away from the members a
golden's

49
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,360
you know all so why does that all along

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,810
today attention of administrators

51
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,570
fast get whatever you do on and the
attention of people lining the services

52
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,080
throughout

53
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,020
attacking to get the attention of the
media

54
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,710
and have to get the attention of us is

55
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,739
usually can't get that attention of

56
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,910
decision made us because the station may
have

57
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,479
don't use the internet I don't use the
internet

58
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,719
they had legislator on

59
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,849
you can get there in that way

60
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,430
potentially by getting the attention of
the media

61
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,650
so so my

62
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,640

63
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,740

characteristics of unosom demonstration

75
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,490
the first thing as you have to go there

76
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,740
you have to get out of your chair and go
to demonstrate

77
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,200
a.m. that means usually

78
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,550
you jack going to demonstrate as the
demonstrations near you

79
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,380

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,860
say johnnie to demonstrate a

81
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,000

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,270
on and

83
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,909
if you go then we'll be seeing yeah that
means

84
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,160
well yeah on the one hand yeah anonymous
in any way

85
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,280
yeah yet another loss but keeping can't
find out who

86
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,260
I me it's just a few and yet thousands

87
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,370
this that actually sensible a so is that

88
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,870
2000 people you know then see that 2000
Jeep

89

nobody can can understand how many keep
participating in demonstrations

90
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,930
a.m. okay

91
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,590
usually the people optimizing a
demonstration say all that

92
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,970
being 100,000 people and the police as

93
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,730
all that being got fifty thousand people
about lot about

94
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,750
and sense how many other on

95
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,390
up it's a lot of law

96
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,830
and all-state characteristics of

97
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:45,830
online station

98

187
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,730
officials a the idea came from people in
Italy

188
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,160
lead thought I feel kinda along that
side

189
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,660
pay by at Mexico

190

they're accepting the page though

192
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,500
slut slut slut division massive by this
is all set

193
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,750
and is thought

194
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,209
picked up by the funny just us theater
who else is off to a fast lap

195
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,560
match lost basically a yeah but

196
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,089
spitz I am

197
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,190
nato yeah that which we know that

198
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,079
automatic here with the same as the Tay
page

199
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,220
any I think that in six lanes

200
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,140
and these people sideshows

201
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,780
and that sources it's like a father

202
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,810
all this symbolic nations and

203
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,980
goal is not 20 takedown service

204
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,449
to set a standard at connectors

205
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,640
three nations think Lake Park

206
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,780
pong a.m. then the buses

207
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,280
demonstrations against the they envision

208
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,420
better let me send me a lot use mostly
the same stuff back

209
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,780
a.m. but told that 11

210
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,100
case ever her people participating

211
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,209
and which shows that the

212
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:07,220
face organizations much more and his
band

213
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,560
makes doesn't and

214
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,940
the people at the electronic the status
theater

215
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,890
develop some keep on this an online
demonstration

216
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,630
should should be transplant

217
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,939
it should be that's the last three
actions there yes yes this

218
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,990
just action doesn't change thing

219
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,400
should be piled but I'm not sure
non-violence

220
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,910
digital rate any and jus should use

221
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,930
own sauce told introduced saint schools

222
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,030
so everybody understands what happened

223
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,220
vessel may up now them

224
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,770
usually nobody understands what's
happening on the internet

225
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,890
except us no media understand no
decision may have understand

226
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,390
a.m. and I think you simple who was with

227
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,310
for and that was the slowest and special

228
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,669
this time does flying

229
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:10,130
and fathers government injured
immigrants

230
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,169
to fund stage and and the last 10 years

231
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,250
to me goods die on the flight

232
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,780
and people try to make those times I
stop doing that

233
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,089
in the hope that the government to
change its policy

234
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,220
on he immigrants and

235

241
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,408
this devastation got the inspiration

00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:58,130
I'll demonstrations bus of

243
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,210

250
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,129
so do you think it connections to the

251
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,110
and other so and all the time sad

252

and chasing which thing which

254
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,690
its most that haha I

255
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,929
for 2x editor people says meaningful
stuff only about money

256

261
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,590
accepted connection says us say

262
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,780
and it's very difficult to say

263
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,480
first demonstration was a success and
some keep its namesake

264

just understand services that and the
fact that and Exchange

266
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,880
inside up but everything law
sophisticated

now

329
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,580
based on the bench with consumption so

330
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,559
lost lawless just healers offices and

331
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,260
this lots of fellow student

332
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,720
of many and those times demonstration
people's lives not

333
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,840
only basin special that also

334
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,158
while some processing on the thought of
that but Wallace's

335
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,710
all about that convention today and

336
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,990
yes thinking about post-convention that

337
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,309
me my post tag to ask questions

338
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:55,309
me a lot of mine it's the

339
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,830
tag said it's a small side on

340
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:05,139
patients fachet idea by and .nom.es

341
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:08,389
and several on that its

342
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:13,049
other it today that's all and just
talking to you know that page

343
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:16,158
out of time power they usually

344
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,590
will get a hefty the at the end of the
match month for that bad

345
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,330
and on the other hand the small side I

346
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,019
not like talking to them faith the

347
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,279
I think this is not a good idea to it

348
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,529
that's that's a lot of pot fishing shop
and

349
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:38,870
to demonstrate against the and piston
engine NT 5.0

350
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,070
whatever the if you do this

351
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,220
banja transaction type of town special
issues

352
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,409
with us usually get the time hours thank

353
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:52,039
users president says the site and

354
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,000
issue at hand was processing times

355
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,860
a.m. that's one thing her

356
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,860
less process

357
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,220
and can be fast you need a lot of
processing

358
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,360
that test against them she fights out
her

359
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,590
for cropped up of me such a camp and
please

360
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,620
way that patches said

361
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,760
said said to depose just popping off by
US

362
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,240

eating at system this house is like
PHD's

380

fire connection but they still I just

393
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,520
many and sometimes that additional that

394
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,299
fighting follow us and other
state-of-the-art

395
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,379
my mind lights off tht

396
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:33,440
PD but the most thanks belongs

397
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,659
face it mezzo many este

398
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:40,919
and need a lot of leche lost

399
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,480
nation south side little many

400
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,360
things that usually the thoughts of us

401
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,539
which dominating today pesci

402
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:55,679
1c yes and they have car hire

403
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,369
of think I limit it means that no

404
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:04,700
far of while 150 processors default
configuration which means

405
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,179
a the patches %uh time just the thought
of jewish

406
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,230
and more than 150 plants being sexy at
the same time

407
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,399
so issue what national

408
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,590
get one another

409
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,570
you with us investing pages exactly the
same time

410
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,770
and i think is a get lulled the

411
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,340
using system resources to slow down
south operating system this office

412
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,070
is very found are a vision system

413
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,918
celebrities the connection operating
system news service offers

414
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:46,279
and bus on CBS do that as

415
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,600
bus systems but this one any

416
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,700
connections loss and so on them

417
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,379
as this of usually that is what
protectors

418
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:59,470
operating system designers put a lot of

419
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,210
thought those because about 10

420
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,619
this this base officers sauce for a long
time

421
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,909
and single-season flooding which was
exactly

422
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:14,179
today this operating system sauce

423
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:18,070
so to slow down the left so what should
be our

424
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,029
does Israel on demonstrate on

425
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:25,080
should laws to keep to

426
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,110
hot us social keep down the band both
transactions

427
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,240
Ancelotti sellers the same hosting
centers on long

428
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,230
effective the Internet all along it

429
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,919
and if possible show The Voice

430
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,179
keeping think it was %uh that's so

431
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:48,000
this machine just posting 2000 website

432
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,119
just gone through a

433
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:57,270
demonstrate against 1s don't want to
slow down to South

434
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,250
but media hot and we want to show

435
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,649
up yes modification of saudi

436
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:07,799
yeah so everybody should be able to see

437
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,799
our and PhD in Computer Science that
this administration

438
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,908
and and Fisher but to maintain videos

439
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:19,049
relation between participate yes

440
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:22,520
and let's call it damage at

441
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,179
so if that 100 people

442
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:29,409
the online demonstrations it should the

443
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:34,010
10 and pants that the effect as if their
house

444
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,029
and and in my mind

445
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,289
the people taking part in a
demonstration should be

446
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:45,700
accountable which means not people's

447
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,500
issue I expressed political opinion
specialist and

448
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,539
up for that prosecutors are taking part
in a demonstration

449
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:58,349
and now I will show two concepts

450
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:01,369
when it seems cool a.m.

451
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,490
to my was a have been used in on them

452
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,629
sessions the fastest except

453
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:11,349
flooding am

454
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:14,750
that foster's up of another

455
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,250
process them and he's

456
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,639
stay is take and accept lot not

457
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:24,919
uni you but it has the east and then

458
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,149
contact on London's best you connect to
the best up

459
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,230
things to do three-way handshake

460
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,889
a.m. and then you don't send fast

461
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:41,320
so %uh stop process and test wage

462
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,799
for you best to be completed states in
los angeles-based

463
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:50,369
time of eventually and usually after me
and it's a

464
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:54,230
his yes just three-way handshake shot
just the

465
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,649
few dozen by s you can't I have

466
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:02,049
one subsys first we had said

467
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:09,049
apartments its these changes the night
before

468
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:14,130
in that is this thing safe love them and
no

469
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,220
am the send

470
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,360
slotting do won't even complete 23 May
and share

471
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,950
but a.m. was except that it

472
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,210
you stop her compete illegitimate
connection

473
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,929
but just on century fast I'm

474
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:37,529
the last thing as spoofing this is
really a just

475
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,760
so people counter doesn't use that much
traffic a.m.

476
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,230
a people a

477
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:52,100
defending against a demonstration much
for the time house on the south side

478
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,940
and so it won't have affair phone

479
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,110
no we don't test flights and League
Soccer

480
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,200
over this is accepted for the ninth a

481
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,929

and says hot face but his

484
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,679
some calls its to the now

485
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,890
service that chose to thought it was
safe landing

486
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,429
and it its to

487
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,000
you 0 something and leave it alone and
%uh so as to handle that

488
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,950
put the usually me difficult to explain
to a

489
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,190
Josh what you are doing and

490
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,510
that this is a allegedly made from a
away

491
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:43,270
to do with them fish cyaaa

492
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,879
fight them iPod communicating snow D

493
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,000
and you

494
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,950
acting all the way like a regular love
new

495
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,289
tools at thing Rep Basel this could be

496
00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:01,590
implemented SFRC which city Java

497
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,409
bother demonstrated against side and

498
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:09,589
but we don't do it slow very slow am

499
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,000
because of this legal well

500
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,280
called consume a lot of bands but just
sending

501
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,730
say character said and

502
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,250
but dusted tired love system the sauce

503
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,129
the stuff the difficult thing

504
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:32,460
about this is that the city was designed
and st.

505
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,470
this that the so

506
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,980
doing and you have tools a little bit a

507
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,949
it is a piece that and to keep it from
a.m.

508
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:47,469
possibly outpost in and so on them

509
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:53,280
if yeah from the K-sixty was means yes
it happened connection with a handshake

510
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,540
the southwest of our other said

511
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,109
fast and then spent stats any

512
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:03,240
best one collector out that

513
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,260
time so the usual

514
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,480
http/1.1 better what take say

515
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,580
functions to said with all the Hess

516
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,299
and the mess I usually

517
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,800
s this lunchtime then

518
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,070
just listening to a Tammy best in
blocking i/o

519
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,200
so this child be tight with and do it
best

520
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,250
and and

521
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,650
says user unit so just

522
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,940
and few thousand processors

523
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,210
are like a total pesci thought

524
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,290
in just 10 150 was

525
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,730
one other sister died last month picture
so it would be tight

526
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,910
humpty both without them demonstrates
that the so

527
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:00,098
human and and its

528
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,460
last dance at least pesci spent a lot

529
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,080
of process time even in this locking
I'll

530
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,740
because both implementers not very
efficient

531
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,800
the bus is a certain a.m. this

532
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,410
not the usual looking ahead she has to
hand and

533
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,710
than Joey thank you a that he then
slowly

534
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,510
this that can happen several things

535
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,940
and if the patient has the fastest its

536
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,650
may be slow way is Shaw

537
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,080
that's a the oath of the K pesci

538
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,509
world completely hand over that of the
page for the operating system

539
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,810
though it is just a little behind it
Center

540
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,950
one character to you so

541
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,630
so that sa missing you process

542
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:55,089
it's not tight anymore and

543
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:58,770
but the operating system has too bad

544
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,349
and operating systems not designs

545
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:06,089
tool behind us hundreds of me bytes of
data

546
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:09,210
so if you are requesting and its
thousands this

547
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,859
and cages this way and

548
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:16,509
operating system tends to get Wednesday
and

549
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,520
action and place and if the pages latter

550
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,580
the existing does not bother

551
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,750
hold page initial whatever

552
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,130
and that process tight heart attack say

553
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:36,540
got all the data operating system but
fun sending

554
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,810
by by his less K so

555
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,740
says and so others

556
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,069
slow communication as tying

557
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:50,640
Nino fans but a lot of this awesome
sauce

558
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,319
and

559
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:58,619
nasty you might be a bit text and

560
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:02,660
jacks the same the just something

561
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,868
doing it slowly as it relates to
political both test

562
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,430
at least johnnie them a

563
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:15,040
class at the government offices not
allowed to the demonstrations

564
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,210
and that's something that caused that
pushed

565
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,750
so we are walking the strip the after
who is

566
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,040
slowly am and

567
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,710
say even all this website pensions

568
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,310
no way might be accepted about happy

569
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,520
so I'm Afghanistan well demonstration
yeah

570
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,080
nothing a.m. it's very happy

571
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,380
take 69 less so cute and who's this

572
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,390
but they houses at fatherland so test

573
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,900
hand past a.m.

574
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,780
but

575
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,680
it's a difficult to school is it that
both times

576
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,029
because I feel owning tools though

577
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,070
so it was time heart am

578
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,720
the big bonus still his posts

579
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,830
on whatever you do if the

580
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,990
following website is hosted on a bus or
subway

581
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:18,020
of a.m.

582
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,040
in my mind this way if the best way

583
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,180
if you decide to do a demonstration
slowing down silos

584
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,350
but that the the way to go huge

585
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,500
am like this but %uh said City

586
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,830
people said bosses symbolic action and
symbolic actions

587
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,850
get used up to of thing

588
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,120
Davis slowing down South

589
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,890
what's let me hot to West partly and

590
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:52,580
a.m. everything be to put political
opinions

591
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,230
in a demonstration like far online

592
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,530
needs you raised this

593
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:04,260
meet come along let's do

594
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,500
think you have to do it by with reign of
King

595
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,550
national much a.m. mastheads

596
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,650
campus a with a socket

597
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,570
both of us a soft heart of this list

598
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,980
special southbound and candy all

599
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,600
at the HS any by

600
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,670
frustrating and arch

601
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,690
your thing and the

602
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,300
that page HTTP any

603
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,660
from next on that you though %uh issue

604
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,390
the 0 %ah a .de

605
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:49,240
a.m. fight against link to this page

606
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,310
for slides for the presentation on that

607
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,080
on that side is on

608
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,660
follow thank you so much for possible
demonstration them

609
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:06,660
get it best %ah

610
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:16,140
in the online

611
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:22,670
which is still trying to get media in

612
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:29,670
this book called XD sure thing there's
no other way to the online demonstration

613
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,330
because them most people don't recognize
whatever you do

614
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,540
except you I had to slow down our

615
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,680
ones first salutes

616
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,730
this sprouts just

617
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,880
this almost

618
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,810
years the to settle

619
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,180
how long your processes I'll

620
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,330
in stay we have to solve it

621
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,960
a.m. others last %ah

622
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,870
loss follows doing a lot of
communication it unless of the past

623
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:14,080
using the sides cause alarm well
overloaded though he slow

624
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,360
and missile sectors happening on

625
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,710
things the context he said

626
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,430
its on the new bombs let

627
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,850
so on boss just some take it easy some

628
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,509
evil software loss tearing down the
Internet

629
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,410
but issue never to a hot item

630
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,960
special out of lands part of sanctions

631
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,590
me yes apartments on just yes in snowy
on that side of the stanza

632
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,160
its much like to pose on

633
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,140
edge the making well that this is a

634
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,210
this nationalism and people particular
purpose

635
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,100
others so you with offline your whole
sizes

636
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,220
action your taking servicemen's yeah

637
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,580
yet of and and I think it's very
important that

638
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,680
others W can delay already asking

639
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,870
Kathy anonymous but left after cat can
detach

640
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:20,089
an IP address so somebody's in

641
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:24,440
messing something up possible I was with
this stuff at last can't buy

642
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,770
suspect dante is above with just her

643
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,130
I think a few weeks ago

644
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,130
along with a call move Hong Kong

645
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,240
took over Chinese Sep digital satellite

646
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,900
and the plot them message or satellite
what do you think a long

647
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,600
him

648
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,850
that's a big difference between the
things

649
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,490
allowed to consider cool and the things
which

650
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:02,910
lock school change up shit options of
politicians and other decision-makers

651
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:08,529
and and usually you can if you look like
to state so this classic supposedly

652
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:12,220
the demonstration people gathered myself
opinion

653
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,810
and that's the best way and goal you see
that

654
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,320
EV this stuff mean peace and so on

655
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,060
that's being just dozens of people and

656
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,380
blocking a lot of things and is accepted
by the general public

657
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,970
of justice

658
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,230
it

659
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:39,160
years he spoke with

660
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,200
so that kills in with what he said

661
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,500
about the home %uh

662
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,119
protests I or

663
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,859
for their on actions anyway

664
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,109
I its it's different from a traditional

665
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:02,460
protest it this may seem very cool

666
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,750
know it's not want directly directly
affect

667
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,869
the government positions

668
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:13,020
for people in authority powerful were

669
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,650
what may have been effective by City

670
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,690
key get I their ideas their concerts
across

671

672
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:28,319
and yes a by that says

673
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,279

700
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:10,349
so it takeover block past station and
sent a message

701
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:15,020
hours on television you won't call it
the most patient the other hand

702
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,740
I haven't seen education up to now which

703
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,859
up shit to me to be really a political
thing that things

704
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:27,500
people defacing mom and pops fishing
shop saying we are doing this against

705
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,520
the law against

706
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,720
anything and ask them why do you go on
the website

707
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,710
nobody's business anytime and lemme see
this high

708
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:39,690
both fighters Haslem's I can't
understand political message

709
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,880
in putting people and sexual

710
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,059
positions on the ass awesome website a

711
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:49,130
that might be cool about another

712
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,180
political opinion or something like that
and the NC

713
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,750
somebody page side was a.m.

714
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,349
put it to a vote on it and and put on a
political message

715
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:04,079
but putting a fluffy bunny was he on the
WTOL

716
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,690
website doesn't change anything yeah

717
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,849
this

718
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:15,349
I actually have a team teapot so

719
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:18,660
ones for technical point of view

720
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,368
social I workers lost or

721
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,660
over a news website and we get attacked

722
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,000
for a bus continuously

723
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,290
so we have a some experience in dealing
with denial of service attacks

724
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,320
I juror your whole point there

725
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,119
about you mimicking to a regular user is

726
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:43,800
is right or you are me five in general

727
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,280
closer something close to a regular user

728
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,710
%uh the harder it is for us to stop you
know and we have some

729
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,720
very talented people here so you know
see things

730
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,940
we can you can see it us is fluttered

731
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,380
we can see a spider it's crawling
through hitting every single page or

732
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,800
hearings on database intensive page
repeatedly or anything like that

733
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,200
we can do whatever you know where we can
feasibly do to stop these days

734
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,730
I'll years old you were from

735
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,300
from from both sides for from me from a
judicial

736
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,270
you we have something that maybe
eventually looked at

737
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:27,400
of Joe's and you want to look like a
regular user and not look like you do

738
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,010
something

739
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,430
illegitimate that's right oh and also
technical

740
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,649
from them doing something to stop the

741
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,940
also

742
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,359
arm from the other side for social

743
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,719
you I love the her

744
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,910
a good and so the other so the other
commenters a sizzling about this but

745
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:55,649
you know I think the impose you'll have
a few limited options

746
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,519
you can either been slow to the website
get rid of the website

747
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,799
replace the website some house you and
over these

748
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:07,940
you know the the slowdown me the widget
getting her to the website

749
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,489
replace it with something else
definitely is but those are the only

750
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:12,410
ones

751
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:16,680
you know that have a real effect on
replacing it hasn't potential to get

752
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,989
your message

753
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:21,729
across you're saying he's been linked
with haha

754
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:26,539
processes people know why this website
is down but the fact of the matter is a

755
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:29,809
you intake down to CNN dot com he

756
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:34,979
a low were well you know a hundred or so
the people who this is CNN dot heart

757
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:39,229
no that is not there but points users
your one percent of them are gonna know

758
00:50:39,229 --> 00:50:40,420
why is life there

759
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,609
you no matter how big of a protest is
isn't it

760
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:47,779
reach most visitors also you that's not
really

761
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:52,650
I don't feel there's a really effective
way to get your message across and

762
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:56,809
so far the most affected online protest

763
00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:00,609
900 was yes here in haiti is the CTA

764
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:04,459
where they had people a a turn their web
page is black

765
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:07,709
the put lingering graphics on the web
pages

766
00:51:07,709 --> 00:51:11,099
so this has nothing to do with the
people that they're protesting

767
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:15,829
insulating go after senator exon's
website or the website %uh the US

768
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:17,369
Congress rate

769
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:20,809
it is you know it it has the
characteristics that you're talking

770
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:21,449
about

771
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:25,279
its is traceable individual people who
visit particular pages

772
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:29,190
its proportional to the number people
participating in the more people we get

773
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,029
that has been

774
00:51:30,029 --> 00:51:33,799
were often you see this graphic were
often you see work with pages

775
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:37,499
yes says people care about this issue

776
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:41,469
I'll it has all the good effects without
having

777
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:44,749
any the negative effects absolutely

778
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:47,779
there's there's no question it being
legit

779
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:53,369
or anything like that I'll so it seems
to me that that's something like that

780
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:57,799
list people inside over a desert go
after

781
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:03,140
somebody else's sir has the has all the
characters

782
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,308
it's another demonstration that's like
putting at

783
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:09,329
action hey and tell us a better day

784
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:14,089
your house that's completely different
special I'm sorry our time is hot

785
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,759
and I'll be outside of questions up next
and

786
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:22,170
some thank you very much good luck
