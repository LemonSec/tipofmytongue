shown will tell you be more about our
back from you

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,780

yesterday's

20
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,909
not a trivial electronics on today's
digital

21
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,580
enhances it I we could probably raise
escaped or purdue has not been for

Burnie TAS to a couple weeks ago dole's

23
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,250
h2k to this time around existing

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,299
already feel very privileged every year
we initially thought said

25
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,310
they wouldn't fit into the cell bandits
discussions in Charlotte Ronson who

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,250
more do want our children to show our
website JCC

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,920

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,960
Yahoo single yet for nasa as a listener
who's been with us since the beginning

it was funny feedback and so glad it was

31
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,950
so are questions call

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,500
body get solutions that are answer is
valueble electronics from the 70's and

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,100
80's

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,990
we feel the Golden Age Electronics the
other best

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,319
constructive designed electronics serve

36
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,140
for our lifetimes anyway may be looking
around

37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,750

station so and I think I'm I was
actually doing a talk on

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,910
on Sunday morning could be talking about
shortwave radio

47
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,200
capitan can try

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,660
on 7.4 150 acres

49
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,670
you fight is tomorrow night's ten
o'clock

50
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,420
talking about vintage electrons largely
doing it to the show live from our

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,920
the bell yesterday would have

69
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,519
low hungry survivors early original
holes are only watches

70
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,090
all these pple kiosk it's on the second
floor the

71
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,180
main moviegoers but no better than I did
so on till

72
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,280
for that drop we draw people over to the
website

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,490
nobody thousands you know maybe by
virtue that too

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,169
are seeing people lining up for a new
releases a game systems like anything

90
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,680
but does is a by Dover Heights

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,889

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,750
reeva phantom gonna

93
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,850
market jugglers digital watches Cindy
was it okay go back to that

94
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,220
the wrong one here the

95
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,220
the new FBI guys tainted was caught
here's a

96
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,520
and mine well

97
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,310
breezy defeat his and his elves is silly
get our act together because

98
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,830
more than about 6:15 are I'm for
maintenance bar are rare with me

99
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,419
as room of my and India show originates
for sure which station

100
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,530
balm Bridgeport area and the nephew

101
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,139
as down here plenty of time he

102
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,050
so it's not just a simple and

103
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,289
these electronic take for granted as are
all around us will

104
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,750
it is a shrewd every development built
upon

105
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,000
the previous one think it says more
emotional attachment

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,120
I've been a bit silly my grandparents
and my grandfather

107
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,190
a blue collar worker standing works in
connecticut

108
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,639
I got his first electronic the
calculator

109
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,050
probably a 1974 something that morning's
tired

110
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,130
and just a song a farmers market and

111
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,039
he was caught up in a tweet 2009
wannabes and handle

112
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,229
calculators and he's in line with the
engineers is an island

113
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,979
right when he brought with me engineer
boxes revisionist history this is my

114
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,349
grandmother told me that my smartphone

115
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:11,680
so i think is a anyway I don't think my
grandfather's you're out today with the

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,930
larger one loser Microsoft x-box

117
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,370
come on have buy microsoft certainly
contributed to our

118
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,330
revolution technological here a lot of
things really good things for our own

119
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,370
yes it's very stable we all know

120
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,060
my supply for 20 me the haploid

121

screened old

122
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,560
when you but I Paul II have recounted
our memories of a

123
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,810

applications everywhere you know it but
are because on the LCD generation

134
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,090
just curtailing the LED generation i

135
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,610
like that about 2,000 miles launches

136

together

157
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,110
I hope I don't feel wish or changes were
I was organized like to be

158
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,910
that covering the yellow any questions
that we have

159
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,939
well I love think malls a walking
encyclopedia love

160
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,040
a handheld games and the same for
additional launches from you got to lose

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,050
like anything

162
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,269
yes Obama some what's that like as a
route to it

163
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,690
future it is I does approximate

164
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,120
values look to believe that so there is
coming to the wrong

165
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,180
when these things a I'm he barely eats a

166
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,579
and the man had no flea markets in the
parking lot

167
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,950
markets easy people trying to get twenty
thirty dollars these things but you know

168
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,430
a few years earlier than 50 cent

169
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,850
so so as a friend

170
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,980
take a look at those needs the you
happen to push the owner

171
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,370
vigilant wrong item just really like we
do our show

172
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,110
mister just got to the microphone more

173
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,920
Aston as kuwaiti and a watch that the
you think you can't

174
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,040
every pair I may have news for you
probably one of the few people that

175
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,800
I'll here LCD watches but the former

176
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,180
you do 1 yeah

177
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,700
they were

178
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,760
this guy he's a wireless mic meh I'm

179
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,850
yeah well now the stove with possible

180
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,940
without the building block fully
integrated circuit

181
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,500
and as she is overdue appreciation for
these items like boom boxes

182
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,760
and waffles those pockets he's

183
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,060
we'll see what says the voters in all
sorts of course malls are washes and

184
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,519
market gonna lose it I think

185
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,550
its botstein we'll see any year

186
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,000
in references the 21 genius a

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,089
jack kilby and CEO wasn't essential is a
very the object will be

188
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,980
where 1950 age actually a

189
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,649
total deserves most of the credit
business is desirable to

190
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,390
ended up being put into production just
a few years with jack kilby a

191
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,399
user does the authors the summer 1958 he
was in texas instruments and nine

192
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,980
put together this Sun whose hassle
papers which song is that chip that

193
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,660
contains all the transistors

194
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,949
first visit is is the their systems now
they've

195
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,200
it was a really know what an integrated
circuit is at home in 10

196
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,600
10 North Point all

197
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,010
we saw it as a is a free t-shirt a I
don't blame anyone saw you know we've

198
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,100
got it is all about self-promotion grows

199
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,970
with get dirty shoes BBC Two surely
teachers who

200
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,660
okay give me a give it comes to my phone
to your explanation

201
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,339
a great certain Turner

202
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:32,830
but no 724

203
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,840
harlem if the problem still gestures
something September 11 discussion if you

204
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,560
want

205
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,540
a market that is why the business we're
going to yeah

206
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,670
it okay that's fine live with my laptop

207
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,330
basically is

208
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:57,330
lockhart very all

209
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,040
are

210
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,480
so it really is yeah proposition is used

211
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,329
part

212
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:17,329
Lee me

213
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:28,199
me

214
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,510
okay bonus pushing

215
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,000
was a CMOS chip agreement higher

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,190
hey all you want a sure sign of okay

217
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,430
we know this guy yeah hours a day

218
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,060
good on gotta

219
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,750
got jack kilby jack kilby visit is
usually a pretty good

220
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,080
the policy was talking about you know as
soon as I started this from the start it

221
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,690
but

222
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,480
I i mean reports that up to this day
jack kilby

223
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,870
in that city's computer literate and

224
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,910
yes for yet one regret that the
integrated circuit those electronic

225
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,550
greeting cards which should

226
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,110
game is all about 25 six years ago
things you love about me

227
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,720
message it live musical dream

228
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,800
he wanted to invite the icy hey don't
want product know it's obvious that

229
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,500
really had no idea that

230
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,580
the direction that there wasn't a it
raises to announce it

231
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,620
invested in 1947 W I took about 15 years
and

232
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,230
whose implementation the haha stuff is
your house or the others the transistor

233
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,840
radios

234
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,200
other items this should only take about
seven years in the freezer to be a

235
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,910
gentleman who

236
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,920
social ideas for and he had no idea what
it would happen if he's a

237
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,150
was recognized with the normal Prize in
Physics a couple years issues a

238
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,050
below the guys in here market a

239
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,560
if I had known I gang members remain

240
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,880
Haley and from the oval in shape

241
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,730
move in its own good so the long lines
into one truly dollar me this release

242
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,290
the words

243
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,219
a the end product industry up the
integrated circuit is

244
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,290
was the one trillion dollars couple
years but actually it would see that

245
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,430
now heading on with them new job done a
little earlier

246
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,510
put more effort and is going on his day
off

247
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,390
summer 1958 when he joined the Texas
Instruments

248
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,000
yeah it's a public transit

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
like so many russians true

250
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,899
bombing you 1969 to visit the year

251
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,899
okay but here's the the development of
the microprocessor

252
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,399
integrated chip integrated circuits are
microprocessors and amplifiers in

253
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,929
memory real microprocessors me we will
classifies as I say not as a show of the

254
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,649
season microprocessors its

255
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:01,899
classified memory and

256
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,040
time partnerships password place

257
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,779
yes like it is okay

258
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,109
1969 as hit the gym %uh

259
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:17,559
paul got a couple more missile yeah he
did one address a problem

260
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,049
lol anybody know the second I
microprocessor those with

261
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,669
before jumping on it initiators 1969 is
a

262
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:27,829
an intelligent years he was Ted Hoff
junior

263
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,910
and I he was assigned to the project is
for busy

264
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,868
opposition company that wanted marking
the first to top acting not exactly

265
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,449
pocket the servo

266
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:39,540
the standards that Daisy a pocket

267
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,549
and I see is a

268
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:47,819
most dedicated thank you but insert only

269
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:51,639
designed to serve what purpose soviet
stamp art I see you better

270
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,289
know you have you know million I didn't
see them using them to make it a

271
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:56,209
worthwhile

272
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,230
this guy today innovative approach

273
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,470
and we'll see the 8.0 visit comes as I
was too complicated and cumbersome to be

274
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,240
cost-effective sewing capably

275
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,019
alternative and serve a device act like
you charlie in green saree

276
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:15,199
on he thought to 3 the microprocessor
with the program

277
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,169
abilities it that product first its
limitations of my

278
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:22,339
late 1972 and this is the cannister

279
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,470
really like to talk about her our show I
want to go

280
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,059
the visit our calculated from a flea
market in

281
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,519
up was a grandfather Bronson Arroyo
Canada right up all night

282
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,559
travel all over the place the
committee's official drivers all the

283
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,519
country balls in

284
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,679
Miami no to look back and was babies

285
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,880
joining you know it's it's real tough it
excels

286
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,019
flea market find this doesn't mean that
the price is used to

287
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:50,549
join when you want to use but they're
obviously not

288
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:55,230
everybody's in in the Bay Area a
hologram is aware through

289
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,419
relative value obviously he's not
drinking

290
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,870
done with this crap it's just lines to
cancel it

291
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,610
what but that's all medical what it does
as well because medical

292
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:12,610
yes sir

293
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,169
I can't know

294
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,460
I can verify that we do you want to
discuss the

295
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,049
military applications are bothersome but
we still don't know

296
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,620
it's also shown mister so rather than
accepted

297
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,320
at face value we just go at it from the
consumer and wireless is very valuable

298
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,840
thank you thank you for that is there
was something that you miss

299
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,959
without you do it appreciate it well

300
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,760
1907 will pick up with it 4,004

301
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,330
chip and no was the pitcher he's not
busy come

302
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,139
calculated that we think that the flea
market was initially flea market was a

303
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:09,490
literati multiaxial and

304
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,360
this lady whom every issue he's walking
around the house boat

305
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,139
all we weren't as close to three times
Israel the plaza

306
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:21,380
atari in television also vintage video

307
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,070
insistence that theory garage to we saw
him

308
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,460
different times a day he's always in a
houseboat owners LeMans

309
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,500
modest decisiveness they do things that

310
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,600
but in Brunswick Georgia level itself
there so

311
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,539
another room I will hospital well

312
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,570
this guy who was a visitarme first to

313
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,918
that use the four thousand for chip to:
Texas Instruments

314
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,250
so early in they follow their character
their first as though the one seen right

315
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,570
there with the limited to: to $1,500

316
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,820
that used to ship that they don't and
subsequently became the a problem

317
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,429
yes as opposed to why these chips 19 the
seventies

318
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,090
think 200 million sold only two dollars
a piece that broke the year

319
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,870
Russ Berrie on anything and it was
account was released in early 1972

320
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,419
and

321
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,730
we saw those on eBay for other thirty or
forty dollars

322
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,330
it a bit of a bit somebody's got to be a
popular book probably list a

323
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,539
a little bit more up

324
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:28,289
doesn't look premium Sony keep resolve
it was shifted the

325
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:33,080
they don't know if that is the ATMs 1000
it's the chip that

326
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,580
it's also widely was used in the
handheld game so

327
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,730
the little professor david gardellin
going on you don't know

328
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,419
but yes the you %uh is used

329
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:52,239
microwave ovens my read under some other
applications for that shit

330
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,889
well few months after is a car first
Intel

331
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:59,239
for the design for that

332
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:02,899
4,004 ship I got another request

333
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:07,039
for you ship that have a little more
than for the fourth were a bit

334
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,100
microprocessor

335
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,239
could handle beer 1280 nobles

336
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:16,859
and the unit another develop was an
ordinary some courses of these

337
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,309
Michael processes its okay below the
eighty 08

338
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,480
the pizza healthy D Ted Hoff a couple
other guys get together

339
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,669
packed on this radioing to chip user
3300

340
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,830
transistors about 2,000 with his own the

341
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,649
4,000 yet for the absolute shit
executing

342
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:40,289
a whopping thirty thousand operations
tennis

343
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,990
other this chip how the first terminal
and our yes

344
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,279
I was like putting these terms and a if
you

345
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,700
but it would a larger department store
that had dedicated

346
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,450
terminals a computer models with a
limited amount of processing capability

347
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,210
on there was a chip that was a lot of
those are the ones in the

348
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:07,210
it said service merchandise political
mine you

349
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:13,370
%um I there is a plantation that I

350
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,669
than sorry can answer that I

351
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:21,210
don't have that in my notes here however
we arrived before 6:15

352
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,549
little more preparation it Texas
Instruments

353
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,620
both the first day company to

354
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,630
to really hit the the public interest

355
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,820
with the popular people gather around
stores

356
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,379
trying to hold the cell 1 I'm thoughts
one Marvel

357
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,649
unit just don't do it see that they were
going to release the palm pilots

358
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:49,090
you gain system who's excited feels it's
a more funky feeling you know

359
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,320
I'm

360
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,320
yeah I'm I agree with it but those most
engaging for its run

361
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,720
not on this is a nose job is but i think
is your game

362
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,450
junkie who you probably need to get a
latent

363
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,679
yeah just

364
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,970
me the hot

365
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,039
I V a quintessential owner the New

366
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,489
so many as 30,000 digital watches you
know

367
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:38,109
I need to be rich I E community yeah

368
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:43,389
unfortunately I gets done so caught up
in his opening to three hundred dollars

369
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:47,739
some other watches you can see you just
ahead on the collection Kassian Troyer

370
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:52,179
on but a picture votes Casio watches on
display here

371
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,440
%uh cassie is wrong 1976 I

372
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,899
introduced to watch that always eluded
me and I saw Tony

373
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,139
that new national model for so

374
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:07,309
the LCD watch collection fortunes
approach to pricing

375
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:10,918
room traditional mechanical watch
collections she's

376
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,639
it didn't start out that way and
supplies to looking was a kid

377
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:19,100
30 40 years old 1980 by your we remember
watching porno

378
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,119
I'll see you know you options were sold
initially surprised

379
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,779
expect individual 153 dollars to an

380
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:30,700
making some important five for a awash
in 1120

381
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,249
for how's it doesn't seem as 1,000
should hold up for it i think is risen

382
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:42,249
this guy's roaming around a few sessions
ya know our friend of mine yes

383
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,870
facility to a ticket or you know this
matured

384
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:59,870
I

385
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,920
oh you're going often slow rules only
yeah obviously

386
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,920
TT

387
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:26,150
mine

388
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,620
well he is a she who it is

389
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,780
probably the conclusion will get to you
couple minutes

390
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,970
innovation his lackluster she'll

391
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,320
its is due to vote in the channel in
just a couple other areas

392
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,389
pocketbook a few minutes I there's a

393
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,440
much larger group of companies that were
didn't run over the field

394
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,470
leading products at the time as far as

395
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:55,909
yet bashful getting Settlers of Catan K

396
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:59,820
the will have a samples at the unocal to
watch

397
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,270
kid the team's all-time history still
accountable

398
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:08,260
are Jenny thinking simpler as it needs a
wrist radios

399
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,789
so far this year clothing %uh kids any
the

400
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:15,570
computer lava computer it's also Tinkler

401
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,590
years the so I was he a processor

402
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,870
yeah and sewing kit

403
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,520
want to run for a seat on a bus and
number a long solo

404
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,668
it becomes a lot of UK and here yes 2010

405
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:40,669
always love their terminals time

406
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,470
of a hollow force even if they want to
only

407
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:54,470
so I don't know ever hacking can't
believe on your store

408
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,090
with it he referred to was it the LCD
wanna be only

409
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:09,090
okay

410
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:28,769
no

411
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:53,810
me

412
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,080
it's a

413
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,080
me

414
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,990
and debts

415
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,430
I'm was a 20-inch market when easy is
the more difficult for me to leave the

416
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:20,950
city

417
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:27,950
me well Ancelotti with the singer so
made it was but they were

418
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,950
course very susceptible to stay more
issues

419
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,450
so-and-so although he is how I mean
prior to write it like that

420
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,610
passed around and I was

421
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,840
it well

422
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,870
again is a this drug is a home this
johnson's full time

423
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,799
ball he says more credible well

424
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,139
looking at home or other global

425
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,590
professional wrestler General Electric
and any booze for GE

426
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,170
room no description guess him well
that's a numbers game

427
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,970
any up I wanted to chill the catalytic
brunette

428
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,640
should is a week and it's on like they
have our

429
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,950
radio show I know tonight mostly
cerebral

430
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,220
guys into the sea want to know but said

431
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,330
if you remember this is about 1977 don't
harm

432
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,010
at the here every team goes down Dawn
Part

433
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,129
want to do through the size 69

434
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:34,480
brother does Nazi don't use it was too
soon to be ex who Eva 54 reducing bills

435
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,419
dollar taking a times a day you know
through

436
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:41,860
Google's deal be upset he's an idiot

437
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:48,860
the hacking backup by thank you

438
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,860
and others that followed by Bossa

439
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,860
our they were periodicals other room

440
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,470
publicized other electronics to I have
the capital Beijing

441
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:07,470
games with calculators nichols et said

442
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,020
right

443
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,050
no in the who pioneered the a constant

444
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:26,310
I lose Casio thing at the lease the
easiest to look

445
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,899
to use the classes features yeah they
were in the rock world capitalism

446
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,160
yields but the Cassie hitting you know

447
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,460
sign he twice you put it past him

448
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,930
them member others for you missus room
has lotsa

449
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:48,930
1200 us

450
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,059
movies absolutely right again you can
rate is for his next year

451
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:23,020
it I sell it to the organization
Angelina

452
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,460
the these two took a active Roland

453
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:32,580
standardized a on there was a problem my
process you

454
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,730
several years ago the Ronnie Brown which
only a handful

455
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,350
you know messages well

456
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,480
malls and talk about it there we
selected II will enable

457
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,940
to get it for those those just not into
that are

458
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,620
that we feel that penalizing you for
that

459
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,700
goes along with the seventies and
eighties no talking show

460
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,299
should depart from a and although user

461
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:01,899
calculators tell us what I suppose all
other

462
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:07,830
we have a anyway I was I was actually an
hour's

463
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:14,830
layer was actually the rockwell ps4

464
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,860
by %uh this this particular on you know
game was the

465
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,590
certainly one of the first if you
consider TI's a little professor

466
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,110
an OK I was released in early 1976

467
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,800
%uh tells football on was released

468
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,300
later that year and I implemented

469
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,100
the second run was a second
microprocessor on

470
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,280
soul was a rockwell's opps for

471
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,389
whose least and was announced the same

472
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,600
the same here as Intel's for you for

473
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,730
released year or so later and

474
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,020
it's also corporate orbit on
microprocessor

475
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:04,389
and I practice 10 Pinterest show
something inside Syria fancy

476
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,910
touch-sensitive contact them at all
putting

477
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:12,120
pretty well well-thought-out game for
for the year whilst raising his suit and

478
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,630
I know that this gentleman here said he
pleaded for hours and hours as well

479
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:19,720
those are the hardest really take it you
know from you plaything for five years

480
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,309
without appalachia the controller

481
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:27,410
I love these things in person long to
respond I think the bodies thing was a

482
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,440
I recall my green light i think im
running

483
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:37,440
hardly ever 0

484
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,680
alright

485
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,350
we agree that that it's a little bit
more his own

486
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,880
mark what is a and he was made in navy
seals anyways

487
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,420
my oppose it 20 bucks from I've seen
some of these Gophers hi

488
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,080
is 67 alt original box yeah but you can
see right knee

489
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,680
the here that's be that's the good news
for undone

490
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,940
for a reason why it it is so low with
handheld games

491
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,149
head features for teaching contacts
which

492
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,730
up brocco claim including

493
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,340
enhanced through improved fellows and I
suppose

494
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,440
me here for

495
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,450

see you can see me

497
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:36,310
pre-operative enjoy

498
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,899
the

499
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,549
we have you to 20

500
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:45,079
only displays we have over 100 one on
the bottom

501
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,809
shit lol of America we explained

502
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:51,970
wonder if that split small

503
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,990
but there's you indicate the

504
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:01,970
guys on the field on the other hand the
upper right hand corner you have

505
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,990
little speaker for a

506
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:10,410
and but it's pretty simple design the

507
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,490
tells a those games incredibly well

508
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,930
and its only lead to a problem in hello

509
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,430
and no games are those people or other
line

510
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,020
arcade games and on

511
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,150
video game consoles and

512
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,579
glory think is it a game is no available

513
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:34,430
read reform in Walmart came out the
protesters

514
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,440
you to retailers rose 15 boats they use
the same dive into cutting it

515
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,880
the chassis area and but instead uses a
cheaper

516
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,290
LCD display do you think the pullback in
the factual data

517
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,670
original miss playing I want to crack
the

518
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,640
for yeshiva think we all know that the
least another

519
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,770

catch up through the books the memories

520
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,359
I love

521
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:05,819
better than talking I think those images
for the best I think the only

522
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:09,170
the abilities on the new one are the
than the traditional more

523
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,510
traditional round LED lights rallies in
DC now not the

524
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,250
