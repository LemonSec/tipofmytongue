1
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,740
ok

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,510
hole

3
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,570
months

4
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,090
yes any here's said

5
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,210
you world

6
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,150
and

7
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,489
yes

8
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:59,980
well K stars this

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,860
along with awesome mind

10
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,510
them lose

11
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,570
in the world

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,570
old

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,720
a

14
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,200
hit

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,200
day

16
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:55,710
yeah

17
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,500
take home the one Obama called

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,130
conspiracy home over the weekend

19
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,460
go too much into the conspiracy serve

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,640
bill Burnham to your organizations and
things like that

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,370
has to have a technological toy store
which usually is most conspiracy still

22
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,860
so toughening the rules

23
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,709
weather control a hill slower

24
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,410
muscle from me but the UN leaving
mention we're going to some other

25
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,160
treaties

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,140
so %uh just before the game

27
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,400
this is only %uh defensible alone

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,920
nothing is set in stone stars

29
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,170
but people told me correspondence things
are right on the United

30
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,769
his loss so

31
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,980
if you're looking good this no that's on
you on

32
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,018
most love the research I have done

33
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,720
botany will home right a day

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,519
Bonnie profession he said she is for you
analyst

35
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,230
this is going back in in the late
eighteen hundreds

36
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,060
early 1900s were but he had left germany

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,620
over fears of being his Austrian a he
moved to America 1939

38
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,670
it as he had continued to do so
experience he found

39
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,810
I'll blue-green globules

40
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,079
there are being released by the team
food

41
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,720
and he described it as some form
biological the server

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,470
and he are moving into bonds

43
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,120
was chris conway H term team Bastian

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,540
was open to burglary server so

45
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,000
don't through does experiments he has
found

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,299
ok this is write-downs his eyes were
burning

47
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,609
possible the gender violence along
Wilson came the skin

48
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,859
to china number who is a shield to
protect

49
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:59,530
even contain my lines in nineteen forty

50
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,670
work to build his first accumulator
which was

51
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,180
a six-sided boss he was immensely was
organic and inorganic substances

52
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,209
such as glass will still on government
Xiong

53
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,160
in from the birds were actually hunt in
financial litigation

54
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,159
positing enjoy the highest solo here

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,430
found on with most any financial
tensions flow from higher to lower

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,240
was or how long it was reverse
managed-care

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,169
just working sperling any came up with
the idea that we're gonna using

58
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,940
so on 1941

59
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,250
he does so far he knows our own song

60
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,320
much want to see is it to hook up soon

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,540
need de salud bustle of

62
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,330
leniency it wasn't that important so

63
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,990
looking for a meeting on and breaks for
the Oregon Institute

64
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,600
running and was the river cruising
experience

65
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,400
do was over her head in the 1951

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
publication the order number experiment
so

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,590
while he was out there doing his expense

68
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,060
he had shrubs and trees hedge fund want
to live

69
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,810
in there was also allegedly dormancy

70
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,800
files a world both poem love

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,039
sold when he had discussing both close
he billed

72
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,030
what he called clotbuster and it was a
series of shit aluminum pipes

73
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,680
in 20 different blends the shuttle
platform

74
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,360
into teams local cable go to waters
points on

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,190
analysts believe that things could be
formed to disperse from

76
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,910
personal I don't see how it could be
that simple

77
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,060
but im a diesel motorhome

78
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,220
so those polls close early

79
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,270
it varied home you know that was the
size of the closing Sydney

80
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,219
and he said he had me go to a hundred
pasta lovers

81
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,560
mother fucker love the atmosphere but
also be controlled insurance operations

82
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,820
so slow almost home he'd been publishing

83
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,099
researching everything and motorhomes
acquired

84
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,690
normally don't you know some

85
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,190
not your initial or but then on GPS

86
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,330
enjoy it with 1950s s the FDA show

87
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,659
at his place in the streets accumulators
essence to

88
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,100
in the burned his books as well so your
way to

89
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,380
girl had time in jail because

90
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,020
does a court injunction from his home
for him having

91
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,080
all these devices is a few years he was
solemn

92
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,990
which initially all he did was early
prostate long

93
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,490
sold when he had time to

94
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,470
his village when he gets lost books and
papers back but the only thing is still

95
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,630
holding on to them

96
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,870
and to this day there was sitting in Ft
involving the misuse release

97
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,630
so in 1999

98
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,870
do was you lost me Michael mean

99
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,910
and yet when the book whole project mein
Schiff and

100
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,030
I'll a letter that he had said not the
question arose

101
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,230
was heading home at the time 1946
solution for some who eventually brought

102
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,139
the intention

103
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,030
at the federal level to the point to do
actually begin an investigation

104
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,000
the hearings today one of the things was
an article by a freelance journalist

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,940
military E Brady as she posed nude in
public

106
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,600
Times Co strange case a lil homie and

107
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,460
she meant to say down days ago

108
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,169
she's on the way home for the seat
intervene against because he was a quote

109
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,799
post quack and those will be something
was amiss

110
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,889
Robinho so use the old

111
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,570
units has been with me

112
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,110
sweeney do you know this is going to
give me just a little

113
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,440
still so some home

114
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,690
her friends you want for this is the
irradiated

115
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,110
for so according to

116
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,840
general already sold former army chief
said

117
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,100
it says we use technology to 21st
century will be able to see any weekday

118
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,770
only

119
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,010
anywho go after him relentlessly

120
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,620
so slowly along with modification
capability will take for the Moors

121
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,110
however small to Lowes

122
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,440
so since then it was a drafty in 1977
the UN General Assembly

123
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,350
adopted Resolution prohibiting the
hostilities Omar home modification

124
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,579
techniques

125
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:54,050
the resulting conventional the
prohibition loans hurry

126
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,920
or any other possible use formal
notification to me

127
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,790
or online had committed even some Tories

128
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,769
to refrain from any military or also use
a loan modification

129
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,149
which was always for those secure fax

130
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,829
which it didn't feel social affairs

131
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:16,060
said israel's Monday he

132
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,470
we had last week the dryness people it
was all experiencing

133
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,220
wellesley needed if you're going ahead
with this

134
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,029
the wheels

135
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,550
so as a look further into this in my

136
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,040
infomercial its he's not really a lot

137
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,069
to with this will be misusing range of
money

138
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,800
in our little one it's a each state
party to this convention

139
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,110
takes need to engage in military ruler
possible use

140
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,209
learning techniques having widespread
long-missing

141
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,850
person you fix is needed disruption
initial injury to any other state

142
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,300
party each deeper into this convention

143
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,970
takes not to assist encourage oldies in
steel

144
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,029
groove States or international
organization

145
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,850
to engage in activities conjures visions
of her clothes are all

146
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,389
so Dr who this is

147
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:22,100
no reveals much hillbilly weather
control techniques we know the

148
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,570
they are widespread in long lines

149
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,270
so then leading toward till it says

150
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,560
time are a lot of cooking techniques the
first

151
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,850
any technical changes deliver
manipulation

152
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,500
natural processes dynamics composition

153
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,560
instructional videos including its
biosphere

154
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,100
or other space so once again then head
over heels

155
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,440
I think I just told you long after using
technology

156
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,270
to do that we'll be using such in those
words

157
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,390
what by who was fear well

158
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,360
so you will see the jet stream can be
manipulated as well

159
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,930
which if you looking to the physics time
is it for beating

160
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,490
doesn't permit me to go to it now but if
you go into the physics behind it

161
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,339
King seriously for to other

162
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,680
so they had also said know this means

163
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,010
who had worked on this is the one
scientists

164
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,110
but also said that they can also change
compositional structure the earth

165
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,190
normal much in the way of the engineer

166
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,580
but this is not doing it was quoted at
some point

167
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,600
new simulation people's on looking to do

168
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,839
that they would actually use a term like
that

169
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,020
so ranging from of the weather changes
from the farm was being cited

170
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,520
virtually nationwide I am in the world

171
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,660
strong Georgia polls

172
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,399
being detected by the offering world
indomitable images from

173
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,490
the Soho spacecraft visual observations

174
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,959
lows going to be found or something
going on

175
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,810
well and it was one using a little when
this happened as well

176
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,070
on july is so there was a freak
snowstorm in central jerusalem

177
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,459
but at the same time and messes

178
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:24,500
young people's all of that was detected
by Alfred

179
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,760
you so locally known

180
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,029
need to Shane Diesel this

181
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:37,820
so fields

182
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:44,820
really 10 greater officials home

183
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,640
room

184
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:01,489
well of all

discussion Pocono I have to

187
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,410
pictures here just walking will it was
actually a short film

188
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,910
where he had gone each

189
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,579
that was in South Dakota but the whole
grains 206

190
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,980
room time with was actually with a blast

191
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,629
from where the in q1 of you

192
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:33,790

DNA using us we are removed from the
Google

207

384
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,760
national news service we are centuries
and

385
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,500
news children's playground publications
around the country

386
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,660
are which lenses you should be

387
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,340
are draws Harborside become very very
concerned

388
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,350
about the agree with this information
that you've been given

389
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,370
up to this point both technologically in
the area intelligence

390
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,540
I am longer in nature

391
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,389
this meeting is extremely hopeful you or

392
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,640
so long as brothers people this country
processes

393
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,710
many ways you or the whole love this
country

394
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,300
however all I do feel

395
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,460
them much with the direction over
attention

396
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,690
misdirected now I think possible
deliberately

397
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,120
I think it's time to make some homes on
this

398
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,580
for school are heard

399
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,860
many speeches on the road brunch the

400
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,920
I usually technology include for
increasing

401
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,970
social control of bird

402
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,290
a lot about the new show how computer
systems were

403
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,100
that although growth what you need to do
however

404
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,350
and your efforts to save gore or
Williams

405
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,980
will be ineffective on lushgroove
understand a few basic things

406
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,660
for school stop focusing on

407
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,620
the structure the Internet the new show
how computers work for all that whole

408
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,190
thing

409
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,900
that's great to do the first thing you
need to do

410
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,680
a newly infected without doing this is
focus on

411
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,710
where the waters at home wrong more

412
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,710
any good political analyst

413
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,950
any good political story will tell you
one thing

you folks we live in a in the time up
information wars

580
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,840
each and every time you turn your

581
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,790
security

582
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,230
of course people here already know about
the author

583
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,560
okay so we won't have to later on those

586
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,470
what you're elected public officials

okay will deal with issues that

588
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,260
easy to explain things like whether
control

589
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,390
you know low technology

590
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,240
Tesla he's the lone as the loam
technology

591
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,790
you know weather modification it does
exist

592
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,440
has for many many many years

593
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,710
a public access this item information

594
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,840
suppress while

595
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,870
we don't want you to know why we lost
the family farm we want you to know I

596
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,480
drought has been around for three years
knowing me knowing you

597
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,590
you might catch on

598
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:46,960
the people the United States is the most
regulated in the world

599
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,180
the cost of freedom is constant
vigilance

600
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,560
have you paid your dues once each and
every one you ready to do

601
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,660
to maintain your freedom what are you
willing to give up

602
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,149
remember evil flourishes when good men
do nothing

603
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:13,720
and ladies by the way okay

604
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,420

differences

605
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,880
where black americans why American
Spanish america's try

606
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,460
Americans because divided we r easily
controlled

607
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,550
we all must maintain a common goal

608
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,890
common goal freedom

609
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,359
you many more will be regulated very
very soon

610
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,940
okay as you watch the parameters have
your freedom now

611
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:48,370
on the Internet you will see legislation
always put you in the same way

612
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,049

623
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,280
major issues and technological aspects
of

624
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,670
major issues and

625
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,600

00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:07,229
energy medicine raining on us

867
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:34,900

00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,630
northern are go home

869
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,650
possible very briefly did too connect
the dots holy from whether

870
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:48,439
controls the last four freedoms of it
that it is actually easy

871
00:57:48,439 --> 00:57:52,049
I he studied the Communist Manifesto

872
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:56,479
rated they've got to find a way of
eliminating all the personal possessions

873
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,609
and property rights to the people in the
United States

874
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,828
now the lodges tracts of land this

875
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:07,569
United States should be held by farmers
for the most part okay

876
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:10,900
so if you can through economic terrorism
in the use

877
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,479
weather control I didn't go far the
weather patrol outside

878
00:58:14,479 --> 00:58:18,099
I tried to use a very broad brush keep
everybody interest

879
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:25,099
are but I'll give you an example you
have two things happening in a culture

880
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:30,799
you have farm subsidy okay where they
have appointed diminishing

881
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:36,009
retired we have it land taxes catch up
with the subsidy and then

882
00:58:36,009 --> 00:58:40,059
that's the first step to losing your
property when you accept the

883
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:41,539
government's money for anything

884
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:44,599
they have control over this shit okay

885
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,449
you signed the account rather cohesion
that they are not going to

886
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:51,769
have a contractual agreement that you're
not gonna grow cross

887
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:56,589
and going into the sunset right now and
say no I was a soundbar

888
00:58:56,589 --> 00:58:59,739
when you go two years into the fall
problem the property

889
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:04,650
goes back to stay room okay so you see
los trastes

890
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:09,059

917
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,789
costing carcinogen and a

918
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:49,420
it's being lived there for a reason to
weaken the immune system

919
