1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:03,530
when

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,640
no grab the camera over there posing for
me

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,929
with a patent buddy the

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,380
which is make this clear game because
you get a guy to hear that from his lane

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,059
boo boo use open-source boom

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,949
what your fellow people here at the core
install the power supply to my laptop

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,699
which do you use that on like eight
years without the battery is dead

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,619
and I had to put this together at the
last minute so that's the view this

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:28,240
lecture

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,710
so as I said before got marketing

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,930
users here but not be is the one who

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,500
Center recovered means okay

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,460
mom I

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,719
bend over for the entire time okay well
first off thank you all for coming

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,800
by if I seem a little not quite what
usually happens because I had to I was

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,940
asleep for the past four days each day

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,250
in order to the contest is a DJ will and
does is my last game before getting some

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,899
sleep some food may be low over the city
in my life

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,130
Zola there with me our minds don't shine

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,770
also knows the entropy technician a what
we'll be doing is giving the talk here

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,548
are a hero to devise

22
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,580
I have the have a working model devices
named

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,798
the spire dogs and this has to do with
proximity card

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,049
identification security systems mostly

25
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,759
is alleged physical security but also in
data security as well

26
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,900
%uh the first or the Banshee is that
this is Oliver

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,119
large community all those people out
here and the first thing I want to say

28
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,409
is I did not do this on my own

29
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,710
are lot of other members of the hacker
community and help me

30
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,020
with their advise their ideas and I love
think a lot of them

31
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,439
most specifically RROD whose beheaded
security this week

32
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,130
i has been really helpful would be
helping me find some obscure hardware

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,589
endings twist their arm his newspaper
with these days and then they go boom

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,880
and I've work my way through a lot of
parts

35
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,549
to get as far as I have also are the CDC

36
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,930
that was the CDC and magistrate force
also gives invaluable help as well as

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,099
303 so why would my 303 people out there
we watch this on the net later on

38
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:23,109
only clear that experience without
possibly garth before

39
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,209
I S that's easy

40
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,709
hours he originally the original
versions bought soda water right down

41
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,530
the middle. the road your region cards
into the temple mount room over the

42
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,190
ideal result we didn't hear

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,340
that's not going to happen things to the
unfavorable market economy was able to

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,970
get the white

45
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,090
widely-read you have a solid lol
obligate looking into technical about

46
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,640
the cards but i wanna get a quick
overview what i'm talking about. wanna

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,250
talk about the spider bart's

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,640
our first of all what is it its device
that the theoretically closed-door

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,930
recall generator quite simple to operate
possibly based

50
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,010
bad security system works now

51
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,109
that right there are a lot of people
read that and they said well that's it

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,970
that stuff

53
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,480
well what are you doing what i say.
theoretically the reason I say that is

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,170
because

55
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,190
I have not built the device while
they're not got the virus

56
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,859
because I have no urgent need to be the
star next week's edition applause

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,970
the the concept is this

58
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,290
possibly cards are used widely for
physical security

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,810
rien well as he worries even see them in
your offices

60
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,269
you see the in businesses there's some
housing developments that uses

61
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:38,909
hasn't brought you to use it our lives
and Bob larger facilities here say the

62
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,030
word

63
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,140
that use them are really basis

64
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,849
and while this is true is the radical as
you'll find out the

65
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,629
the theory is very solid now

66
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:54,018
the one thing that people asking a lot
this weekend is where did this name come

67
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,090
from where to look at the spider Veloce

68
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,420
on associative mine is a great artist
and he's involved in a project called

69
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,879
trades metropolitan

70
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,280
a few my chance but you know the upset
the

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,580
the episodes beginning the issue with
spiders first going after the smiler

72
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,139
and he says you know fire it up you know
give me fire give me slow

73
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,340
give me information it when is this is
this is how you want to follow a

74
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,150
all this information he is quoted as
saying

75
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,210
I have devices in ninety-eight percent
in security companies around the world

76
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,258
have no idea about

77
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:34,300
and no one is really thought of it this
way I talk to a lot of people you would

78
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,490
possibly systems

79
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,590
and no one is ever really is up there
and said that we did

80
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,600
know how we have this said me how I came
to that conclusion

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,540
are wonderful market economy led to a
series in laos a

82
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,410
I love my former employers and one day I
was

83
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,190
sysadmin and the next day I was sysadmin

84
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,340
programmer for the PBS security person

85
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,229
and mom boy yes

86
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,460
I had she pushed loss as well as bits is
kinda scary pitcher

87
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,289
so also upon this is Lamar intro to see
how it works because that's where it

88
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:10,889
comes from

89
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,880
anything he bought you when you were a
kid way around said he'll head that has

90
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,169
a TV work he has been driver RRR

91
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:22,169
only got back from the army said you
know case on that never do that again

92
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:28,198
cool high school is a little different I
grew up in a very rural community in the

93
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,770
old causes the technology happens but
also the guy

94
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,320
raised to run by the telephone guy with
bottles working re do it all over again

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,490
so that's where our that's working from

96
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,650
at that is where they came from old
stuff

97
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,639
okay the facility is talk about a
possibly card

98
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,380
is all a lot of people he have possibly
got on the board after 2nd take a look

99
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,630
at it

100
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,969
you'll see it's a really small thin
piece of plastic

101
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,680
so you may see two morrow runs where
that's at two pieces that are glued

102
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,580
together

103
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,810
is with you may see a single he's one
which is on the newer ones

104
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,360
to their sweetness parts to possibly car

105
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,009
the transponder the into a protective
coating protective coatings which are

106
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,780
holding on to you right now

107
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,370
that coating protects the oil from being
damaged also means that he would do the

108
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,039
laundry accidentally will get destroyed

109
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,099
get a is actually inside it and what I
half years approximately car that I

110
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,860
dissected

111
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,430
and they will tell you you cannot do
this and we're holding here's proof that

112
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,860
in fact you can not only does it the
proximity card you can also write you a

113
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,740
letter to Kinkos

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,430
now that's not to say that you don't
have a few

115
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,560
mistakes made in the process but this
proximity card is mangled as it is does

116
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,949
still work

117
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:52,849
but this is the insider the proxy card I
know it's hard to see

118
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,960
and if you like a close look at it these
plot where are more than happy to show

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,060
it to you

120
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,860
the ER the transponder is this little
black

121
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,960
piece right here you can barely see it
it's actually a small chip

122
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,160
in close is very nasty plastic if you
try to load the bus

123
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,099
chip the plastic you will destroy the
car also the antennae is the right here

124
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:19,530
is actually a single-stranded while
wrapped around and around and around and

125
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,789
around and around

126
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,759
any great anywhere in that wire whether
the car useless

127
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,139
and how do I know this will

128
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:34,400
let's just say I had a a few setbacks
early on

129
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,240
so that's the basics up the car itself

130
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,410
other colleges are write once read many
times

131
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,379
what that means is that the information
stored on this party burned into it at

132
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,949
the time other than section

133
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,280
is she weighs doing this the first we do
is you pre buy them

134
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,180
in a box if they come pre-loaded for he
pay off the lows for

135
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,949
or you can spend two days with a bunch
of lawyers and DA's dance where a viable

136
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,169
and they will give you a devise

137
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,370
that will allow you to program playing
cards even by playing cards making

138
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,150
yourself as you need them

139
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,520
one thing about this device though is
that it's he needs very heavily

140
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,940
when you get that involves after you
signed your life away you get a CD-rom

141
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,750
a physical he and the right device all
three of those devices are made to each

142
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,210
other and definitely

143
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,400
that CD rom that meter that car

144
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,669
it cannot be used anywhere else and it's
one that you have to go through a lot of

145
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,890
hoops to get on with these are the only
laid my eyes on

146
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,370
love them and dimes is a scary process

147
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,409
was the information is broadening your
though that said

148
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,610
ad infinitum and they say that the cars
have a life

149
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,870
love what are the two hundred thousand
reads

150
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,870
I've never seen this live that far the
you get destroyed ripped apart or what

151
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,000
have you

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
and when you see this car he is loose
it's it's all fairly simple to go from

153
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,660
the regular

154
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,689
from work are you have your head this in
order to dissect love these

155
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,880
it takes very special

156
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,399
me school that is very very difficult to
find

157
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,850
energy go across the street to the drug
store you can buy it for about a dollar

158
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,709
fifteen it's called as a tow

159
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,810
those who used to live at home with him
on his fingernail polish remover go

160
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,330
ahead and use it

161
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,190
Guinea is though be very careful what I
say

162
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,730
in Israel I say that is the same he says
that makes it stick to the front

163
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,980
apart like this is also in bed in the
corals

164
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,050
so if you leave it in there too long
what it actually does

165
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,610
is the quote comes upon also don't use
the extra strength he's the classic

166
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:48,310
the card itself that's so that's pretty
much delay the lead on the cards

167
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,190
are to cover this pretty well now how
these cards were

168
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,040
what happens is the reader a little bit
with the red light on it

169
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,149
will lead RF signal normally this is

170
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,279
ok as a lawyer a lot of different
standards are a lot of the protocol

171
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,019
sales rose has its perks and listing
with the standard that I've used

172
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,810
his $825 to hurt says on the bag is at
Rs 80

173
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,450
wanna excites the car life the antenna
grabs the energy put it back in the year

174
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,230
it spits out the ID information for your
card

175
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,529
once it does that we chase with the
information that a long

176
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:30,529
into the security system for
verification and authentication

177
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,940
okay

178
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,519
know a basic proximity system a security
system

179
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,709
not just the car is composed of issues
very simple pieces

180
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,630
are such a computer which not only holds
the database information does all the

181
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,769
comparisons approvals in this approvals

182
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,019
panels readers and you're locking
devices

183
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,149
panel in a reader I actually two
different devices on the city we think

184
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:56,850
they're one

185
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,610
there are exceptions to this rule the
our readers that act as panels

186
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,339
but for the most part you will have a PC

187
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,240
a central panel digital you seals or
squat gray boxes

188
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,490
the individual readers I'm even believe
I have a diagram here for you

189
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,720
there you go now this is just a really
quick and dirty diagram and how it works

190
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,279
the really see right here's what you see
your door that remembers a cartoon

191
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,990
that's how you tell who you are

192
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,079
the locking devices the device that
actually keeps the

193
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:34,490
your door or your access point lot these
varied from physical oxidant built into

194
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,380
the helpful to those made 300 volt
magnets you see all the time yet to try

195
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,700
and pull in political

196
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,790
I see a funny story about those those
systems

197
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,160
are very secure those less
electromagnets 50 things you have to

198
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,740
consider

199
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,790
number one is power loss in which you

200
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,849
is this not install correctly our
company's name will remain what it was

201
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,920
since they way under

202
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,020
had one does miss installed in only one
let it was

203
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,449
energized he you walk up to it as you
lace and bows double the handling

204
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,959
income right open also a lot of the
magnetic door locks don't catch

205
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,730
your address or or buzzing noises Barton
back and forth

206
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,440
or as i've seen in my history without
physical security audits

207
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,690
you can get a day's big fat piece a
cardboard

208
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,649
the is useless so either

209
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:27,020
are what happens is the reader charges
the panel that you come up when you

210
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,000
present your car

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,040
to the reader you'll hear the know what
happens is the real so that information

212
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,160
to the panel

213
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,180
that had a look at your cart ID number:
and compare it against a database is

214
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,269
built inside it

215
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,279
which includes your ID number what her
day with a week

216
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,370
UK you can or cannot access and we'll
make

217
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,800
accept or reject decision either way

218
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,430
to the panel which one the information
back to the cycle computer

219
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,420
let's have a computer all recorded
either that a his car was used

220
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,949
be it was accepted or rejected what time

221
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:05,520
and so on a more advanced systems the
central computer will also

222
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,910
hole up for more information for you and
displayed on a terminal at the security

223
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,850
access point

224
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,970
I'll get to that in a bit the one thing
you remember those the simple computer

225
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,199
does not do you

226
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,140
in those cases any decision making is
simply there for database

227
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,420
interface little person goes into the
system

228
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,490
the actually the information is input
here but it sent to the individual

229
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,230
handles

230
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,399
as a and the resync after every time do
this

231
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,449
is that more reason for doing this if
for some reason

232
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:37,920
the central computer goes down or is

233
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,160
I it will not affect the system

234
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,089
it will not affect the system at all
this is will still work perfectly normal

235
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,420
I've done a lot across testing with this
and

236
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,399
the panels will continue to run so long
as they have some formal powers with a

237
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,610
good as you run a lot

238
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,940
all the 14 goals BC if need be and

239
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,890
the are so silly me you okay had also
disable the related locking device

240
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,529
videos program

241
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:09,140
it will stay open for 5-10 seconds it
will open the garage door it'll raise a

242
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,660
little barrier what have you

243
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,339
the systems are not limited to doors
they

244
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,160
are adaptable their deductible to you
anything from a garage door repair your

245
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,760
a are passed through any such device

246
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,250
working on all talk about a little later
though the heel his heel

247
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,360
this is that people don't always program
it correctly

248
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,779
he would not always take the time to do
things correctly

249
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,920
and a lot of times past backs are not
checked illegal entries are not checked

250
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,880
if you force the door open the battle
will recognize the door is open only to

251
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
log entry but if you don't look

252
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,110
will never know and that is one major
flaw

253
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,360
but its with their used to that so

254
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,980
are hard to get into the system rolling
users and rolled

255
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,380
it is either the pulitzer to the panel
your badge is printed

256
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,449
sometimes you'll see that ages they have

257
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,010
are suffering too low similar to this
one right here

258
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,490
this one has a esta fotografía me on it
and company logo

259
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,230
and take a look at it a good look at
this that your security guard

260
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,199
you can see how that the party is on
here because the name that's on the car

261
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,740
that's aside the boy you see is legit
proximity card

262
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,990
and this photograph on it and says

263
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,500
operations manager as a vessel company
logo is your

264
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,559
Joe security guard he saw that would you
say yes or no

265
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,240
lets you hands he has

266
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,279
yes congratulations you're just lost
your jobs this is one of the process

267
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:41,930
faking

268
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,170
the system and that is a Photoshop 11:08
a.m.

269
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,180
block love high glossy photograph paper
this also

270
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,720
passes for a second I D people say your
work ID

271
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,949
sure by me is Arthur Phillip Bell showed

272
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:01,939
operations manager for a junichi in hell

273
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:06,839
a you know I'm really I get upstairs we
just had a PGP explosion these bits all

274
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:07,730
over the floor

275
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,470
really gotta get up there you know the
boss gets on the mic got me

276
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,980
but there's a lot of shots all over the
floor so he's got a clue the mall

277
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,000
certainly me ego of school social
engineering

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,540
but I'll don't feel that he has certain
people

279
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,130
a certain a heat security checkpoint
before by these equally as well

280
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,220
she had a batch by the way if you want
to the gym it biatch

281
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,290
if you wanna bet that is not Photoshop
how many you have two hundred dollars to

282
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,610
spare

283
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,670
but E is for each day and that's good
enough for you

284
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,180
a entire security by Sheran systems can
be had for as little as two hundred

285
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,040
dollars on e-bay

286
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,449
and various other places on the net so

287
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:55,480
others it's a little bit the security at
all he said

288
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,650
okay oh this is the partnership

289
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,250
okay cell a normal situation you
presents a car

290
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,380
the debt is right from the car is about
the panel access is granted track

291
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,919
session

292
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,829
transactions law cover that so what's
wrong with this picture

293
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,149
why is this a bad thing well first is
all

294
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,890
the reader is constantly a little what
that means is that 125 delivered signals

295
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,010
out there in the air all the time

296
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,699
it isn't here with my day nighter in
between that signals out there it's

297
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:26,290
always

298
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,320
ready to read no matter what

299
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,760
why this is bad I'll get to that and
you'll see the car will respond to any

300
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,050
device

301
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,428
it in the proper frequency if you come
up with the right signal

302
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,990
it doesn't care you couldn't make a
device

303
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,210
and despite iraq's is such a device

304
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,460
that will he met the appropriate
frequency and it doesn't have to be

305
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,030
called present because all it knows is

306
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,010
I'm getting a signal car was present
because nobody believes anything else

307
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,270
could possibly exist

308
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,908
is a one-way did it change what that
means is the carbamates

309
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,350
the reader reads ended story

310
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,280
6 day the hardest-hit state it happen

311
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,918
and yes no question well why would there
be encryption

312
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,190
even if you Korean quit how good could
it be

313
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,419
never changed he

314
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,610
once it's there in so why bother

315
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,679
so what about read/write cards really
like cards

316
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,720
do exist they're using vending machines
love yes

317
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,240
his photocopy shops and that's it

318
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,740
while I'm well they're expensive as hell

319
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,409
even the best systems right now there
are used in college campuses for money

320
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,890
exchange how it works is the heart holds
happened he

321
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,909
the reader halt after he the reader
takes the head of the key from the car

322
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:54,059
piece it together with its head the key
and decides okay

323
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:57,610
you're legitimate that it sends a signal
back to the car

324
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,040
which re edits the card any a committee
commence

325
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,950
your debit or credit on the card

326
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,750
again incredibly simple to hack if you
have the time luxury

327
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,070
so the phone line becomes money

328
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,149
its all about money it is cheaper to me

329
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:22,200
10,000 simple little cards like this

330
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,860
in May a hundred cards that our little
more

331
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,419
secure little more solid a little less
likely to happen also

332
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,780
legacy systems systems that are already
in existence in order to go to

333
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,510
read/write

334
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,389
it's a substantial amount of money not
because it's more expensive not this is

335
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:39,360
true here

336
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,490
but it's what I call the presidency of
fun

337
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,490
you have the capacity to charge acts
what I charge do acts were charged three

338
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,040
acts

339
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,080
when i charge for Accies of a new Lexus
while you're at it

340
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,870
as a lot of the thinking goes behind
since physical security systems

341
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,139
and it's scary in my opinion this row

342
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,820
years is this salt intake won't take to
spoof

343
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,120
approximately system well first of all
you gotta admit the problem

344
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,639
RF signal now how do you figure out the
RF signal

345
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,070
how'd he know what type you have Holly
type you do

346
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,428
well there's a tool you use to figure
out exactly how

347
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,520
he you got the frequency encoding

348
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,570
on proximity card it's a very
technologically advanced tool

349
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,908
in fact its is one of the most advanced
tools if it's cold right now

350
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:36,330
a its right on the committee edge
technology

351
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,470
this technology anybody have an idea
about who would be

352
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,100
Google

353
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,429
ninety percent the possibly car
companies publish what they call

354
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:53,200
Technical Notes on the Internet

355
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,919
including these technical notes are
little things like yes all it takes

356
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,240
expertise all slowly votes

357
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,340
and well either way the don't let it all
in she is such

358
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,629
are too busy this to get to that in over
if you want more information you going

359
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:09,290
to need to go to our special citing

360
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,290
which is only for our customers and
clients and you need your User ID and

361
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,870
Password

362
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,260
well password is testing

363
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,149
is the is are these tester

364
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:27,250
the end up with applications these will
tell you how to encode and decode the

365
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,639
information

366
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:32,149
all about the system also though

367
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:35,770
if you have a minute spell the name of
the company that makes these spots on

368
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,780
the cards

369
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,980
he great website without a hundred
addresses these are the kinds of

370
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,220
martinis

371
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,909
a and I gotta tell you

372
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:49,409
J it the cordial martini in the flying
Dutch a lifesaver

373
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,060
that I have to say I have today

374
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,600
one company in particular the Bombay
Sapphire gin company

375
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,840
because I drank so much bombay in the
process of developing

376
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,990
as it was supposed to this is then they
were real being held

377
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,030
in the process of developing missile
system so

378
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,060
%ah

379
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,790
that is not endorsed up their company or
do they endorse me I just want their

380
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,790
product they just take my money

381
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,918
so anyway what we have to do is we amid
the RF signal

382
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,820
we watching the response from the car
now we have the card information

383
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,720
we need a store that information and
down the road later we reach transmit

384
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,040
the information

385
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,120
the citizens only a string of digits

386
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,620
and I didn't cover that yet bad only the
former

387
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,090
other cars the most common form as the
one against Andrew as love you may

388
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,199
present we get why can't login

389
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,560
I think that's a lie again and for me
that's correct

390
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,700
there's several different versions of
this format arboretum there's a 26 bit

391
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,870
farther

392
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,580
the 37 bit for that and they're all
about two or three others

393
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,480
are the one for like that all is what's
called the corporate 1000 for that

394
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,399
the basic format these cards is its
simple data stream

395
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:08,790
header parody data parity for her

396
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,129
and a story most often

397
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:15,139
the number split into the first quarter
that

398
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:19,760
is a he's so right a cite code the
second half is your card number

399
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,700
the reason why they have psych codes is
so that you can use card number 12 345

400
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,409
anywhere in the world but if you're
psycho doesn't actually will be

401
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:29,730
instantly rejected

402
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,350
this is an enhanced over the years the
reason I bridge the Corporal 1000 system

403
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,000
is because it's a modification of the
standard format

404
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,169
that allows you to have up to a hundred
thousand cards within a single psycho

405
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,379
this is used by barge your national
corporations and so do you work for

406
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,060
corporations

407
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,760
X appear in New York City the issue ID
card

408
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,850
it's good anywhere in the world anyone
their facilities

409
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,520
this doesn't mean however that the
computers at the league office sometime

410
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,540
during the day

411
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,020
and talk back and forth to each other
which by the way any you have a good

412
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,399
sniffer

413
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:04,540
it's fine to take a look at so you have
this for the day

414
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,178
I'll facility code ID code

415
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:11,129
but we don't have that well if you just
want to say what the heck we'll have it

416
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,460
in with keypad

417
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,770
a little he doesn't go facility 123 car
tonight at seven six five four

418
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:23,010
it is possible it is also possible if
you do this to do it by brute force

419
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,730
one to 3 be no donations to

420
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:33,129
what nobody got hurt the years we were
down

421
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:37,560
okay so does because is it really
possible

422
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,820
is it possible to do this there is a
device for the Palm Pilot that will do

423
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,830
this

424
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,649
the company whose web page I keep
missing because obviously

425
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:51,070
keeps any team United forgetting to put
it down actually sells devices is forget

426
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,720
all your proximity cards

427
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,070
he's waiting for this little device and
relieve your proximity reader

428
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:02,720
and they're all stored your profile used
it when he was little reaches my

429
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,679
autonomy in love that site disappeared
about four months after I initially

430
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,490
talked about this at bogan

431
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,770
go figure I will list the little girls
that the front rows of giving doubting

432
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,290
boy boo boo boo what about what about
what about what about the business cards

433
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,450
at CIA

434
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,129
later on so

435
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:27,330
I didn't do that well for you on the
show you that this boy actually getting

436
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,580
does exist but

437
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,658
was the demo read only

438
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:34,500
either that or this is all your body
when this state I don't feel like being

439
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,490
the guest star on AWS next week

440
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,800
the concert the developing a system like
this that kids that go through will go

441
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,550
to

442
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,220
a swim through it's pretty scary

443
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,649
I was even scarier is that once you make
it portable

444
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,320
I can walk by you on a subway I can
stand next to you in an elevator

445
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,899
I don't bump into you on the street
lingo who's accused me

446
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:04,470
I just got your card information thank
you very much have a nice day

447
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,139
now the olden days you had as this deal
somebody's wallet which meant taking

448
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:12,100
them out getting drunk dancing a few
times the country line dancing or

449
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,280
are you bob is free and in the world

450
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,490
all the issue will be here don't worry
that would you do you take their card

451
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,429
away

452
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,389
when you go and then they go oh damn I
lost my car if they're smart they report

453
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:25,700
the security

454
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,300
how many people with you if you have
lost your bottom because before

455
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,580
how long did it take you to report it

456
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,389
one day over the weekend maybe three day
weekend ever reported that

457
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:43,530
doggedly of don't know what happened to
it I was walking my dog in all the

458
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,020
sudden it was gone

459
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,450
move over into the bag but I haven't
found it yet own

460
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,159
they can take up to two to three days so
does the average is reportable report

461
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,590
these things as a security report on
that

462
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,860
now the other part comes in is this says
physically stole your car

463
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,110
okay that other local your office even
like that so they go to me

464
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,820
close and I say hey are you doing I my
new year

465
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,330
on my bill I program computers in the
hell yeah

466
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,790
page watch friends last night the whole
do you think of the

467
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,389
so they see me walking around with you
still in bed post-holiday edges in a

468
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,159
year

469
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,690
my photos on it he is maybe it isn't

470
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,929
lot of times have we have photo ID's is
have photos of

471
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:33,929
okay that's a good start so what happens
if you see me photos naturally I don't

472
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:37,849
have to be bill so and so you grab me by
the neck need only outside

473
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:41,178
that's why we dissect the card

474
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,700
how many people here with consider this
to be in awe device about this in my

475
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,030
pocket in my briefcase what have you

476
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,428
the simple cheap are calculated to be
honest with you I got the syndicate

477
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:53,720
K-mart the 1995

478
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,330
Jake other bag fake Manuel many
calculator

479
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:04,330
well here's the kicker open it up there
is approximately guard is either

480
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,270
on his car was registered as

481
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:13,520
I'm a calculator it when people reviewed
the security logs at my office and they

482
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,399
said who is

483
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,339
other a I'm who I'm letter

484
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:22,899
market lot then popular calculator

485
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:27,330
on the calculator

486
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,980
but forgetting that part let's make it
easier cells I'd like I said is entirely

487
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,159
possible

488
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:37,179
silly walk past you Henry this
information

489
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,200
now how to get around this

490
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,520
what's the saving grace the answer is

491
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,580
there are a couple ways to protect
yourself from this but in reality

492
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,629
they're all pretty stupid number one

493
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:56,740
photo ID verification know what this
means is not just has this photograph on

494
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,220
the front

495
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,540
how many people since 9/11 it seems to
be believed really really strict about

496
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,668
security

497
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,020
and they want to stop you ever get you
the way you go through a building he had

498
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,460
that happen

499
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,929
the easiest people sittin' there those
five dollar for dollar or people sit by

500
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:13,849
the trial all day long largely you know
what went on that a little

501
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:17,859
most to these systems have the capacity
to store photograph in the database

502
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,790
along with the card information

503
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:24,168
use like that car the car slows down
he's really WWF weekly

504
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:27,520
he's actually a computer troubles that
you photograph

505
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,310
that's what about this election you are
he was the big red button the guys who

506
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,460
shot them sterile

507
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,720
who knows the line that movie is from

508
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,599
was playing this morning when I woke up
so I forgot about that

509
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,399
due diligence due diligence is the next
thing in harlem the biggest

510
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:49,399
holes will find in this people do not
practice due diligence with their

511
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:50,940
security systems

512
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,169
I've gotten two places at the audits in
third employees that

513
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:58,379
are no longer they're still in the
system although he he we are leaving

514
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,889
terminated me he told his card of other
leash or

515
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:05,200
meanwhile the capacity home going okay
well I think this guys love to know

516
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,990
about this as part of our remove all
this information

517
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,270
me the ALMS other Budweiser is going to
play a

518
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:15,320
think even worth but due diligence is
the big blue

519
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,780
how many there are people out here as
the charger will work in San physical

520
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,658
security

521
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:24,089
how often do you read your blogs

522
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,730
of very physical access laws

523
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,950
alright how many times have you seen

524
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:37,440
00 door left open door open without
reading

525
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,710
exactly and it's funny how people don't
even think to look at that

526
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,409
they don't review their loss this your
the whole she may be ready the security

527
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:48,810
log maybe

528
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,869
he said he looks at it online due
diligence

529
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:55,550
is probably the best tools you had
against this kind of physical access

530
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,770
hacking

531
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,399
and almost no one uses it as far as
protecting yourself from being right the

532
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,419
others will do you have a beloved EZ
Pass

533
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:08,629
give a little back in the game with EZ
Pass in case you don't want to use the

534
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:10,889
EZ Pass you put a little baggie

535
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:14,060
illumination Faraday cage a

536
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,280
that will stop it how many more do that
keep yourself safe new possibly hard

537
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,260
being read

538
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,639
the few people who are good yields
hardcore security people

539
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:27,690
most people want the proximity cards its
convenience they are

540
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,450
hold a majority in the Senate
long-legged at the same day

541
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,770
the more coffee launch TV there's a

542
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,820
people want that they want them to do

543
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,859
please don't call to the head of the
girl that's what they want

544
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,159
that's a mistake the making physical
access systems have you seen the fiscal

545
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,639
excesses as a card reader on one side

546
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:52,020
and on the other side is nothing but a
sensor

547
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,339
you walk up there BRB you open the door
again

548
00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:58,950
what's wrong with that a good close look
at the door

549
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,460
office you'll find about a half inch
yeah

550
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,440
as audiences thats half-inch yeah in the
door

551
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,040
going to the closet get a quote here PC
by 11

552
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,500
straighten up the go-ahead here here's
the paper into places

553
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,810
said it through their true the few
degrees way for the then walk in and

554
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,250
have a nice day

555
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,679
today I have surprised 18 executives

556
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,990
with that rip poll we'll be fine or
physical security audit nickel got the

557
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,109
rest leather office in the area with my
feet above the checkbook in my head

558
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:35,109
going high tides

559
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:39,849
they call the unprofessional a

560
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:44,250
I don't highly recommended that's all I
have no part in that

561
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,679
but the right now

562
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,500
I'm sure you gonna give me a little more
resolve this welcome to

563
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,260
how about I'll show you what I'm talking
about

564
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:02,560
its here another super secret program
that we need

565
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,750
no I'm using HyperTerminal in a big hole
the machine right here

566
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,290
because that's what I have available in
reality

567
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,178
however set the secret code 9600

568
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,770
a and one by that their

569
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,060
means-test later you could use a Palm
Pilot

570
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,129
a laptop any device that happens to be
spew out

571
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:31,379
RS 232 cell now comes the tricky part

572
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:34,450
would actually turn this thing on and
show it to you this is going to require

573
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,030
something really really sneaky though

574
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,109
and symbolism good experience at the end
you know that some songs that you have

575
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:43,730
rich person but

576
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,349
not to shoot she technically up there

hottest celebrity news celebrity those

578
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:57,080
I think this is letting the house as if

579
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,460
okay we have anybody from the NSF

00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,000
it's that simple kiss my head

610
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,240
%ah

611
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,560
you me info I we can try that one who is
this is a really cheap reader

612
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,430
and it will not be one again standard
leanza phone card

613
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:37,600
see yeah this one is locked down to
really only one game format for the

614
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,049
company I bought it from because it was
G

615
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,320
if I had a couple hundred dollars more
it would've been a lot easier to make

616
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,750
when the

617
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:50,100
reach from 234 Tenshi the promise of a
trip card

618
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,230
I okay this is the virus their carbon

619
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:01,540
the different number you can barely even
here the be but it's there

620
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,590
perhaps no

621
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,590
only have to do is developed the device
which already exists

622
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,110
as a little bit stronger little bigger
field

623
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:19,160
how hard is that that four hundred and
fifty dollars was it hard

624
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,700
and you think that this is some great
amazing thing you see what happened at

625
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,330
the wallpaper so what we did harder to
this market

626
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,970
but who can do this the changes her

627
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,080
that the second moving do this

628
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,110
how hard is it to do this you have to be
a who really needs

629
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:43,350
2600 reading I love the movie hackers
back and forth

630
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,569
I'll live with someone who looks just
like Angelina so that part doesn't care

631
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:51,340
trust me actually anybody with

632
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,180
285 dollars total

633
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:00,540
can go out in by a modifiable reader a
cordial

634
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,240
in a good ol fashioned at the back of
the pickup truck

635
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,870
Bowl lantern battery patrols I

636
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,500
get six inches its forty-eight also get
a little bit more anybody

637
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,330
can do this not always

638
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,290
it has in the standards Bosch that's all
I had

639
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,440
that is the that is the show that is the
proof of concept

640
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,640
it is not a big a lead from here to a
device that can store this information

641
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,350
be transmitted sloppy share not unlike
credit cards

642
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,830
at that point I with a few questions I
just want to get back up here

643
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,410
the microphone at all drops in the
questions operetta

644
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:48,410
I'm Osgood St

645
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,990
come on their all are you ready four
person game

646
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:04,070
okay this Motorola radios babe I hotel
in secret that is digital how much

647
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,650
these motherfuckers low

648
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,940
test test are you know well it's well
known that the cards can be read

649
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,400
there at all over the world you
demonstrate that they could be right now

650
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,080
how degenerate the bitstream the
alphabet streaming walk up to a reader

651
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:28,080
okay Joe what you have to do

652
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,819
in

653
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,510
you go to the website and you by the
political breakdown

654
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,140
what you have the protocol breakdown you
know the format for the code

655
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,920
you know how to party workers you know
which that the flaw should be flipped

656
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,270
in the other side of the webpage they
will show you

657
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,290
the frequency shift how to send the data
stream

658
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,480
at work rates and how often I don't know
how that information

659
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,900
giveaway frontières I give you gave me
she would anyone because again

660
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,710
ours you know all that stuff also its
valuable

661
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,040
its freely available you shake your head
you say no but EE

662
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,500
as a Russian who uses buoys buoys that
the stuff from the HID website options

663
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,900
from tech support section

664
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,110
up another company's HIV certainly judy
was that itself

665
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:23,990
you say no you can laugh and say oh
you're not going to jail he only uses

666
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,250
possibly cause the most in the city

667
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,270
little though he may have heard of

668
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,460
now it take a while

669
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,000
that this system can be dropped can be
broken can be exploited

670
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,710
budget they did just that still no
medical needs

671
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,440
word that's why some people still use my
striper

672
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,030
exacts boxcars headstones

673
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,660
years well their har other technologies

674
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,549
like for example cross smart cards with
John response

675
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,650
well worth right that's

676
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,580
something marks for its with your mother
Doris a writers and other commercial

677
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,620
available now

678
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,850
there are people who are using those who
kills

679
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,319
I agree physical physical access card is
because their car whether it be and I

680
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,070
but who

681
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,460
or some other kind of physical medium
smart cards

682
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,720
absolutely but you know what their
expenses in a lot about hospital closes

683
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,950
and not gonna pay for

684
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:29,730
I

685
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,020
say they're just as if you were to me
but they all are companies out there

686
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,560
that think that that's an extraordinary
expense he had 2,000 20,000 30,000

687
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,740
employees

688
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,860
she well host the

689
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,370
or other intangible car by

690
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:49,330
looking that runs with 20 with it
depends on the reader

691
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,890
the reader with the more powerful the
reader the more powerful feel that it's

692
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:58,529
more likely the longest Civil War argues
existing go i've seen it go to 10 to 15

693
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:58,990
G

694
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,430
is not unheard of for the go farther

695
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,770
and are

696
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:11,090
t-mobile's passes on the same no mostly
passive defense system altogether it

697
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,420
does not work on our ethnic and

698
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,630
it's something else in mind that you
working on working on that was some

699
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,420
other people

700
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,830
also models BBS don't use a direct are

701
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,319
correlation your your local Speedmaster
is an ID number

702
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,430
that is laid back real time match up
with a credit card number and the

703
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,319
information

704
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,400
yet that information never leaves their
day-to-day it was the gas stations just

705
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,560
the the system

706
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,560
or who is a bit slow for

707
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,420
I Lee I don't have the spot so that
leaves Merkel with

708
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,500
the both the physical speech class
itself

709
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,550
is easy it is a physical touch version I

710
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,030
the CRS version but the retransmission
back and forth

711
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,700
is it okay what was it I don't know how
to love

712
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:02,830
you had blue we all have a lot of
research animals be best but they give

713
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,560
you ideas in the golan was

714
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,940
yeah

715
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,630
actually more familiar with a contact
smart cards but OK

716
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:16,380
arm I don't think that the right word
for this is closing

717
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,030
I'll the car to the possibly both cuz

718
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,120
you're just answering one application
Houston City access control

719
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,270
you could use as furloughs if thankfully
it was for real

720
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,410
mom where they have like

721
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,970
and read/write to the car could

722
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,080
is that's a read/write card when I say
cloning what I'm talking about is the

723
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,790
initiation of the car pulling into the
device and using it again

724
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,600
it that should consider closing when you
look a hardcore

725
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,280
the crossbar with any other device with
the CD what have you

726
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,150
UK data from one source you duplicating
in the blaze is an exact replica

727
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,490
excluding but on is leaking

728
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,120
for this store others like how much
memory songs for us

729
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,549
very that usually no more than 26 bit
needles

730
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:11,940
the artist or more there are harder than
other information that's not the part

731
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,880
that word with

732
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,090
as other directory

733
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,380
stars on this photo is simply industry

734
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,060
it's just karo says that if that is true
group

735
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,819
and said what he said

736
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:31,930
with the readers some the Pearl really
who created

737
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,990
ho of our way can you be and something
to

738
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,089
ok as I said that is variable very to
the reader

739
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:41,599
if your readers are different God have
different areas influence

740
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,799
are you there only does Google Ventures
there are rumors that

741
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:49,339
go out to WC it's very easy to be used
on the reader and how much power you

742
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:50,150
feed into it

743
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:55,530
so any these companies actually planned

744
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:02,020
making me masakit model like he has so
there are more secure laurels not saying

745
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:02,530
that they are

746
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,690
I just case if you are you know where
another RF device like this

747
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,549
and they will have a key on yes there
they are to exchange cars that exist

748
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:12,349
like who is that

749
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:16,410
they're used mostly in vending machines
and fuck it let's just say

750
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,339
the two-way car has been goin hard does
exist is a used

751
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:24,150
for security purposes very rarely if the
has a key on

752
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,569
hell yeah irony on it was really the
best example gave earlier was the

753
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:29,750
ventilation system

754
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,559
would card holds one the murals you have
the key

755
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:36,589
unreadable city has together to terms
with Wichita

756
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:40,480
but you can still got that and then send
the house

757
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,099
because there was okay so that doesn't
actually like it he based system

758
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:47,420
know if you need me but you got their
agency

759
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,400
he is aware that you have some I have
not seen that yet outside smart cards

760
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,040
okay as I does work on SATs there that
doesn't mean it doesn't exist

761
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,400
team thing about these evils media told
me that's no good

762
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,369
with all this is a whole other ballgame
I've only had my hands on one of those

763
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:03,380
devices

764
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:09,230
and I E who don't so what has what they
want to donate

765
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,410
goes no I do know though those I have
murdered

766
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,040
and this is also information so feel
free to call the others do but I do

767
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,380
believe EZ Pass does look at the
microwave range

768
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,630
and that also explains me

769
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,940
Harvey devices are over-the-top the
drive under but that

770
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:30,160
that I do not have a certain beyond
young other parts opossum

771
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,410
all as far as it was fairly easy as is a
passive device

772
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,420
a Ian still it takes energy

773
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:42,760
residents of the region is it bad about
personally familiar with the

774
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,900
charles is both advises love the way
they have anything goes

775
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,920
rate-limiting so far as are feeling and
challenges but imagine that they have a

776
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,450
little to the same kind of thing

777
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,119
in that the the challenges on of
indicated maybe from anywhere that

778
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:59,240
theoretically if you could bump into
somebody for long enough to be

779
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,060
impossibly long

780
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,299
North you could potentially issue every
possible chance and receive all those

781
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,920
repost oh no that's the real or not a
person

782
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,760
yeah I want your office reader sitting
there go to lawton play

783
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,610
next year and put this all by standard
lens that one day this is how I know it

784
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,840
was it was successful

785
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,119
the media it is possible the brute force
it would be pretty often is also this is

786
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:23,430
where due diligence comes with a hook
for such as building additional

787
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,310
right well thats me the dictionary
attack brute-force attack

788
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:31,990
not sure who I mean you never know what
charles is going to be issued by the

789
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,300
National readers usually every possible
challenge and then when you encounter

790
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,390
the actual reader

791
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,190
you receive a challenge you look at
their children you already know that

792
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,090
work for smaller

793
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,350
that that's what do diligence ginza if
someone sees

794
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:46,920
a thousand it seems that failed in one
lesson see that means a visa

795
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,630
something p

796
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,020
is only resources those without seasonal
those out too

797
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:03,020
okay with that that doesn't exist

798
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,200
the challengers thoughts systems usually
based around a smart card slot cars are

799
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,070
not all this because you are deaf people
harder to go to the rim

800
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:15,609
car cassini's

801
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:18,830
yes wireless smartphones I see
combinations

802
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:23,180
mark our cable wireless and love every
smart card I've seen as a little chip on

803
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:23,560
it

804
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,230
you have to actually put this into a
really big physical contact those

805
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,350
probably chose responsible design

806
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,368
and you know there's any honey lazy you

807
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:41,369
usually challenges yes you know there's
anything I didn't know

808
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,109
rate-limiting really hurt in the car
Daisy

809
00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:53,109
only in just those mood well not all in
the first was good but I have not heard

810
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,570
about that was bookmark I have not seen
that

811
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,670
and I'm definitely going to that is that
something what would you do

812
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:07,670
him

813
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,980
with these these these smart cards moon

814
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,050
is no it's not it's not the same as
others in Clovis has been

815
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:27,050
okay

816
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,980
in not by me own skin

817
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,060
some deals look into I my hands on that
system

818
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,100
as well as low one other thing is that

819
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,670
does anybody know if these are his
proximity challenge response was that

820
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:48,160
the

821
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,700
that the challenges of indicated in any
way over can anybody effectively issue a

822
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,660
chance but being in proximity

823
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,940
nobody knows

824
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:04,920
lovely thank you okay

825
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:11,920
the ONS 0

826
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:17,420
are he used to live on it

827
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,210
the transmission and it is that
transferring to the perfect scanner

828
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:26,550
and it does people who are we there
usually yes that's a sizable

829
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,000
so I'm it was on his back that's my
phone doesnt

830
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,450
a convo I i do believe I said I don't
know about it and all I know is

831
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,880
representing himself

832
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,880
a go as well

833
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:46,470
I but that's a whole other area research
and I will look at what happens all the

834
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:46,800
time

835
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,730
that's not what this is about but there
is it is what else

836
