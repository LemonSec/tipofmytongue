that's how the filmmaker that's it

177
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,130
arm that's pretty much all I had a
making this arm

178
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,430
same thing with manual he had not done
this before

179
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,040
however he's been wanting to do it for
years I'll everest

180
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,380
I remember the first time he approached
me about it was when I was talking

181
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,110
something

182
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:44,110
abstract about video I after the n97
conference

183
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:47,689
I

184
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:51,140
I myself have not done filmmaking for
the

185
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,290
I yes in this say you then

186
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,469
grayish sure you what

187
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:03,440
I think I

188
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,440
the

189
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,980
general reception of people in different
areas in general public

190
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,730
com it varies a lot depending on who you
show it to

191
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,170
are injured actors in obviously know
what the what the outcome is going to be

192
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,680
there

193
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,800
arm at film festivals on the the people
are also pretty wide open in general

194
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,690
all they've you know lived a lot of
probably with the long hard life a lot

195
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,190
of them

196
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,260
and they up came identify with some
things

197
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,920
said documentary and generally like it
in Europe which showed a couple times

198
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
and there were a couple

199
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,920
are small jokes that were sort of a

200
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,510
I don't you call a specific examples

201
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,069
all because they can recall is %uh we
had I gone C you the

202
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,470
National Labs and I we said it was
calmer well-kept

203
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,060
nuclear secrets and about a week we had
already added that he was out was in the

204
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,120
can and

205
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,700
about a week before issuing showed it
I'll we had the

206
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,610
a nuclear secrets release from the same
laboratory

207
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,430
so it sort of had a a a a original Joe

208
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,050
and um people at the whole lot more near
commended hearings

209
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,060
com also bad at the end their bomb

210
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:43,440
Hollywood we had a that's that's that's
the way life is that's lame Eric Mun

211
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,940
this is america that's the way you know
what I'm talking about it that

212
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,540
I can remember the exact quote right now
but saw

213
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,329
in Europe they had they left a lot more
that and on

214
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:01,330
to pay and we showed it to and now film
theater and piano

215
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,750
the film festivals I'll people there
were laughed out loud they were rolling

216
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,410
with laughter

217
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,870
and when we showed it to a a a group of
us science fiction

218
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,700
pops on they didn't get it selling very
a lot

219
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:22,430
and the yellow lanyard there

220
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,320
I

221
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,540
I

222
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,560
and

223
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,570
I

224
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,570
mobile the 1

225
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,200
the

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,430
I I'm why was the trial delayed so long

227
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,650
our manuals much better I weight and a
much better answer this I'm sure but so

228
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,660
basically it was I'll each side

229
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,069
army trying to push it further back all

230
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,580
no single side was responsible for on I
don't think

231
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,070
but it was it was a lot of emotions
there was more motions in this case then

232
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,930
and

233
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,020
I heard this that is it was more motions
in this case there was in any other case

234
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,569
in

235
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,390
the Israel backcourt all-male is just

236
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,510
motion after motion to motion each one
requiring

237
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,180
extra time to delay the trial all and

238
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,410
kevin was actually trying to to get to
trial however he was not prepared to do

239
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,969
it on on fairground on

240
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,720
and unfair waters so I'll when it was
necessary I believe he also agreed to

241
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,440
to delay it however arm I will honestly

242
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,720
after seeing all this all the evidence
and all the other ollie papers I would

243
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,570
attributed to the I state California a
lot more than I would together

244
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,280
yes go ahead the

245
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,829
close

246
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,550
this

247
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,470
how long is it how much money did it
cost you 1 do this whole thing

248
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,450
that's a thirty million dollars

249
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,790
that's a good question and we don't
really know

250
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,089
nor do we really want to allman
independent film

251
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,960
it's always a given that you will never
ever ever may back the money

252
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,400
you put into making it arm and this is
no exception

253
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,830
it's hard to put a number on it because
we've been living anyway

254
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,610
so if we're leaving here for a living in
a car traveling across the United States

255
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,600
it's really not a whole lot different
we're not sure had a add all that

256
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,190
together

257
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,570
I can tell you the camera cost a few
thousand Lee spend a few thousand tapes

258
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,400
we had a

259
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,850
a special machine I'm set aside with
thousands of a host of

260
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,340
car drives a pair it was it was all
about 30 hard drives

261
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,510
I this machine we had a big machine to
do this arm

262
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,900
and other random expenses so

263
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,090
%uh I flights and so on and so forth

264
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,530
how much did it cost in the end I'll
there's

265
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,689
really know number that we can put a
finger on and

266
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,690
I'm sorry that the best answer I have to
give overtime

267
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,160
our city cause the taxpayers rescue
Kevin I know it was a big number

268
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,279
arm when it was released by someone

269
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,770
or calculated by someone and my brain is
telling me

270
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,829
$35 million but I'm not sure

271
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,709
I really don't know and Emmanuel might
if and when he gets here

272
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,310
engineer while ago

273
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,510
yes go ahead

274
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,990
lined why yeah also

275
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,660
no the friend

276
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,339
a

277
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,309
who we filmed everything but not
everything made into a movie I mean

278
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,069
we've got I think it was in the nati
hours it was 100 hours

279
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,439
100 hours about film so you know i mean
every job we not that interesting

280
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,469
returning the car

281
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,100
we you know it was probably just %ah
this kind 1-yard run broke happen

282
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,459
and what's filmmakers funny yeah we are
seeing you guys never will and they we

283
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:52,819
just

284
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:57,079
regis film because you know film was
kinda sorta chief not really

285
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,389
right out it was cheap enough that we
just me or do stuff like that

286
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,619
arm so we did are you on the question
was

287
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:10,019
a you like who we have like to have
interviewed NY obviously a sandwich or

288
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:10,589
tomorrow

289
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,679
would have been at the top of that list
are for obvious reasons are we could

290
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,660
never find him and we did make a valiant
effort

291
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,420
to to do that arm Christian real
interview

292
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm not sure if it would work out very
well but says some reactors

293
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,540
from takedown are might have been
interesting to interview

294
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,300
at least you know not maybe not death
I'm not sure how much they had

295
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,550
tribute to it but it will be interesting
to see you know more sides with Sr

296
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,760
as you know the %uh the other producers

297
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,810
a ran away from us as we we try to you

298
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,270
to find them harm so that they would
also been pretty interesting to talk to

299
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,180
a sparse but

300
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,300
I think miramax disorder change their
mind on official evelyn just

301
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,620
they ran away instead or maybe they were
never authorized to talk to us in the

302
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,360
first place

303
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,690
is another guess other people it's hard
to

304
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,750
I can't really think abandoned

305
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,400
know the questions

306
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,799
comments

307
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,900
items

308
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,420
okay I guess a male never made it sorry
about that on

309
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,220
will be hanging around up here if you
want to ask us anything individually and

310
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,790
I'm sure

311
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,430
man you'll be here shortly maybe yeah
