first for

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,400
parts of this is off

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,640
a there are you well fuck

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,320

Lawrence sleep here

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,920
later on years but don't expect

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,550
elsewhere

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,520
so I'll first of cell

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,520
shape C

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,210
below

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,980
there when you're mean now I had to go
on

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,280
a you can you can call me their job man

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,840
parrado whichever you prefer doesn't
make much difference to me

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,150
I and I guess today I just knew about

24
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,540
of the best but British to me and some

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,830
I feel love injured and the I

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,240
academic research me %uh care networks

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,740
a on was the actual shape and structure

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,159
I'll how the actual Canada take for

29
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,440
while subscribe to the actual patient
which let me keep wild

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,630
to chemical it really is not hard to
translate

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,120
about what I you to be the

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,220
critical research is being done back in
I

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,550
over to the acne cuz a must be on to
something they made by autozone

34
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,739
basic prowlers my catalogued

35
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,819
he did go along both they don't know

36
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,790
a song haha for display for a purpose

37
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,890
doing here who is at hand but bomb 2002
it

38
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,590
is a big network probs your two weeks
ago

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,540
shut up I what I mean

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,030
by the ship it yet a there are several
ways that we can

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,400
we define structure a

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,780
we can look at a Holiday web level and
the saga of URL links

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,209
I will be looking on the you double
route of a lot of physical Ethernet

44
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,480
a located confident on a big deal I'll

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,170
this is another good example a so
they've resorted

46
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,760
I people remember couple years ago that
once said that the

47
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,620
shit but i their mother and

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,820
this year I'll

49
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,108
that was a you are loved and I think
about the network and cable

50
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:31,510
both types of directed graphs the if
that was true

51
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,980
the most said too early or traverse
partnership

52
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,600
but I'll conventionally most people
thought the yet we ship

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,769
something like what's following graph I
was going to work

54
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,799
graphis they won here wherever

55
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,170
the whole ok people I'm

56
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:57,019
graph theory is busy about now struction
we find said

57
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,120
a reached by Brett P a

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,530
foresees I just 0

59
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,160
rather sorry

60
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,520
are

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,480
other ok

62
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,940
if I read this over tonight is the NASA
Jet

63
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,280
by its as it were

64
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,460
air about artisans so for example

65
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,500
it really is a very simple ready prime
new

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,370
no reading

67
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,389
creators you %uh

68
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,330
Christ are so

69
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,240
as a public record be think that would
be a

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,350
readers 3s this is actually Halloween
model

71
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,280
a most a.m. relation nigga examples of
the

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,000
a six degrees of Kevin Bacon for example

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,310
there for you for one for each

74
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,530
know to be an actor him scholarship

75
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,169
sooo vision had would reverse

76
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,389
the to grab from one the actual throw

77
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,740
headline would be to traverse a drink
and a happen knowing

78
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,310
said this process of software for
example a nap at

79
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,470
something along those lines on the
agenda they're doing number

80
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,600
this basic of our way person is from
although

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,300
this old heart if there's a call people

82
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,330
Paul about settlers that that so

83
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,169
people thought unit was was what was
called

84
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,290
a lot number it's about

85
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:52,290
or 360 quickly

86
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,940
this review will often grab the bring
anything with you

87
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,160
while follow hollow

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,720
I basically you say you're an appeal

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,470
know it

90
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:14,470
and a connection between them is based
off the

91
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:21,710
great play relationship is based off of
this thing

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,930
and be arrival

93
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,250
the deficit housing as much as measuring
just simple

94
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,250
he and I disagreed individual okay

95
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,840
I mean testing ground for all investors
suffered

96
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,970
so you out of her bowling where as you

97
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,340
check it out we actually have my and
there really isn't

98
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,380
sure anything over patient also invest
for problems

99
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,800
there are some of my call to order doing
this but

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,760
all in one product or crap while you
know seniority

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,770
performs are similar to trying time

102
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,460
while you so yes you know ABC

103
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,500
can don't know exactly what the football

104
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,890
a birthday you know what the whole
structure in the NL you try to turn

105
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,120
you know I do about that for using iraq
model

106
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,790
for example one one being away for
national on being just a simple random

107
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,690
graph so

108
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,750
of us back to 99 was got by the above

109
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,120
russian Prime on the skyline at my house
politics

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,960
these days now a professor at UC
Riverside was working on his

111
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,680
PhD and all cast as doctor

112
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,310
many times over the you that the fire
you know

113
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,970
do you know it or not know the point
Castries as a waffler

114
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,640
I more yes in early neighborhood

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,969
a and Israel rattling good well

116
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:04,080
Bible Castleview percent you you have
initiation for all have our

117
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,609
he or something along those lines you
define their webpage

118
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,530
was a Chris fire tree across it I'll

119
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,570
and the after the initial Papa home now

120
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,770
major I don't want to reproduce in
Pakistan got a great solution

121
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,060
doing and it broke and

122
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,010
surface you know there were great the
word out but

123
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,349
a is much easier to do occasionally
things to do

124
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,580
where application layer later

125
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,110
or later 502 a technology to roll out
six months

126
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,690
layer 3 take some time before the times
and he always does

127
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,870
buttons so I'll he is working on the

128
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,680
doc open to the I yes

129
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,610
and so on this committee that amino well
out yes say

130
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,350
hello about the business ministry were
and the life of malcolm

131
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,960
how happens this is a while no she unit
Yahoo

132
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,060
as a quality although the guys these
cases one group do so much

133
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,029
by the other files in iTunes and

134
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,320
meanwhile is a two brothers were also
out

135
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,170
and you're on the air officers names

136
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,660
but I'll say says it right where they
want me to meet him PhD

137
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,850
the office you that as one brother I
just read a book called

138
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,399
practice chaos all of

139
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,540
I'll visions from

140
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,329
had to mention think there's photo and
he had trouble

141
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,350
branches all over there has to be a
proper diet proper I

142
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,470
fractal they will I think I think well
every natural process

143
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,339
and being a fractal sovyetsky 12 and

144
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,190
will how to go about proving lessons on
the conventional love

145
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,750
showing something at approximately
outbox gonna like if you do

146
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:07,750
that area post on you with me down box
above a certain size

147
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:14,089
you know I by and a recount I'm a
possible to take cover

148
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,610
that area and the

149
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,709
the next thing you do is you readers is
that we decided

150
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:25,240
I like ever to rehab i gt three times as
many

151
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,779
of it gets too high where

152
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:32,610
power Tao this book publishing

153
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,420
because of so what is the ETA and do it
right

154
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,860
chaos somehow I will change yeah ok
we'll talk a lot about

155
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,920
Vienna or have two numbers I'll be in
Ohio

156
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,040
drivable thought a lot about the game so
the

157
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,040
stop what they did

158
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,800
and pull out to be media from

159
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,070
places like the was not just for

160
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,270
for on that one years now but they were
things that he

161
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,790
India he he

162
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,870
be hard

163
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,339
got why like I'll

164
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,740
it that way you get this now from

165
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,300
places like a and model a

166
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,450
K that were

167
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,420
debut album putting on a slide was hell
haha

168
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,719
but this is for the epicenter for alpha

169
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,790
or created an hour

170
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,790
I am I the only good unity house but I
do

171
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,140
point pop bottle stoppers tried tonya

172
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,880
so global problems with our

173
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,140
on in Kosi here well

174
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,830
be needed it they basically been a drop
in progress other day

175
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,610
and so you have centralized point you
know I

176
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,790
this would be some yes sauces their
workload be

177
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,130
alright was pgp

178
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,180
you have a with the small networks for

179
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,310
but you are smoking house you just after
a smaller

180
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,320
day let them go to a

181
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,970
are small or six more it up yet most
four hours

182
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:31,970
situation like this

183
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,280
other

184
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,629
Telegraph

185
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:43,519
your you have a your hair routers r1 r2

186
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,869
here you know here 3

187
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:50,569
your mail server web server new

188
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:56,250
news user his

189
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,570
all anyway

190
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,200
I and even in this situation is that a
crime but when you start getting more

191
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,620
more

192
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,400
but what about use it to him and he
arrived for all such as Rep

193
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,960
or our yeah Rivers was call a this is
that the protocol

194
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,670
an hour yeah doesn't speak for all
basically just a doctor on

195
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,950
communications neighbors

196
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,140
a media make it nation and the

197
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,500
link-state protocols broadcaster and
harmful

198
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,330
nope a the information at all on getting
inside

199
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,420
sub what to do about the Sun or inside

200
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,670
about the ISP you get here to aspin's

201
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,740
here to ask you to do the same thing all
yeah giving notice to internal running

202
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,270
columns when you get here one

203
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,030
for example there's no real good
agreement on how to route between q1

204
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,280
high-speed can you know know what that
meant

205
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,449
a protocol something like that Phillips

206
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,460
those changes taken off a valid point
the actual map up it doesn't matter if

207
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,480
you're a controller

208
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,540
where ago so a PDP does also have a
situation

209
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,449
have a and knows here will call the

210
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,840
Apple this is a

211
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,330
oversaw

212
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,300
this is a ISP with a

213
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,490
possible

214
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,200
back

215
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,629
never foresaw this

216
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:29,410
I say this is a so I beloved up on us
two routes to

217
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,249
possible to physical possible ways
actually across

218
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:37,799
I want through Microsoft what a nice day
Apple won't sell

219
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,579
this possible product other than 100 no

220
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,629
outside so how he actually be all go
about now

221
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:49,129
wrong with packets going to the hospital
without having to cross you know

222
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,850
Microsoft welcome in Toronto say
whatever's best at heart a

223
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,749
the end BTP it was called this inspector
protocol

224
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:59,809
all they do share a physical

225
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:06,259
interconnections they say the Microsoft
that harbors therefore broadcast I'll

226
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:09,329
broadcast Apple

227
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,799
you get to customer through

228
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,149
me then to the ISP that night

229
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:20,119
yeah I one as

230
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,359
roughly idea ISP broadcast

231
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:26,910
to Apple you get a customer kermit

232
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,488
and so what happens is that happened to
solicit these rocks

233
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:35,589
and he's able to say up by file local
policy

234
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,799
which is completely million to they're
typically on

235
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,470
his neighbors I'll which one is right
the

236
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,939
you think about it busy are you doing
here stating in cable connect from here

237
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:48,509
with you

238
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,449
you know if I was I'd like people a on
the surface this

239
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:55,529
seen very private reality its very
product

240
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,269
a and there's a lot

241
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:02,910
I remarkable years ago

242
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,519
our much

243
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,430
we are at that park officials say the
bird five minutes

244
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,899
as hell reason why is because be the
roster changes KCP&L

245
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,379
core if a to appears to not trust each
other

246
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:20,079
up in your site of a mouse you will get
your peers not

247
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,259
prosecutor about dropping Pakistan side
TCP window and struck

248
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:26,379
teams that's actually not

249
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:29,589
to easy traditionally should know that
he was on

250
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,160
cation but government Tunisian

251
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,550
showed that is possible to predict with
them

252
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,129
a service to circle are the initially
with others use by

253
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:46,600
different operating systems based off
lightly toasted subs

254
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,790
so general it's possible yes

255
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,189
freshman year that

256
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:58,379
I digress so but there was extracted

257
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,089
they create a very long left a ball

258
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,370
I'll also been heeded

259
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,679
thank you here you would do this we're

260
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,439
you know standard structures

261
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,250
see you guys just you know get the file

262
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,490
enclosed it's the kind of person grows

263
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,660
will be the most optimal dust ruffle

264
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,700
but so they define this

265
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,380
the structure and they want a certain
physical measurements on the structure

266
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,809
now as we go back to the last breath but
they were due

267
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:42,809
analysis we want to look at the offering
personally

268
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:50,879
what this is about again as a
graph-theoretic concepts

269
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:54,320
basically is a number I just upgraded
from our

270
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,759
a for a specific new a

271
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,029
and grab your love to have a

272
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:07,070
digress for change dropped the grass
tickles and kisses no day

273
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,749
there's no the office yeah farmers over

274
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:13,960
school about which we love it other
autographs

275
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,659
so for example we look at this node on a
jittery

276
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,179
personal by this guy through 3

277
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,820
for to I saw

278
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,249
and today may

279
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:33,929
they went through and I did this for
every they create a graph that is

280
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:34,909
rendered today

281
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:38,320
people yesterday for other random graphs
I

282
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,119
heard around stoller rest ordering
starring grass mean is that

283
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,230
years overseas the

284
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,249
which has a universal was a

285
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:53,820
adequate size little is it over possible

286
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,090
persons was ourselves the riders and
they would

287
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,809
Asia is to eventually great though I
never edges

288
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,168
vision 0@ to a

289
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,539
the by the Botswana to

290
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,289
was quickly grab basically every
possible educators dozen best

291
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:18,039
hurry I miss someone

292
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,359
that K war that

293
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,310
was a

294
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,950
our options that's escape or

295
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,370
busy with that yes oh notice every
possible ejecting just between two nodes

296
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,150
doesn't

297
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,790
that progress at eighty-four world

298
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:43,790
one to 3456 so it

299
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:55,550
right my the

300
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,830
whatever is wrong are yes that I'll

301
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,990
and sewing holler then there'd ever
really aggressive you look at for

302
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,500
example

303
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,360
the other great which we discussed was
the rack Ridge Bay C if you're making or

304
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,830
less

305
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,030
a lawyer the reason Service Co for for

306
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,090
or 3 okay

307
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,590
where you at work on 12

308
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,639
or or the plot

309
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,640
on one axis

310
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:39,510
the

311
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,849
way

312
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,419
first three

313
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,070
I complete graph we get a reply

314
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,189
online a queer and wrapping it was cool
was under siege

315
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,350
but something like this

316
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,970
for a look at a log-log scale

317
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,660
with propaganda you something putting
sure

318
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,790
anti-racist realize it was

319
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,470
how long relationships what this means a

320
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,920
we define function

321
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,050
G a here they have access

322
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,350
ga:an times actually able to %uh

323
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:31,690
a G that's put them into the scale the
input it's the original box and scaling

324
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:31,940
down

325
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,000
small-scale I example if you look at the

326
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,430
priroda at about five o'clock west line
thousand miles away

327
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,280
okay his life from you heard other are
the way it was like from your life loves

328
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,100
on the exact same shit it a good thing
here's why 10 centimeters away

329
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,740
no time same shit this is what I say
that same

330
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,280
general structure cue or over over them

331
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,920
doesn't matter what skill you look at it
on you just have

332
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,010
the original network scale either per
hour

333
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,570
and today down on a beach in Hilo

334
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,750
at the end it actually takes as part of
stock thank you Kevin

335
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,070
back here we have a completely man-made
structure

336
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,169
are that his own there's a very very
well

337
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,860
by it takes is very in a

338
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,940
proper about being a proper

339
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,149
let me see over and over

340
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,119
and waste time you and I that's one
reason why Road

341
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,149
case obviously now while

342
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:39,309
obispo

343
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:42,690
I'll was probable reasons

344
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,749
that have been cited and

345
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:49,610
this is really up to today very well on

346
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,539
the first I businesses by nato

347
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,980
para bessie it poses and nature but to
log on when he says is that

348
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,889
your watching grow grass by adding nodes

349
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:10,149
and no one connect you notorious over
the network by

350
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,499
at that rate connection for who

351
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:17,649
connect to as a function of the upgrade
Park

352
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:21,129
basically saying is that want to me
offer people

353
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:24,779
I want to interact with the more popular
at work forecaster

354
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:30,760
before just anybody and this is the
initial model

355
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,040
I there was a problem with and they were
unable

356
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,409
poised to do it and give themselves so

357
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,610
ago saw Sunday today my painting other

358
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,670
was at the end based interfaces growth
over time

359
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,510
and reasons are because economic reasons

360
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,150
that is initial graffiti his home
government-sponsored

361
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,350
he would just you connections to

362
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,790
whoever west highway on they're trying
to do

363
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,100
the cheapest service provider cancer
risk driving

364
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,800
one him abroad alright

365
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,310
the timescale and

366
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,190
30 pretty fascinating just earnest
questions

367
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,150
what this would imply a

368
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,350
we have a network that that

369
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,370
a vast majority connection

370
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,790
lay very few people for example I think
team

371
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,780
most neck to no but I was hoping that in

372
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,320
apollo system here I

373
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,550
we have another beer about what this
means that you know

374
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,430
were to drop of BGP route

375
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,970
there be a big problem to be doing

376
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,820
private of also it is a happy corrugated

377
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,260
here as at one point maybe two years ago

378
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,670
about 20 up these pop top-tier

379
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,640
how Macintosh systems I have now

380
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,080
70 gone out of business

381
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,600
we're still seeing you know you're
probably

382
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,340
were so senior mergers and acquisitions
area so

383
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,899
what does this mean of is it the

384
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:35,039
this the the procope close more scared

385
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,230
Ocean Park I'll we have

386
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,929
draw all their work that they would be
an awesome

387
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:49,929
measured now

388
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,809
think I've centralized a recovery

389
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,710
we're all are in the finals with the
proper 2007

ice cubes are responsible

392
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,040
line outside a ride a

393
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,559

part of drought

403
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,610
despot but this is not

404
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:27,610
paid protesters on water generalization
a

405
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,799
me

406
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,889

409
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,970
more of trouble alright on him

410
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,460
well abstract were good example a major

411
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:02,460
with for major

412
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:13,040
for

413
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,870
you know for treated right the main
branch

414
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,260
which stands out offside do you have

415
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,960
the mission it's more so branches pretty
well as leaves

416
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,630
the exact same structure diminishing

417
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,150
a smaller means and you know he's
individually

418
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:36,260
gases instructions is it perfect example

419
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,270
are asking act is scavenging food from
problem or permitted playfully

420

weather

421
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,879
biology presley yeah

422
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,690
one other person was because we were
most engine species

423
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,720
and today's are lost russia

424
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,780
which means that I lost my very amusing
bring natural

425
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:04,780
to well

426
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,310
lol

427
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,860
the summer fractal I'll you know

428
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,650
is your all and reason why these in his
terms of

429
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,890
it because the he was gonna be stationed
way

430
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,200
then it began to realize only I love
first

431
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,710
a for example you see machine term long
term

432
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,950
and its long-range one-dimensional
produce

433
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,830
one national problem the bring out

434
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,060
you one heavy rain every

435
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,090
a probably you

436
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,510
a we get heavy rain every 12 months New
Year the

437
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,690
her everything you told it rained every
12 months

438
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,790
you get one here heavy rain over twelve
years need twelve years arrange a

439
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,960
wonderful orders

440
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,990
I this actually has been shown

441
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,290
physical analysis by God heard trends I

442
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,520
reservoir agent wanna see how a big read
more

443
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,410
busy looking sooo family structure

444
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,280
the I'll get early access to start
making

445
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,570
track yes and

446
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:28,570
as a lot of patience for runners on yes
them with

447
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,970
pop

448
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:54,659
I don't believe there is there's not the
room with the vision

449
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,799
supposedly love affair with core and
from

450
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:01,599
there is a seniors only has Asian the
only route

451
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:08,599
but at the problem is

452
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:14,459
after in the policies that he was in
place and and every

453
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:17,959
like unit but their situation here draw
for us

454
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,259
okay the organic powerball new slave

455
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:24,639
driving off topic kerry well and she's

456
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:28,609
organizations a had to go if I
communicate with each other to try to

457
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:29,259
figure out

458
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:32,909
hollow tree new policy to so that
everyone

459
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:36,149
possible no we don't need a Charlie
Brown tree follow

460
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:39,729

I have to refuse a caterer and the

462
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:48,940
it's actually happening right now
there's a lot of push saying that you

463
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,639
know we got

464
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,619
that speed reason why is because the
person he is at the hands of protocol

465
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:58,879
the only reason why your network opposes
handful people around the world in a PGP

466
00:31:58,879 --> 00:31:59,789

key problems of tables make sure the air
doesn't break right now just Spears

480
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:08,009
not for scientific research got feel
case you if you make mistakes

481
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:12,049
desperate happens actually record I

482

484
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:22,049
to now and they're out of traffic over
the net went unanswered

485
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:26,259
AT&T without hear what happened is

486
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:33,259
also to bed

487
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:44,659
I N two and this simple hey this is
definitely on for a lil

488
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,510
yes

489
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,970
my non-arab song boss brass him out

490
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:08,970
dropping active he's a healer well

491
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:21,668
yes

492
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:31,080
exactly that's the problem

493
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,639
alright so we have and knows show bgp

494
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,120
color actually a crap about twenty years
it for me they're out there

495
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,710
20 a short work week being a complete
cure so

496
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,490
we take it we notice are dropping
packets each other their sessions

497
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:55,490
injured what happens sisters I N Save
impossible to the whole

498
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,570
nothing's impossible a but

499
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,810
what happens is that as downplayed

500
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,170
j1 the other

501
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,130
damn I think went out

502
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,330
as you a as to rather talking to each
other maybe you know the

503
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,270
maybe flap first opera star that

504
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,640
problem try to instantiated bombs that
entire idea

505
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,640
you just give the flap not try to get an
answer out again

506
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,020
bout between joe I start when they stop
problem if you do it right

507
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,870
not even though they're point we anyway
cause troubles

508
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,040
a bizarre it's difficult

509
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,550
as a heads up I don't say it's as a
disease is non-trivial

510
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,850
but is it possible yeah

511
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,770
are its corporate partners

512
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,140
up let's see what's left for wanna talk
about

513
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:59,790
style on

514
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,750
it had rather I'll get that by one

515
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,990
what is the solution for I pose a
challenge to you as I do not have time

516
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,420
to do something that I definitely prior
to this story

517
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,690
on my greater re:

518
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,690
a a lot better yeah

519
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,590
underlines really works they won't work

520
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:24,210
I'll and I find that we're going to a
few months later the hard

521
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,070
movie I is the challenge

522
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:32,310
stuff while tell if you're going to love

523
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:39,290
leon of people alright upper age 11
architecture works is that you have a

524
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,490
ago and you come into a network your a
lot of been there

525
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,110
your car negotiation the access point
your day

526
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,640
is in our most popular here get here nor
there must be the same rate which other

527
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,420
than they

528
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,920
do abroad yesterday they all those back
researchers have to come up with things

529
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,750
for the

530
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,820
while of running for all within
elsewhere I V and touched on by industry

531
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,460
like that

532
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,090
isn't going to have a good job on back
there

533
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,280
upload photos of the event for my idea
and they've been

534
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,920
be out pretty well this described there
isn't a very good

535
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,740
a well-written support for the same
mobile operating systems

536
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,070
water levels below fish are running for
all now

537
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,060
although ad hoc on-demand I want all the
the SR

538
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,279
I that outsource routing

539
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,810
yeah any step 1:

540
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,980
ever met the run for all never offered

541
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,300
that too

542
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,850
people who are located here

543
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,870
its day it's the the term bandied about

544
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,000
to be the death but I think free.net

545
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,020
as a few and lost every effort at way
free Nexon exit initial hose

546
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,020
as he goes on to a the the name

547
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,740
cord or tell us the IP addresses for his
first local peers

548
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,310
grab this and I user ok away

549
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,529
and access got 50 of the collector to
you cool water bill

550
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,070
that's got an hour to make you know what
the right P

551
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,120
and grab that this step 2

552
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,880
play while those ad hoc network
groundless

553
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,640
first people connect to one of your
system from the world local rowdy

554
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,830
step 3:

555
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,870
and moments in his pocket up

556
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,720
arena or don't naturally yeah i layer
for here systems

557
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,400
a their where there was enough right now
one hundred

558
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,870
do you like email and a new services
about free

559
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,600
find out what they were doing ahora

560
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,880
and result you can have several thousand
people about the laptop

561
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,190
jack and the owners want our are

562
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,280
and so putting power made network every

563
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,740
boy fuckhole boy are we're on to

564
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,460
without having to go off the court well
with the wifey

565
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,750
look at your system without having to
use

566
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,890
Corvallis at they were

567
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,970
reason why I bring this up because of
structural while spread

568
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,630
allows hollow is going to be prima
five-nation

569
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,900
I a lot of progress

570
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,380
which means that there are no very
hyperactive

571
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,910
she learned long me that's all well in
hotels I found a little outcry

572
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,529
but everything just bill in the proper
or improper about

573
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,630
our we doing this for the future

574
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,400
sisters long yeah resolve the

575
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,400
network with us for usable

576
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,640
point came with me that no one thing
appointing

577
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,779
for being our like me

578
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,230
so yet about time do something like this

579
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:01,640
but so far I have nothing against you

580
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,120
fashion what what nationality is very
eyes

581
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:12,120
they've had a four hour

582
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,390
%uh that's true so how can you solve the
health care system you don't

583
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:25,259
your other back you could not do you
have sharing network where is already

584
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,600
packed with people don't you

585
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,730
and actually that's been worked out and
I incorrect often

586
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,220
call the victory pricing where

587
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,620
new I across a

588
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,420
network low you promise

589
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,430
highest he that there are the product is
Peter

590
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,440
a cost to the rotting closer

591
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,980
and by furniture for a non a

592
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,670
around long Quan game standpoint dole
available

593
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,880
the rules on route I saying actually
Maher yes

594
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,100
but can be something on the trade credit
for stores

595
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,770
over Bama course or something on talk
about

596
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:12,770
used yes

597
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:17,359
other wall premiums what's the

598
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:24,359
problem scale

599
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,270
okay

600
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,630
and Fisher routing protocols down a
proposed

601
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,500
while that is that your local homes

602
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,180
I know that where you are national
further out

603
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,549
new arrive here we are at that very
often network

604
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:47,130
always know that you're ok so you don't
maintain

605
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,020
her brother you can't increase law you
know exactly when it was on the FBI

606
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,440
we lack of desire out for those who put
it there official I

607
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,730
as prior permission very clear expire

608
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,910
cloud over well purposely around very
bad

609
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,920
now there are

610
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,530
a algorithms what okay and the article
core

611
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,760
their 100 can take apart and Russell

612
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,750
workers that thing arm love 2001

613
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,309
a this in a few offers should be awful
all

614
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:25,289
while for down were busiest here for all
the

615
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:30,720
that a anyway hypercube mesh routing

616
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,599
people here across years it with the

617
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,480
tasted me cue that resorts Holiday Inn
across the network

618
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,569
here tried to you surfer is a day that

619
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:46,558
it looks at the the Hamming distance
after they are looking for

620
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,400
Asha day on local here the routes for a
law

621
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,069
and treated canceling break down to one
day

622
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:57,410
that's good then search prosecutors

623
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,690
you for all so wrong but novel on top

624
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,710
made from

625
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,950
in a traffic

626
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,660
as in service prior very much hope your
West up

627
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,529
or look thruster

628
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:19,059
a anyway you have traffic traditional
way

629
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:22,660
doing marcia up traffic across

630
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,520
our call was on modeling basically it's
a

631
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,579
about what happened at the prodding
happening in the next

632
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:35,089
and set yeah program so on Thursday my
back

633
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:39,828
and there's thirteen people have you and
you expect one person at a show of

634
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:43,900
a so I people in that special

635
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,119
one right a

636
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,740
for example persona let's say you're and
the bank and also

637
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,510
thousand people show up like want again
for was probably never special

638
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,940
an extra one I mean it's a possible

639
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,230
problem is though a

640
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,200
people didn't you use my own design you
know rubber buffers

641
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,540
is about design a

642
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,350
link passive measurement everything
itself is one of her that

643
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,490
network traffic is gonna be yeah exactly
nombres de

644
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,640
non yet very protective over issues

645
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,310
across all scales so hearsay you know
you're trapped sample

646
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,370
you see something like this

647
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:33,200
if you look ever doubt there's ever a

648
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,290
I'll fire under my

649
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,690
far north side a look at five

650
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:46,680
you know you know that a by seven hold

651
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,470
there are five seconds if the load
smoother

652
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:55,730
and

653
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:01,230
a you look at a a lot I still get
efficiency is with us we're

654
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,930
that case reason why truck birthday

655
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:11,169
artificial a suspect because multimedia
traffic by furnitures fractal

656
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,410
race also or after compression their
summer sessions now they're

657
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,080
paper came out was your last goodbye
both very much true

658
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,069
isn't TCP by its very nature haha
structures also

659
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,200
because the way the just a little you
block

660
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,460
you throttle that once the but back from
in

661
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,330
your best technology start playing to
your local bar style

662
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:39,880
Alonso that cause a person's and so I
this paper published 94

663
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,270
by so morning 160

664
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,730
point for happened I'll it

665
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:50,730
on all auto long-range dependency

666
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,350
traffic

667
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,529
anyway this another sample

668
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,560
solid saying they are recessed yeah

669
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,740
structural but rather somewhere

670
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,740
research structure the Internet April
change

671
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,710
I of people new model one last saw

672
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,480
bracing for a me a lot rather

673
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,860
no imagery here then again i OS update
comes out

674
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,300
you apply immediately no scares

675
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,160
now manga into a croatian

676
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,980
between majored in you help us Iowa

677
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,610
reason while I'll

678
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,730
girl the next two weeks people on ok
well routers

679
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:43,730
not you but what this me

680
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,550
a some force so

681
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:52,080
climb or so on no it wasn't

682
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,230
doing at an Iowa con el

683
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,760
be an awful time to launch

684
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,840
a large buildup I'll

685
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,870
for those now a measured out there doing
work

686
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,290
the love of God I

687
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,250
abroad like route flap boy the up
without

688
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,660
router you know we just backup

689
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,049
importation yardley that switches

690
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,680
you ever thought about you

691
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,509
make people great break for me if you
make sure you have it

692
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,840
his follow so if there are any questions
or

693
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:39,840
on it download

694
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:53,950
a

695
00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:00,950
yeah

696
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,520
are

697
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,619
luck with that but a what exactly is

698
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:13,010
you know to question a router buildings
electric bills

699
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:19,190
and heroes make his worst comes to worst
I think it became a national security

700
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,670
issue

701
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,430
if you have a go down I think I really
don't think that

702
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,770
I mean it real possibility bud

703
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,020
other governor really like that

704
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,800

708
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,030

709
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,230
Jonah you see trading stop

710
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,440
Louise Bourgoin danger

711
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,710
the article here

712
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,900
same thing in Europe

713
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,600

719
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,580
exactly it it the lingo so it's

720
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,720
is a perfect example and I think that it
again as

721
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,010
as you know what other things that are
covered other times I think they're

722
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:43,490
gonna

723
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,430
