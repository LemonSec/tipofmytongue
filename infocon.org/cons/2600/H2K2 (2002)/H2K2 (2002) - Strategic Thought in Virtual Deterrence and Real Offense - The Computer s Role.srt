00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,740
add as we discussed this subject we're
going to bring up a number of issue

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,789

security in their own is useless we need

58
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:52,810
to have to see should security and
that's achieved if you translate

what's interesting is

00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,400
pre-christmas

101
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,300

slightly overlapping this pre-christmas
to push history

106
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,169
was a fine physical tax attorney

107
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:17,419
and information text

108
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:18,680
just four theories

109
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,480
the chance for fear is devoted to the
justification

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,529
health-wise

111
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,960
was our fault

112
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,549
the justification i could be theoretical
or historical

113
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,430
the theoretical aspects look at how to
basically justifiable

114
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,020
and forms of water

115
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,799
was the historical aspect

116
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,949
looks at international treaties rules
and agreements

big-city types sheet

118
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,060
except their own

119
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,530
it just east of more help to justify
engaging in tool

120
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,739
and you seemed a little just unfair
competitive

121
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:49,830
and now we see the criteria is that day

122
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,070
and we see lead just falls competent
authority and so on

123
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,659
but at the back at the bottom receive
peaceable total success inc talented and

124
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,309
we have to ask yourself

125
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,689
would we be information operations

126
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:07,319
what do we have a reasonable hope of
success and what its promotional team

127
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,629
and bummed misled received one of the
issues the responsibilities that to

128
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,099
accomplish the mission

129
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:14,370
fight and win

130
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,639
but even if we don't have a doctrine for
information operations we don't really

131
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,729
know how to find

132
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,359
nor do we know how to win

133
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:24,219
and the often you'll see from the
chessboard tradition

134
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,989
we need need to be mexico

135
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:30,340
civilian casualties but how are we going
to limit civilian casualties

136
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,679
effete might have weapon systems

137
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:39,009
which companies criminal between
combatants and non-combatants

138
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:40,710
solutions for the section

139
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,080
again he'd like to know your thoughts on
these tom

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,900
incessant some months after the
presentation

141
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,979
for this section of issues of our
traditional and contemporary motions

142
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,050
strategy

143
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,869
sufficient to understand information
operations and

144
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,279
and have been analyzing strategic terms

145
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,729
the asymmetry threats

146
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,438
notions what individual

147
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,830
or organization which sell for example

148
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,820
being disproportionate powerful

149
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,729
should you choose to live

150
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:11,310
an exception is virtually terms i was
struck by an examination of just what is

151
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,739
virtually turns how's it different

152
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,860
defense

153
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,709
you negotiate

154
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,929
virtually terms

155
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:24,259
for a purely defensive measures such
spirals who really remarks

156
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,240
fear factor potential adversary

157
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,389
but they will not wish to taqman

158
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,809
and respecting

159
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:33,979
people responded

160
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,438
responsible for defending networks are
flooded with dan rutz fred hickman

161
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,240
abilities and so on

162
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,059
and was a false positives idea says

163
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,069
so that we have to moscow itself

164
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:47,199
how can they maintain dileep vigilance

165
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,419
certain such an environment is different
but mostly meaningless and other

166
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:58,419
and also ask yourself how can the
military government do the same

167
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:00,900
retaliation

168
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,019
euthanasia status attack by cyber
attacks

169
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:09,439
doesn't need to respond with virtual
certainty hundreds because different

170
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,299
means

171
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:13,169
being conventional means being non
conventional

172
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,998
which can be weapons of mass destruction
weapons of mass destruction

173
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,580
also there's another problem usually

174
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,000
how are you going to support the origin
of the attack because sometimes the card

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,150
and you don't want to

176
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,549
sheet back at the wrong nation

177
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,129
also there are other issues

178
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,230
response maybe stomp military

179
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,980
information operation

180
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,440
but keep in touch

181
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,180
circumstances luigi information
operations

182
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,760
then answers will be aware of the sinn
fein will not return from just shoot

183
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,720
performs publications

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,980
okay some general background

185
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,750
she's for students dual use technology
to come into play here

186
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,610
uh... is generally cheaper if done
properly it's cheaper to keep repeating

187
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,250
into practice

188
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,080
uh... the schemes advantage to much of
an organization

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,590
most of the party

190
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,790
if done properly

191
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,180
there's the cancellation workfare threat

192
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,050
if two major governments

193
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,060
organizations wish to make agreements

194
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,959
not to attack the germans uncertainty

195
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,549
logical methods they making those there
some history inventor protocols in place

196
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:27,240
how do you want me to greensboro
individuals were sells personal

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,190
you may not be back

198
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,230
uh... also we have the doctor
strangelove

199
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,110
uh... information operation

200
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,580
tactics strategies and methods negro
endangers the present

201
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,730
and look at some point so workers armed

202
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,750
were announced plans reduction

203
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,410
or control treatments

204
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,569
i mean come on that's his concern

205
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,970
patient interest

206
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,360
the issues

207
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,750
for uh... for the sections his preston
something to consider status

208
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,870
mother and one was a student and you
should

209
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,880
that computer based information tax

210
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,870
really kind of

211
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,700

214
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,450
here premise my b day

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,060
before june successful attack attack
weight and style

216
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,240
if you think you can we do tacking on
discovery

217
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,740
what's going to keep him from doing this

218
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,090
to accept the networks truman protected

219
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,700
twisters was trying to protect networks
would not be sitting on the months

220
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,600

227
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,450
civics lesson that russian soldier who
fought against napoleon's army huge

228
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,490
expense and he had extensive combat
experience

229
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,900
and you really fought for the first time
at the age of thirteen

230
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,630
these led to the writing of the
important book on strategy called funky

231
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,200
get

232
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,530
which is a classic most of the southwest
of strategic thought which looks at the

233
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,889
human to human strategic problems

234
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,890
and hence he's very kindness

235
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,770
one of the aspects because of the
mentioned was the center of gravity the

236
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,579
focal point of the country's power
during the war

237
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,470
as strategic level

238
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,629
these needed to be teeth

239
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,300
declined because

240
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,250
to have to correct military objectives
nowadays defeat look at virtual and real

241
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,130
centrist parties we have put more
targets more possible targets

242
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,890
and we have to moscow itself

243
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,470
will be going to target that repeated
military what abt economic system would

244
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,970
it be the political system and so on

245
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,170

by performing this vast be concept

is that you can act

259
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,140
fast nothing official

260
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,170
enough to get inside within the
constraints of the admissions decisions

261
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,040
moved back in our brain

efficiently inactive

making respond if you do this and to
maintain prefix refer to the temple

264
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,620

computer network operations subset of
the information operations

268
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,730
he took three parts of it

269
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,060
one being computer networks for the
patients when one looks at the bottom of

270
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,690
the leading exploits

271
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,990
he's in the inner cities into things

272
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,510
one being computer network attacks

273
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,230
we attacked an enemies computer system

274
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,810
and try to interrupt this information
flow corruptly statements on most of the

275
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,959
same time

276
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,750
you will be conducting computer network
defense

277
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,800
we tried to

278
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,140
defamed networks within the attacks

279
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,890
is strategy

280
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,170
air supremacy versus information
supremacy

281
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,040
whose worksheet for people

282
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,980
people's what we see now a days stay so
was a gap between technology dot

283
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,560
in other words doctrine

284
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,639
tries to catch up with technology

285
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,359
for example looking at their strategy
during the fiscal lol

286
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:47,470
please personally use that the people
didn't really know how to use them

287
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,400
efficiently

288
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,640
the military way

289
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,340
and then we have met strategies like
great trenches to stop at the developing

290
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,970
had doctrine and so on

291
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,550
which led to the strategic bombing
campaign in the second world war

292
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,960
but then afterwards we we send a man to
the moon

293
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,210
but peter this long we've been asked to
cheat their supremacy the concept

294
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,170
development warden which was
successfully used through the whole fool

295
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,170
so in other words people take time to
develop and i knew a doctrine

296
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,660
as the estimate the only beginning

297
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,060
special information operation

298
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,390
is to find a special information
operations are information operations

299
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,460
there

300
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,280
but it seems it is major and if you to
david broder usually fitzco impact

301
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,300
security requirements or a student age
national security of the u_s_ requiring

302
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,999
a special review and approvals process
they can be confirmed

303
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,620
and perhaps the three sometimes

304
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,740
with a solution

305
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,360
he's s items from other operations

306
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,110
items would be class

307
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,090

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,430
we're talking about actions mean for
example from computer other methods

316
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,490
if you ask what is now saying oh

317
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,920
the incident publicized some
speculations involved something it's

318
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,269
unreasonable would be

319
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:27,070
example infiltrating an adversary spot
military command control networks

320

things can be risky and include some sir

324
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,400
means two things i think that matters

325
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,860
student states

326
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,740

nature part of the proceedings

328
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,010
it's very important to governments
especially

329
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,269
sliding more more monitors too

330
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:01,110
training lessons collateral damage

monarch mets vs not met

332
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,580

complex infrastructures for intelligence

334
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,040
these are gone forever to attitude
reasons besides one but there's no

335
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,630

338
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,990
there's another issue

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,730
union intrinsic

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,520

341
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,180
pandora's box

342
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,240
a few days ago

343
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,630
attended

344
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,030
presentation by someone from the
military force to be sir

345
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,170
information operations are really great
to see a cheat

346
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,839
we instead of the industry's results
when

347
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,790
when we find him once fifty by new ones
but information operations began just

348
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,640
houston over and over again this week a
cheap

349
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,920
but that's not true

350
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,200
as we face two problems with volume
slipped out of the pope's first of all

351
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,379
we use the element of surprise

352
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:02,540
as the enemy is able to analyze our
attack

353
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,560
furthermore he might even be able to
make more advanced attack based on our

354
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,960
attack or not onto our system

355
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,280
in addition to that means the end of the
country intelligence the second point

356
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,520
which was mentioned already but just
what the early eighties

357
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,639
how to really needs ideo

358
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,200
because ideal might not be able to
distinguish between combat pins

359
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,380
non-combatants and nowadays we do not
want to have civilian casualties at all

360
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,640
if possible

361
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,790
i think there's a photo of the ocean
future

362
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,230
was unlawful

363
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,630
there is intrinsic reluctance to clear

364
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,880
inching toward is that if animation

365
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,310

it may not wish to do the same

368
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,660
especially not with promoting conflict

369
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,419
because its potential

370
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:54,700

solutions

428
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,410
and nation states even if they don't
want to wage offensive i hear what they

429
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,260
would have to consider it and look at it
because the a new attitude

430
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,190
and he needs to know what the enemy's
going to do

431
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,760
also any government which would not
located not they've been very wise

432
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,920
in addition to that we have to look
doctrine at the moment is not fully

433
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,929
understood

434
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:43,260
no realize

435
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,390
let me go to

436
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,870
but before looking at the air campaign
strategy and so on

437
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,550
we have to look at it was difficult for
him to develop a at doctrine for

438
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,510

439
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,890
rules that have been on my message
center for the subjects do you expect

440
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,300
will say that it made a mistake anyone
is interested in nyc discussing feel

441
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,210
free

442
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,060
and the book and you see any form of
warfare must be underpinned by real

443
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,799
understanding of the enemy

444
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,160
which brings us back to even if you
don't want to wage a fancy five-year-old

445
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,419
you will have to

446
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,460

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,850

scandal of the safe side of the dead in
the rooms around the corner

451
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
but this is not really true

452
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,220
physical attacks is still more powerful
than any cyber attacks

453
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,870

and that's basically the station

513
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,789
would like to thank you and we didn't do
it and have some uh...

along with a number of things you can't

526
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,090

531
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,769
testing

532
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:34,690
after practice

533
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,820
well forcible only

534
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,928
world is a difference between some
information both in international

535
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:41,070
relations

536
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,730
information or face the mold computer
warfare but for me doesn't mean i think

537
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,560
that just a moment

538
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,120
yet but some sweet kid he's a little
something you just playing around and

539
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,590
poking around

540
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:59,590
but i don't consider it to be an
informational

541
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,760
campaigns rich as

542
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,529

primary

544
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,320
so that we need to have to developing
countries bilities the chinese a

545
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,639
well-known definite lots of strategies
and everything

546
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,840
everything we read in the media

547
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,370
it's mostly teenagers having fun

548
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,259
maybe

549
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,450
onto the internet

550
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,230
may need a chinese a primary issue c

551
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,090

00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:33,529
to conduct reconnaissance or whatever

554
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:35,820
but that's just the assumption that i
don't know

555
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,239
biosystems more

556
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,870
governments to come up

557
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,410
investigations

558
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,780
popping it's no problem isn't it

559
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,139
the sixties project

560
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,240
missus will consent

561
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,149
was more concerned

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,620
unusual subject others

563
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,580

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,899
we're going to be inspection

pastor

567
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,940
got two questions and

568
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,140
respondents could you comment on

569
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,390
warfare against

570
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,220
urine treatment

571
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,990
justifiable

572
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,890
odds of making it substance that victims
are not innocent victims

573
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,550
kills

574
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,610
and benefits

575
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,950
comment on

576
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,029
control of all

577
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:30,270
that's paranoia about commenting about
things and so i think people

578
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,510
because they made hundreds of people to
act one of the great fear is that i have

579
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,970
accepted into an eloquent statesman
suspicious any commenting because so

580
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,570
much about people being turned out
americans commenting

581
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:50,570
what if you do see something to you come

582
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,820
regardless of the issue

583
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:00,820
warfare

584
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,700

585
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,510
pictures from holland

586
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,720
interesting ah... ah...

587
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,870
for us

588
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,600
you're talking about his alleged
conflicts

589
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,169
which is very interesting to me and that
is

590
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:33,260
if you look at major looked at the u_s_

591
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,210
military it's that this plane tickets
available

592
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,140
that forces selection worked there is no
other soul

advancement defense industry

595
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,180
so you're basically

596
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,080
forcing your adversary to you

597
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,899
to perform terrorist acts to make
intended

598
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,010
there's lots of love

599
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,220
what that means

600
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,470
information whatever suppose

601
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,280

623
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,620

that except for the defense

629
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:34,470
different theoretical point of view but
decimal point of view of

630
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,240
and i think it will work well for

00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,090
of tax experience rather

632
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,610

637
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,070
that you could say in his

make it would be the

643
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,560
these i said like uh... content strategy
before

644
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,870
when you're in town we don't really have

policy you can't do anything more

648

it's huge it's useless in her

649
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,740
and first of all we need to do

650
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:35,740
communities need to get down there

worthless romancing the cuban coast
flamenco

666
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,360
we are saying is that we take a matter
of time in decades large sums of money

667
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,640
for this realized potential look real
nice to have been used effectively

668
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:26,640
on minor from sworn virgins asian
perspective but from uh... i don't

669
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,010
can you think

670
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,399
reluctant samples alike

671
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,790
it's actually

672
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:38,149
think sorry

673
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,559
on concrete beyond that we must

674
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,889
anything i really media it's own i don't
see that information operations beyond
