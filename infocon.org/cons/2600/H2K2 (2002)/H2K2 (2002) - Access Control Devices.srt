1
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:04,310
says

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,480
yes centuries on the way

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,559
probably outstanding physical security
sales

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,680
already drive by there with us we have
no I'll have no videos

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,698
we don't have any

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,000
from room my

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
them on their money

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,370
they wanted I Michael Glasser

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,879
on access control specialist from I

10
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,390
going on um my mom and factors
referenced that match officials treeline

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,530
southern New Jersey

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,580
I had a lot of new york on the
manufacturer's website electrical

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,600
installations but

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,089
if anyone has questions at the end they
can be freed on my left is

15
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:04,110
Isaac with all he's Isaac I'm

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,750
home he is Isaac I get to play vanna
white today

17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,220
yeah go who dela peña the luckiest

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,420
love Lucky's up a special birthday

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:23,270
well we love him 5 by the wrong okay

20
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,470
first things access control is why you
hard

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,910
more letters control go back to the
games Yemen or

22
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,210
10 keep people in an hour excellence

23
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,540
the building of the people and now the
building he has joined or

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,870
is vicki was good but you can hold it
for anything he he goes off in the base

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,270
happy

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,140
then people starred on master key
systems which was also good because

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,140
you put the key that they need to just
talkin attendees

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,690
nauseated though anyone you know my mask
is associate head

29
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,509
especially other home well as good %uh

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,430
so basically for anyone who doesn't know
master key system is just one key

31
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,830
control a loss I we will have different
levels a supervisory

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,489
you have a user key then perhaps a
supervisor quixote

33
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,060
maintenance key then you have a master
key to look all the buildings cetera et

34
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,730
cetera basically broken down on

35
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,730
needs K

36
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,969
by what he sent out front only Marcus
and is that all the people think it

37
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:33,760
kinky is

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,819
are two locks work on the same key at
master he

39
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,980
that is a master key what that means is
that the key to lock

40
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,450
just walkin sign a bill to say a master
key system work could be that

41
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,310
one locking were two separate keys
completely tito little kids

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,620
that might in

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,379
move for example you might have once the
hotel

44
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,429
you might have a floor master for the
May

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,609
reached floor might have a grand mess a
great Grandmaster any

46
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:07,010
during the entire building you up with
another key email

47
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,108
a key for the job only ones all
janitor's closet sorry for causing one

48
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,659
possible way of doing it is or has
published essentially you have multiple

49
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,019
pins the neat stack can you in you can't

50
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,849
in three months ago 18 you walk the
downside of course is

51
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:27,329
is more where that and more kisses from
me thinking a lot because so many more

52
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,090
possible she like that locus

53
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,370
well as though he said

54
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,200
so any available slots that's right any
bool Oxford lopping palomar

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,700
a minimum balance every okay

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,209
well without as he said so now you've
got the door

57
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,640
you've got a lot of good he's eleven
allow users and

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,230
I'll just pass by each other one there
was a party dress far-right

59
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,250
like it then don't as although still

60
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,329
months so well know where I was

61
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,900
okay have a door leading to secure and
then some guidance I literally is cool

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,480
so the subject control systems because
it's almost sure the locket picture

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,079
keep enjoying a break in the more like
that stuff but realistically

64
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,250
anything get broken but it more special
is more colleges I'll tell you

65
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,050
therefore we have access control first
day of the show you

66
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,139
is basic basic basic basic basic got
substantial

67
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,440
at-bat why keep bed because of that

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,469
hard on that that he left the venue what
are doing

69
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,090
below and walk through the door

70
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,470
and it works for the long haul the lower
the keep it in a sense of it all

71
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:50,200
online yet the flat big we love lies the
key so drained

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,669
is the well as good as a key
battleground

73
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,760
the keypad wanna be shown is called I

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,080
writer a

75
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,849
see why we bring him debt not thinking
about that

76
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,350
okay II I is international something
something

77
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,060
problem I work for them I mentioned up
but

78
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,760
no was arrested up before publishing
this just so that

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,530
so I T I is international it strikes a
chord

80
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,870
and think and

81
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,700
they may keep pets and they may access
control systems and now they make a

82
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,020
stand alone door lock which can fit my
car

83
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,609
because I'm a room and mostly their
focus is access control

84
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,480
a harbor such as keypads and proximity
readers mag stripe readers

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,840
smart card readers arm a backlit keypad
this

86
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,090
control health patrol all so for those
kids to set up a time for

87
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:57,090
of was the second

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,960
about

89
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,060
up

90
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,270
I want this this is that ok well I

91
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,289
to 12 I'll probably

92
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,340
I have to say the everyone in the whole
world

93
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,160
does access as you this might be Louis
on something but

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,890
its previous close and I i 212 keypad II

95
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,500
looks like this was crossing like boxing
you are sort of a little while

96
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,430
on using it credit which game works
basically what this does

97
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,360
is it's a switch with the key Pendleton

98
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,260
stores up to 120 users a punch in the
code below open the door

99
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,610
early accessible everyone going to Home
Depot and go in advance of the crosscut

100
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,170
saw

101
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,180
you are going to see all the budget one
two three four star

102
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,660
and I've New York cuts good s

103
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,220
mindset Home Depot guys go on 2003
four-star I'm

104
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,330
its up to get on the ball guys I was
told that a program that

105
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,090
but yeah as a group of all it is

106
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,810
still it still hoped the authorizes the
Home Depot guy writes the code on things

107
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,710
president the matter what it is larger
than the Azalea

108
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,780
lockpicking yes or no Hana bank vault
really

109
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,740
as other the vault other friend of mine
so on the banks of that spills

110
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,370
on though it was very there was a
retired

111
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,690
The Daily Show shank good question yes
which bank I'm not answer that one

112
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,450
the bank with among other that so do
twelve-day make three different posture

113
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:47,140
oz was really got into it

114
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,510
the national other

115
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,550
we offer right now but okay %uh played
on

116
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,690
why does that matter is more betterer

117
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,120
okay

118
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,960
another Awlaki are realistically I don't

119
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,460
and there had need for I've read to the
home and will probably a hundred times

120
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:16,460
you generally when used as for long
keypad to be more like this keypad

121
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,930
and this will be used on it or
contracting

122
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,160
at was well as I was about to a get up
to this the to throw line

123
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,170
like this is just a switch if you once
were the two screws out

124
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,659
you can shorten the wires over the door
and that's the reason why it matters:

125
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,640
yeah has gotten I'll get there was then

126
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,780
answer exactly that's why the to follow
the one love guys use in 10 days

127
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,880
as for I had years ago

128
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,430
I that okay

129
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,410
hit by FEMA and

130
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,680
your ear

131
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,940
he had

132
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,410
yet I played

133
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:11,370
very never with the first

134
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,800
yeah you greatly Kelly

135
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,500
right hot with chain here

136
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,560
with it would relate front

137
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,880
bring vertical

138
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,710
holiday right wanted yet

139
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,470
what you get work where

140
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,940
the rain he all like

141
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,050
and me I can remember me

142
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,260
net make know she'll never leave the
south

143
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,120
little laundry little yes yep

144
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,930
but the the advantage is a system like
that is that if you're happenings be

145
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,650
escorts on our own building

146
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,850
your using these key ps2 walkthrough
doors

147
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,870
the person on only has the look at your
fingers as Buddhism upper left that must

148
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,610
be your one

149
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,340
who is in the lower right that must be
an online can figure it out that way

150
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,700
the other advantage is that in a very
high traffic situation

151
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,250
the numbers were aware of those keys
which I'm sure

152
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,590
wrong healing look at these sorts of
things so you know if the numbers to do

153
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,400
for seven and five

154
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,550
are missing what are the chances that
too

155
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,970
475 are somewhere in this Go so that's
not to love

156
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,160
means in jail me

157
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Mitchell hopefully they'll short out
before it's a big problem

158
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,300
thinking I have seen on personally I'm
what this one is just the eye model

159
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,369
indoor basic keypad mom got was drawn
out but very much does

160
00:10:56,369 --> 00:11:00,980
gonna what about wanna you now you

161
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,300
anomaly with me to the rest because one
really uses in that situation been

162
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,589
3.0 I come back from that we miss you

163
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:13,420
yeah to

164
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,050
on mobile a dress code is going to do is
going to inform someone who recognizes

165
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,639
it that something is going wrong

166
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,350
under the right conditions but if you're
in an unmarked

167
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,179
in a non-monetary facility in all you're
doing is trying to protect the door to

168
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,209
say data center

169
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:34,929
there's not going to be some guy sitting
all day long looking for certainly in

170
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,189
page someone else

171
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:39,779
but at that point it's the on girls
minutes K

172
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,259
that turns the Hohner of its just a
smidge well as a switch it's not a stern

173
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,459
it's not for anything but this which I
put these on doors inside the office

174
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,009
buildings

175
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:52,259
because that way the cook couldn't get
to the other costs of

176
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,299
it's not a scaredy it's not for anything
but just a switch there's three

177
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,259
different families

178
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,350
alone for now but we'll never get a
minute the a.m

179
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,429
2 12's

180
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:07,809
2 32's and secures 212 just switch

181
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:13,730
232 is eighty had a stand-alone bill has
inside brains

182
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,129
so tricky bit of the one cancelled out
don't do anything

183
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:21,389
basically transmit signal to the inside
brains it's a joint series just and low

184
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,029
key pair that has now put four

185
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:26,959
the brain somewhere on the building that
without that a while this is the %ah

186
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,869
inside usage exxon into a single gang
boss

187
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:34,509
those jobs are they love them seen
everywhere in the city what's up

188
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:39,119
a lot harder now any of these people can
be on any of the three families to 12 to

189
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:39,759
32

190
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,759
or security reasons so anything you see
here on the old one occasion

191
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,610
can tell by looking at it didn't
actually this one can't it's not really

192
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,089
in the back

193
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:52,089
but in as on is fine means for them

194
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:57,169
I'm hoping orange about a baller

195
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:00,230
undergo two worlds Jordan the store the

196
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,439
cue 15 15 in 15 looks like that

197
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:07,899
plus a barrel up enough to see anything
I'll

198
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,700
Trans Am Yahoo who

199
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,710
if you look real close it's gotta

200
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,650
put out the song so is due in Burmese
threatening the back the electric

201
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,310
buttons

202
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,560
here so there's no actual moving party
with a hammer last year others are

203
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,410
hardened up

204
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,829
but the last lights and super also great
plastic from somewhere

205
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,540
on the bottom but I'm a job it's not
hard you can read it

206
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,780
and inside here get a little me out blue
a

207
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,890
think we are and the term on certain
number

208
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,360
and 12 of people's things as up which
one can you put that thing there's a

209
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,030
down

210
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,970
day getting a meanie tender think
everybody probably see that somewhere

211
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,320
on something and once you get all four
you get it open

212
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,400
and guess what send the signal little
probably open

213
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,870
that's right same left to secure one day
and said %uh something where the number

214
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,840
the council rotate

215
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,180
that way they can tell letter-writing
fun but numbers

216
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,640
and hit up and down up and down the
block to know what you doing

217
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,750
nothing at the office if they lose
insist that other movie all the cable is

218
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,790
the only time to pushing it

219
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,250
was a really good like some on people
you're probably

220
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,150
responses to look the other way and to
this is for

221
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,370
Isaac I'll be

222
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,520
and I was like no other day school not
even remember that that is OK

223
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,079
and the like this at all these key pad
to be in any other forms

224
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,840
%uh somebody up there time I'm going to
like fifty-five minutes and

225
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,690
its own medicine I'll we're gonna go
faster now cause I figured we would give

226
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,680
us on our

227
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,190
but other than that hit by several some
festive this big thing here

228
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,990
is the are for rugged dust it's a break

229
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,110
its heaviest metal its gotta keep bad

230
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,500
it's a break outgrow that it will go out

231
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,660
it's broke it's made for outside use are
you put these on the who's next

232
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,819
I will drive the truck and yet it that
they had to Indo

233
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,340
but this there and it day and if you
know the truck doesn't break

234
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,310
that it is more hospital all was vandals
Asian

235
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,610
well only with me because this is far as
I know

236
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,770
one fire only factor I mean real fire
over there I'll I don't do this while

237
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,150
her

238
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,260
but if you submit a balanced

239
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,939
thought that a a super good bugs

240
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,760
that'll stop this if you paid over the
bottoms are based on those details on

241
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,319
the bed

242
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,740
aristotle's rise ago on two or three
four five six star about

243
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,110
I and that's the of

244
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:47,000
I think this

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,820
is the acts T extremely

246
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:58,520
haha they were smart once again no
moving parts in a hamlet last year

247
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,490
was it the LED it the only the only
breaks the muscle

248
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,990
know how hard to push that they need a
cozy turbines

249
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,990
wear the veil and there's no no you do
medals Asian that's really not nice

250
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,150
officer responded as I make my own

251
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,949
nigga month a

252
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:26,950
yeah but is all scratchy

253
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,090
18 illegally being raised by the got a
stainless steel

254
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,350
me if you just a joke to it that'll
David if you take a whole so to where

255
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:36,850
they were

256
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,850
probably some kinda massamilla much
about that now that is meant

257
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,610
know more about them that you have that
on the show after I personally think the

258
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,460
piece of crap but luckily the phasing
out of the cycle model

259
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,340
scrap but whatever source all that's
good 11

260
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,380
so that no moving parts the st. and

261
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,380
thats damn good though this was all over
this economic is the one class to face

262
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,810
Southwest member im I personally think
this is probably hope from the fight me

263
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,490
for saying all

264
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:15,109
on books but all I don't like it it
wears out to publish a pencil box below

265
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,510
to hear things you think a lot of people
do you hold it

266
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,700
it wears out in braids but once they're
just have seen while I was in for 10

267
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,270
years

268
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,129
they are called me up and said out which
is both a member I looked at him and

269
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,590
said

270
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,840
here about seven years overdue but I
think este

271
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,620
is a very good keep it for what they had
it was cheap it was good but outsiders

272
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,380
weber froze

273
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,430
because I think I was just uses anymore
now we have a new weather broke even

274
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,590
limbo land pollution control we got this

275

279
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,360
a lot of noise about the show on the
test of

280
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,960
this is the the I'll

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,510
think that but I am its hermetically
sealed would be

311
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,600
think that's what I'm looking for a lot
yes question

312
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,640
yep

313
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,090
there are cause for everything if you
program the man

314
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,830
initially a factory code is want to hold
three fourths

315
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,370
are if you don't take that out I'm gonna
have to make fun of you

316
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,320
other than that anything you don't
programming is not in there there's no

317
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,929
factory bypass kurds

318
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,980
I love if you're ripping off the wall

319
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,580
you not get very far storms here is your
best bet those in the back door

320
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,870
and power down when the power back up
there is a way to get back at the sacred

321
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,430
on power down and power up both the
system throughout about how that

322
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,090
yup

323
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,480
depends on which model using on like

324
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,890
the other 2 12's the richest and 11 it's
short of the wire with no its want to

325
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,130
believe our top 10

326
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,430
master program mode on the arm not only

327
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,380
and she's not guilty by

328
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,160
ombre but on the other hand back power
time they get to those also estimate

329
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,420
that might also offer

330
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:19,420

you're happy but most the time and give
them the software let them do their own

412
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,670

also keep head proximity readers usually
built into here

429
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,230
why this doesn't have one it because you

the outside adjust your set up

434
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,520
is to be stand-alone or integrate into
that system in stand-alone mode of two

435
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,600

490
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,710
well-wishers yeah that obliges

491
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,930
again at one stop portal is like to the
battery died and their ballot that sorry

492
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,750
charles is on a new one for the last
like five years but we've been testing

493
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,680
this one every day demo you the whole
time

494
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,120
I just bought a big plus a blessing this
is called Eliquis

495
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,480
I have done for full price training on
the shit I'm rather than me this job

496
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,350
so I won't give any false information
side yeah

497
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,910
anyone's lawyers law so the more the
Saunders

498
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,430
was on the street on Moore's Law that
the war is over they also make room

499
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,160
Saunders

500
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,360
the way this works is on the front the
lead there is in for a little be

501
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,020
anything he

502
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,560
can communicate with the key which has
information inside it

503
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,950
powers of the key communicates and the
key is program with a chip in it

504
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,980
that he had no cuts in and as stated you
do only had one from there is a visible

505
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,860
there in the spring hold in place

506
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,070
so this is an accident roses new
director for the whole apartment

507
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,919
building with to throw the morn Saunders

508
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,440
tell the whole lot the backing from that
big but a lot of the answer

509
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,510
um I believe it's Kennedy Airport that
uses on everyone over gays and maybe

510
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,030
maybe JFK LaGuardia

511
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,250
I all the time I think it can be done
either using among all the gates

512
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,840
because need something a stand-alone
where you can swap program in to walk

513
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,310
away

514
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,409
you have audit K which means you are up
to in sticky n

515
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,860
result the last 100 want not what the
transactions

516
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,120
pullout say that you back your computer
weather then

517
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,180
I'll give you all the transactions and
owns it it's a very very good system

518
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,810
it's very very cost-effective I can't I
get pricing because because we were

519
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:49,379
from like me found it but when he got
the lead loving friend three

520
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,200
good question its a deeply up a lot of
broken

521
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,530
take a temperature loss I less but
turkey and all the way

522
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,270
high output all that often do the right
thing

523
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,570
between the anybody front like a and the
lock

this bright indeed this process called
by a script that was the most popular

577
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,970
biometric readers out there

578
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,040
you all probably seen that jus de los
Santos from the lowest it all and then

home size: I wanna comment on

581
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,960
what that is that's hand the geometry
its composer proper have that class on

size your fingers and let the fingers

584
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,089
and become a figure of it

585
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:56,200
calif.-based think that the following
days

586
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,420
all the wall in left more likely at the
other end so the only closely match

587
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:00,750

let think get that that but that's it

593
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,419
yeah I'm waitin for the plugin for
continuous I guess

594
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:27,530

why use it one convenience y'all have
karaoke with you

603
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,700
independent application now with that
activity

604

well that with that little day that's
the by a script that the past we get

645
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,740
details on what does what mean it

646
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,740
have no idea where I was when I will
that's the stuff

647
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,050
New York City I'm from Jersey and get
his one-time only if you think that will

648
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,690
you die

649
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,890
present for ages something as a

650
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:56,580
what something completely off the wall
detain him but

651
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,940
absolutely nothing but the screw but to
know the info you have no the weekend

652
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,840
output format

653
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,930
they are we in the end I can do that
which is committed 26 that number or

654
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,680
higher depending on which just musing

655
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,810
are showing us of our honey bits it is

656
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:16,110
I use is like five by J digit serial
number you guys do the math after three

657
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,060
tries it times out of ten minutes on my
system

658
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,200
so you get three tries and then you have
to wait a minute stretch i'd the matter

659
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,940
how long it takes before sinn after
Fabio

660
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,270
another actually

661
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,200
this is a multi connector for display
purpose on what this does is you have

662
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,370
I A we get up with an awesome Rs 45 a
programming I'll

663
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:45,370
that sounds like a dumb and Hawaiian are
you can cancel these bars too valuable

664
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,400
to the softer

665
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,740
but you not be able to integrate with an
access control system largely 32 as far

666
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,250
as I know

667
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:58,250
to beat it if you can get the out
without a doubt I'd like to see it I

668
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,080
personally could

692
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,320
programming only so you need 45

693
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,360
program it and your plugin for Peter of
or he's walking to the front to talk

697
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,330
okay the best up to 100 users

698
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:54,390
only work as much as your finger call
the one too many return don't ask me why

699
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,640
that's my boss told me

700
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,730
honestly other why they call one too
many it's up to two hundred years is the

701
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,850
key thing I don't be

702
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,700
we will implement the lobby region

that's it send the output it doesn't
know you that it sends a red light

704

if it does not mean but the green light
that's it

705
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,970

put your finger on and updated mineral

711
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:39,280
yeah because it was a good for you think
I don't know

712
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,250
inmates are like president

713
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,830
Bud Light if you go to

714
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:51,250
compusa in RadioShack any interest on
the city I don't want to be

715
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,730
a hey look at that I wanna be abolished
you can buy there's nothing buy compact

716
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,270
that's a mouse with a fingerprint reader

717
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,290
every loss because a hundred boxing is
to get there now lack of security

718
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,070
that I can say that but he said they saw

719
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,710
I can say that but I happened to
possibly I can see bomb

720
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,080
they sample attended 15 months after
finger

721
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,100
am if you missed out on my butt and
that's how they work

722
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:21,230
I if you go to the finger those 10 to 15
points may very well be killed

723
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,400
and I don't have a computer that you can
use any more turkey that

724
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,980
published K so this jail sentence 150
points the finger shipping is there

725
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,030
anything despite what you think you're
just kind of my own work either to get

726
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,870
off

727
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:37,430
but I'll that's that are simple

728
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:41,830
340 points as not to point to make some
house without a bit

729
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,940
selector several shapes not the points
because points can change a thing again

730
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,650
slightly dirty

731
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,940
shit on change but ready for the shapes

732
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,140
make a novel about a bit when do you ask
her to call me for fingerprints

733
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,609
and now everyone will have Isaac's
fingerprint on their computer

734
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:01,780
guns i think is on the way as other yeah
when you thought it was funny thing is

735
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,620
awesome oh yeah I figured that kind of a
missile yellow

736
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,460
doesn't know what he is asking that'll
related to relate to that what that was

737
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,220
but the wire

738
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,740
about me well Hillsborough ca forget

739
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,050
the past two hundred users only the
figure

740
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,130
the procs up to four thousand users

741
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,670
but because the mail users and the first
time we take the four thousand years ago

742
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:26,850
proximity card proxy card is a
first-year just happened to do that also

743
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,060
possibly cartridge long and also what
use are you ok

744
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,630
that's what it's for the security
features just tryna nice is also there

745
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,970
you touch it it turns on anybody figure
on

746
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,500
and urine final I'll try anything in
front of it the truck honey ham

747
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,560
I got halfway through the EMA and
outside base-running you touch it

748
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,400
and I that's it that's the process I
don't an HID proximity

749
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,330
thank you budget little yellow line atop
terms of

750
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,810
region is good

751
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,080
and that's one is the the slats

752
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,490
which is all there in the end Ken Segall
these lights just like the fossil same

753
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:14,490
was yes yes they do have a lot of the we

755
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,180
they simply said I we get signal in
whatever that we get singled to be done

756
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:22,500
with

757
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,400
but yes Control Panel just send up the
signal the serial number that you can

758
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,570
after let's do so. the sad he just
doesn't do it this weekend out though

759

761
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,860
doesn't care what does they've really
disappointed in other users

762
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,780
because I'll tell us the best

763
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,100
the proximate seven minutes I have to go
really fast right now

764
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,750
an overall statistical I'll the past

765
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,030
the prophets these leads the flights to
level 10 HIV-related houses several

766
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:56,900
weekend invite

767
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,980
even use the TPS cards while only and
Kearns

768
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,990
I proximity card as the other method of
authentication

769
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,250
the other either find nothing rather
than just cross

770
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,430
if you go into a system where they
really have much stress really have

771
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,399
other things

772
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,060
pages that foregoing the system we want
you to keep as long have to carry cards

773
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,549
all

774
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,150
to do that these less flexible

775
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,150
are you so good he said it's flexible
its ok

776
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,340
this Martin smart card technology smart
card technology no

777
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,420
medium to low of now basically how we're
CBS the talk to the questions I probably

778
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,890
can answer them

779
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:35,009
but Isaac and that's why we're here site

780
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,550
the van with effect basically the smart

781
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,060
the smart has unlimited users the only
limitation

782
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,180
is the access control system for clinton
I'll or the computers make someone with

783
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,859
extremely high limit

784
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,320
I am mine as its up to $500 per door so
-0500 or that i think is

785
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,880
really really hot so that other reason
why is

786
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,340
on here the fingerprint the stored
internally in this unit on here looking

787
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,190
for the store in turn the machine

788
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,570
on here thinking for the storm in the
smart card at the five is a

789
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,110
right but five minutes that he said he's
waving

790
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,420
so in these markets more store the
information on the smart card

791
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,900
I V is the spice to tell you about it
I'm and

792
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,130
that way the database is just a little
here all this has basically in the crypt

793
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,150
password

794
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:25,050
we take the plunge it bring up it says
okay have my past 17 a fingerprint

795
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,890
said the fingerprint over and compares
I'll be smart works

796
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,850
this one simply put your finger print
the page was elected

797
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,430
this problem nelson also be i'ma show

820
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,990
well this is why the mafia likes it
should be shown in image but because the

821
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,900
future is with pizza sauce

822
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,070

okay you wanna get three or four stars
on both knees

826
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,290
this is the image of his actual figure
now you can still sell

827
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:33,380
this is what the juiciest this post or
so if you take this

828
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,080
and to prepare for the FBI they don't
have this they call tracking by

829
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,299
at Walmart loves and various other
people who don't want to using the

830
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,760
latest or the fingerprint

831
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,150
because this is all you have you can
copy this you can we can copy it

832
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:50,400
but can't do anything useful in cuz you
take this you with my finger his finger

833
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,100
it's not the same so what you cooking
all did that night except

834
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,140
think the thing you're just for record
using

835
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,410
i thinkI real so it doesn't matter just
for

836
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:06,810
I'll be calling what do you see INZ

837
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:10,299
a AC took

838
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,370
temple in that story about that it's
something for the future and software

839
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,779
becomes better for them

840
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,830

defense treaty levels over

843
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,319
they're not yes not enough to walk
around to make sure you can easily on a

844
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,300
good

845
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,820
of medium is the average than just sex
on the points you think it actually is

846
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,460
I usually leave a medium another try
anything else the real reason to know

847
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,730
i think is the problem is as always our
nuclear missile world

848
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,560

and it arms turn orange

853
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,700

think that this

854
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,200
is on the figures set on their straight
because it was upside down before

855
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,410
you value most in your strength but
we're all what is going on the street

901
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:05,740
although i know i do not that hard

902
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:12,740
can given temperature sensor nobody
should be easy of the wiring

903
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:17,210
old

904
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,760
I know it this is a fingerprint device
they also have a handprint

905
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,680
it is almost right next to each other
three new wiring of I get a lead on a

906
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,540
classicism

907
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,870
yeah I guess didn't know that this is
the all

908

yes yes yes

909
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,350
separation databases separate because
the fingerprint databases 1 the Astros

910
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:38,910
another

911
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:44,240
work yes

912
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,400

today

914
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,729
reading them if you added to my data
