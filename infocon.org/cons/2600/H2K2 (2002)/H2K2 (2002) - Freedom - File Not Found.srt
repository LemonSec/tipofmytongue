trend treatment it is ultimately a
question so

273
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,600
can we the people govern find a way to
keep our communications private and

274

secure from government intervention mom

persian mister government the world on
%uh so it's a little bit that's pretty

277
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,230
much all I had a lot to

278
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,620
overall and Alan else I'll

279
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,060
stealing little too much on I also talk
a little bit about

280
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,590
here yeah

281
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,899
let him a couple comments about when he
said on

282
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,940
your own little more optimistic than

283
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,020
Heartbreakers I I E and would like to

284
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,690
I would like to hope that by virtue of
people standing up for

285
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,430
their rights that will make a difference
there has been evidence is that

286
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,180
recently I'm afraid the guilt for
example I'm

287
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,030
in the skills circle other we've had
some

288
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,460
affect through organizations such action
to take

289
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,600
for example the government to court
groups like the ACLU but for the most

290
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,220
part

291
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,700
killed his had almost no impact at all
in Europe

292
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,700
they a made statements

293
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,390
they've gotten me a different opinion
out to the public and that is

294
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,490
crucial people say there's at least
controversial

295
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,150
that this issue is I but

296
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,600
I A a I think that there have to be

297
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,920
methods of communicating which

298
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,950
will be up to for example people at this
conference

299
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,690
probably try to develop I wanna say a
couple things that captured here

300
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,190
%uh I developed a system character which
is actually never been built

301
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,590
but a pick up oh so I'll

302
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,959
and I still think there's some good
ideas but I won't tell you

303
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,050
by contrast with most people are doing
with peer to peer

304
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,460
and what in my experience in Human
Rights

305
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,610
absolutely will not work hi there's
currently the view and I talked to some

306
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,100
people it for example from you

307
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,440
that they believe that their project is
a a

308
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,050
anti-censorship device and I can see why
they say that because the dealing with

309
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,790
at least

310
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,690
and anonymity once but the problem

311
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,340
and please take this seriously because
this is to get people killed

312
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,590
other than these firewalls the issue is

313
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,678
not whether that message gets through
anonymously

314
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,330
that message is whether the poor bastard
sitting at his

315
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,639
his computer somewhere in China knows
how to protect his computer well enough

316
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
so that he's not home

317
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,300
China arrested some guy put in jail as a
result of hacking a

318
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,640
farm website 100 data on

319
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,590
there's no reason that's nothing
happened peer to peer

320
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,270
the Chinese government has not waded for
things like warrants

321
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,260
suspicion is sufficient to arrest you in
China

322
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,140
and one thing that I think we've been
seeing a lot of

323
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,240
is that while we're over here on the
so-called free site at the firewall

324
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,610
coming up with these very clever for
example CDC has an extremely clever

325
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,400
I peer to peer program that they were
planning to watch for the soon as I

326
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,570
understand it you don't mention it

327
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,050
at this conference involves a very small

328
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,860
I clients which ones clyde is on the
other hand the firewall

329
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,880
home world will permit in there in their
estimation

330
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,600
yeah a message anonymous communication

331
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,900
one problem of course is how the hell
are you can get this client

332
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,140
China the other problem is once it's in
the China

333
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,910
I hope it's nothing like free net which
ends up putting icon on the desktop

334
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,990
the Chinese government is not going to
be that still that they can find out

335
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,560
who's

336
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,159
running European program they're not
going to wait and try to see if there's

337
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,190
some anonymous

338
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,900
message they can crack to come into your
house see what's on your hard drive

339
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,120
this is not a complete humidor issue

340
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,830
this isn't issue how well you can
protect your home

341
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,110
ass knowing that they're not going use

342
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,510
Civil Lines due process to find out if
you guilty

343
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,760
what I recommending you can take the
project I came up with Cole

344
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,070
Red Rover seriously development your own

345
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,760
is that I think we need to start working
on something that could be called clones

346
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,490
peer to peer need to wait using computer
technology recession

347
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,520
truly is anonymous and we need to
recognize that

348
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,480
what counts as anybody for us does not
count as an enemy at other places there

349
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,800
are

350
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,360
absolutely at least two senses anonymity
gone

351
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,140
healing programming no one sense

352
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,350
he pleaded mathematics no sense which is
to read it on at

353
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,050
you know it's it's not quite the same

354
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,440
but if you're in China ensure

355
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,250
your life depends on whether or not any
means and find out about it that's not

356
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,620
the since then

357
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,800
readings and we're worried about whether
or not bosses email

358
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,540
simply game selling

359
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,570
40 for at least one point where I'd like
to recommend is that if you want to find

360
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,139
a solution

361
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,080
to getting information through firewalls
you have to listen that the same

362
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,668
security problems are going to play peer
to peer they've played

363
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,870
Wed play email my own positions

364
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,090
if you're going to try and get
information thru she tried to use the

365
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,870
least

366
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,919
technical tricks that you now

367
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,130
I have been saying for a long time but
if there was a way

368
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,940
you know you can you can be deputed the
sure if your proposal in meetings in the

369
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,850
me in your book couple years ago but
this thing is that

370
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,450
to the extent that you look like you're
not doing anything sneaky

371
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,909
you can be better off when in a country
with their notion

372
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:49,060
Creek talker P is something that is
enough to get you into jail

373
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,830
you don't wanna play around with things
like stephanopoulos least in my opinion

374
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,210
you know we're gonna debate this until
we finally get some real life testing on

375
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,330
and see people get killed or not

376
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,810
are there was trying to avoid the
triangle boy to my knowledge never

377
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,200
really got news

378
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,060
on I mean as a whole nother thing you go
ahead and created a few program

379
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,879
you got to get people to want to lose it
on

380
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,280
this is completely open issue right now
in fact is that there is no puter

381
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,210
program that's been tested under these
conditions yet I absolutely Martin

382
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,690
US there a three months ish

383
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,400
on yes if I can

384
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,520
if I can say a word about national also
I

385
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,980
question

386
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,800
well the question is why why are you
worried about staying in our

387
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,940
are eyes steganography

388
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,220
for civil at least to my knowledge you
can always spot stay

389
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,419
obviously I mean unless you're unless
you are very

390
00:24:53,419 --> 00:25:00,419
I scheme about what kind of background
picture using

391
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,590
I'll smoke you come up to the mike yeah

392
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,070
you just it we can't really hear you
ended it also gets you want a

393
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:18,070
sorry calling

394
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,549
know that

395
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:26,070
a I

396
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,500
games like antes de que kasabian

397
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,580
spa system implemented

398
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,428
things like that be secure well

399
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:41,900
be look any what we know this is
something very similar thing with Arthur

400
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,860
C Clarke notice which is it looks

401
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,450
it's wonderful tussles magical us but
the thing is

402
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,030
these things are going through servers
in trace you don't know that

403
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,350
and couple years is be a crack to these
things which is then able as people get

404
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,210
around it I think

405
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,610
years far as I know there are already
some some software

406
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,710
that kids awesome basic

407
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,500
stay for also you know that there's
nothing to say

408
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,179
this stuff can be possible fire you know

409
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,740
putting this process are under a
Cephalon can developing

410
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,250
to the point where yeah hogan's say

411
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:24,100
multimode top it's not the problem well

412
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,350
I want that my family on that

413
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,840
I mean the the issue he is

414
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,419
it's not just a matter of whether or not
this is on credible

415
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:38,360
Christian it's whether or not it can be
detected as encryption as well

416
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,049
it's also a matter of whether or not the
actual he hears

417
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,340
that permit you to do the Christian can
themselves

418
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,600
I mean is it was keen on licence is
looking at my

419
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,110
pgp season with great pitches least a
high chance peace

420
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,150
you know any right are look I hope it
happens

421
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,380
I mean dodd I'm not businesses to
hunting such arms

422
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,539
but the thing is there isn't to my
knowledge

423
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,100
yet form of chromatography or form of

424
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,640
I mean answers they gonna stinger
photography per se

425
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,669
and it's just a little cool thing but

426
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,090
there's nothing yet that is in some
sense

427
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,919
so private the other people insane
community don't know what's going on

428
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:28,429
there this notion privacy here that I
feel needs to be incorporated better

429
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:29,770
into this community

430
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:36,530
and that is that anonymity can not mean
that you are in some sense in Highland

431
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,330
I need people who end up putting for
example passwords

432
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,020
program something nobody can crack it
don't realize it the same

433
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,440
other people know how to find his
passwords an hour

434
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,570
and so I mean I guess what I was saying
about this is that

435
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,980
if you really trust that the same people

436
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,400
who are creating the software are not
met

437
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,159
any here like method with the same
levels

438
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,780
intelligence trying to crack very
problem think it's all

439
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,799
I think it's a very dangerous such there
is no crypto is not meant for civil

440
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,059
in a sense in which is is mass use

441
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,740
now not hesitate to travel to do it but

442
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,750
I would really recommend that you

443
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,400
you you're going to make that program
it's going to require you to have

444
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,640
is a fingerprint on your hard drive up
this program

445
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,460
this process that you need to look at
not just whether or not you have

446
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,020
the algorithm you have to really cover
tracks

447
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,668
any cover your lifestyle so that you
don't end up becoming something

448
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:41,880
suspicious

449
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,340
right I mean ultimately that's that's
like the issue especially with a place

450
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,280
like China's

451
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,440
you know it's not so much that I can't
even that

452
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,240
you know they can't leave a message so
so you know they're gonna give you the

453
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,220
benefit of the doubt

454
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,159
you know they can if they see that years
yourself a whole lot of credit stuff for

455
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,149
your you're getting a whole lot of
damage is dead

456
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:04,200
look kinda weird they're gonna start to
get sufficient

457
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,200
focuses orange

458
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,820
heidi's a system making these routers 9
p.m.

459
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,220
financing on at b-day

460
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,260
which I is there any other companies you
know that

461
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,110
assisted censorship

462
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,370
a not to my knowledge this this is
stolen

463
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,600
was was pretty was almost as famous the

464
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,740
the BBC somehow do that

465
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,180
and a pretty good story I was a

466
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,210
where was but part of the

467
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,750
this the whales implement I don't know
they ones obviously that would say

468
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,100
what the okay build

469
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,930
an American working game Chinese news
agency office

470
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,080
I'll check it is hot of town with C

471
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,500
words like taiwan following wrong

472
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,790

Noel no I'll with it

anyway for what it's worth they often

give us space

00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,600
it's a matter of us to raise minus a few
nobody's interested in

550

getting this thing started please try to
contact because we're looking for

funding

552
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:09,760
its first-ever a question you mentioned

553
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,180
that goes decliners systems

554
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,580
state you you mention goes to move
towards less

555
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,590
systems China can access information

556
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,570
without having to have a program said
says India new US ideas

557
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,400
wat ideas you I clarke work measure
church

558
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,520
are and I'm one thing that unfortunately
I cannot claim for this is that it is

559
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,180
as highly secure I in in need
programming says

560
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,529
as as some other peer to peer systems it
wrong for my arm

561
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,270
the idea that I have for this is that
you use

562
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:52,250
on encrypt the taxed in a sort of
childlike

563
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,510
a message katha so for example

564
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,610
hot if you were to take

565
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,760
and I yes if you take an IP address

566
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,470
and let's say the first number was 192

567
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,010
and come up with a sentence they had a

568
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,270
one letter me night later into word

569
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:18,860
you come up with garbage like that which

570
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,660
the user recognize as being an IP
address

571
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,870
said will not get stopped by you're a
worshipful

572
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,009
grammar checker going in and out it's
not a cryptid

573
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,900
it can have it can be a little message
that has variable sizes

574
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,330
my own idea was that I'll

575
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,930
what we would need to do in order to to
make this effect it would be to have

576
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,520
this kind of information

577
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,820
very plainly openly dispensable

578
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,540
through regular email I if it turns out
that he ends up being intercepted

579
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,980
the idea is that this basically looks
like spam and was like garbage in

580
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,740
don't know what it is on there's at
least no fingerprint on the computer

581
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,400
are my idea also has one of the things
that is extremely dangerous also

582
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,800
persistence is in fact everything makes
it attractive to us

583
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,070
think its decentralized it what you're
doing is you're getting information

584
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,260
across a firewall that may be in fact
sizzlers

585
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,040
I mean really be subversive according to
the definitions on

586
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,330
one of the things that is in no danger
there is that when you have a

587
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,840
decentralized system you know

588
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,060
it's at least it's at least a matter of
trust which is far more complicated

589
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,290
whether the information that you get his
spectacular

590
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,500
whether it's really coming from you
think it's kind of fun

591
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,900
so my recommendation was that in fact

592
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,470
the group that would be supplying all of
these

593
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,810
emails with what would be mom

594
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:50,529
actively running IP addresses at least
temporarily until they get blocked

595
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,880
would in fact be centralized it with far

596
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,380
out this information team what would be
a a distributed system

597
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,090
South at City at home system these
things by virtue of the fact that they

598
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,830
live on IP addresses

599
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,880
means that they would actually change
when the person's

600
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,880
logging on so once these things get lot

601
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,770
they will still have a little bit like
trying to block instances in about 15

602
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,759
systems

603
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,020
janet is week so the general

604
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,340
pictures that the essential oils
Information

605
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,240
it shooting out to to assorted future
system

606
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,340
but all the clients free air world

607
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,380
they receive the information

608
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,200
and then there's a different source
which sends email

609
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,480
giving the IP addresses could be seeded
in the free world this thing gets sent

610
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,680
email based on a scheduling system it is
very easy I think to reckon

611
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,940
the people with in China then read the
email

612
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,670
see what would be one or two active
email addresses at the time

613
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,840
only get one too go to one through a
regular

614
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,040
way it's of presumably anonymized

615
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,090
possible course that these processes

616
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,550
but the idea would be that they're going
to a website

617
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,670
which by virtue of the fact that has a
unique IP address which

618
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,360
one its would not be traceable

619
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,680
that is formation this is the system
this is the sessions

620
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,040
presumably they're not going to be
coming back to this such

621
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,380
name whenever you log onto most
insistent

622
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,340
City different IP addresses least West

623
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,910
so the chance to go ahead blocking

624
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,160
something that they block the Fourth
Doctor and leave

625
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,990
at least some other choices that client
is still on for a while

626
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,350
so anything is I had same frankly I have
seen this thing will work

627
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:51,190
but I'm saying this is the kind of idea
that doesn't involve cryptography

628
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,350
any sort I'll dangerous sense

629
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,020
are it involves no change in entropy
levels

630
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,310
because you using regular coatings
regular caddie

631
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,940
are and it doesn't involve dangerously
transporting

632
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,180
these things through the mail because
I'm what you can go ahead you can have a

633
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,600
look like even a small

634
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,480
Chinese even know what sizes in looking
for packets

635
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,950
saw this is only an example of what I
think the bills

636
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,930
it's really it's anyone's guess will
work or not to Cincy I

637
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:30,589
with the Cardinals without with with
three

638
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,290
would you believe the do recent will
relatively recent

639
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,150
this mill were buyers

640
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,109
originated his load

641
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:47,960
would be very interesting way
potentially spreading

642
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,490
acting as for the better for us fairly
randomized

643
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,830
the cage for should and outgoing

644
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,490
going on be installed on the hard drives
see

645
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,620
all assistance his

646
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,950
Nutella today loss speech its

647
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,380
me because basically

648
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,460
you don't need to activities for us

649
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,980
St just be installed

650
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,810
overruns way once surveillance

651
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,210
was story will

652
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,690
those watch knows everyone has a party
of the

653
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,810
critical replication the that point
cubans

654
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,509
cleaning plausible dollars words

655
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,770
because rate no rate notes low

656
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,630
countries tilted balloons

657
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,180
and that seems like the only way its

658
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,399
don't like this can be overture

659
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,500
think about it but is there

660
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,690
obviously with with that but you know
what's not to worry about is

661
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,780
antivirus software no problem

662
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,130
fires is suppose

663
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,820
suppose a internet propaganda Street
your own child

664
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,330
decides that everybody AST everybody but

665

computer as chin runs program me

666

00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:20,890
is simple missing

682
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,390
is something cities

683
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,058
he's East simple

world

685
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,300
if see there's

686
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,360
Chinese Spurs

687
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,930
city

688
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,690
which with me he's

689
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,880
its neither do you agree

690
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,400
ones

691
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,590
what look its Jesus whole

692
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,519
fine

693
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:53,680
miss the know that

694
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,419
sir times

695
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,730
we with usual its

696
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,630
through its patterns could contain

697
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,320
uses covert channels its

698
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,540
still her

699
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,619
I see it is still is still being
potentially

700
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:16,510
jurors look I absolutely do not want to
claim that this thing is

701
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:20,930
a Anne we all owe including me it is
absolutely full growth

702
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,350
I also don't wanna see has the kind of
bomb

703
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,470
of anonymity death some the
on-the-ground proposals have for example

704
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:32,530
I'm presenting at only that it's a it's
a project

705
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:36,470
in progress in some sense I think that's
the direction

706
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:40,780
it should at least the Explorer I don't
see that this whole thing is being

707
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,510
explored everyone's I think very caught
them

708
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,770
in seeing what kind of cool I'll Cody

709
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:50,000
right and I think that the real issue
here is not

710
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,619
to write the coolest cold right now the
real issues to look

711
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:57,380
and this is something that I don't see
people with free network at CC

712
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,660
doing to look at what the needs are in
all these individual countries and how

713
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,910
these things are

714
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,230
are protected these firewalls one thing
I might also add

715
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,010
is not only the one place that has

716
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,550
censorship in China it's not just the
University

717
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:19,119
there in fact four places they're doing
this

718
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,890
there is one that looks only at
University censorship got one also that

719
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,190
there are three other locations child

720
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,560
with these things are not connected

721
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,160
size thousands what of them all out
together

722
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:40,160
offering division him

723
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,810
I to add he nation

724
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,040
as made see you

725
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,460
recently ten-day enforce the

726
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,590
ps3 father be the key and what they do
is

727
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,000
their long I saw 500 stop

728
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,150
that and OST

729
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,150
her this time for this well

730
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:14,230
seat fish so when you

731
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,310
you say a problem

732
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,609
you side

733
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:22,930
cue hitching are so

734
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,198
a so website says 11 problem

735
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,239
for any program point

736
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,569
actual lodging

737
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:38,930
teacher is a a light 1878

738
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,219
tech race so yet

739
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:45,970
effects world you

740
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,420
they're starting in new operating system
which in my opinion is going to be much

741
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,029
more of a challenge right now

742
00:46:51,029 --> 00:46:54,309
because what we're doing is running
right now for example

743
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:58,220
DOS programs G basis computer chip
client for example

744
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,170
I mention Chinese me it's very tough to
get information about this

745
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,210
but they're they're planning to rewrite
the entire

746
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:10,380
government operating systems sure on
natural status is

747
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,970
from what I've heard the rumors that
this is going to be more like Texas

748
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,019
are bond yet

749
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:20,549
mostly because unlike the mama I am

750
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,089
and this is going to be a on DOS on UNIX

751
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:27,960
Windows everything's going to be there
baby in there

752
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,760
probes for are it's unclear what effect
this

753
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,000
have for example projects question this

754
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,549
to my mind that's

755
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:42,359
that's an interesting problem that's the
thing that i i

756
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,598
really hold my breath case that Dec
really

757
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,299
isolate china way which is i think the
goal

758
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:56,299
forge a

759
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,469
my name is Josh Smith sign on the
principles and more Action News Service

760
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:05,660
focus on war's

761
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,769
client is down Washington person

762
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:12,059
recently they certainly open to change
band

763
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:16,450
thinkin midtown Manhattan and of course

764
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:20,229
puzzle Marshall surely

765
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:26,710
and I was over there interesting
question Supersport how much his action

766
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,529
done on films and of course he

767
00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:35,390
hostile don't want was great tracking
system

768
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,979
great package system in the world while
but I asked work you know

769
00:48:39,979 --> 00:48:43,969
is it true the basic way they've got
mentioned

770
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:47,950
limitation laws is a tension been taking
what data

771
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,589
should they don't get Britain should
also all the sole holdout allies

772
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:56,828
and haven't analyzing have a compressed
and then brought back here while I it's

773
00:48:56,829 --> 00:48:57,910
legal to do

774
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,009
number one house who is this

775
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:05,170
for Americans markers motion a sequence

776
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,579
to be shipped abroad to be analyzed then

777
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,150
compressed import back in what kinda
policies that

778
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,170
in terms of long-stay national security

779
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,549
of getting the problems at hand was
capable

780
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:22,509
of military nation are as you know

781
00:49:22,509 --> 00:49:27,460
are this is very worrisome the other
thing is that was also worsened

782
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,650
question mention satellites issues

783
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,979
remember satellites can be changed you
notice what happened

784
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:39,089
to hear the Radian program to just

785
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:42,109
they just shot the jamming signal untold
satellite

786
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:46,200
owners had the police station had the
whole program

787
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,700
secondly there is no two clients sure

788
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,029
way know I know this is country

789
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:57,109
convention I'll it is computing old
technology

790
00:49:57,109 --> 00:50:00,170
number sorry it was a place sure way

791
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,640
would you do away with the short wave to
the way the rate is now happening

792
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,109
go to war going on into okay to chop it
down so while

793
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:12,839
it gets through if you do away with the
short way you just put a stranglehold on

794
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,690
every bite this is a very very dangerous
trend

795
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,589
anybody wall technology does have its
place

796
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:24,489
three-day you want a kid to put together
simple circuit low power

797
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:29,130
page matter get on the air were a couple
hundred thousand people listen to it you

798
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,410
get away from that

799
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:35,319
what simply say oh that's all passion
this is dangerous but I needed to work

800
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:35,930
on

801
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:41,078
what's your opinion on what's going on
stage Israel

802
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,729
what is going on number one policy the
NSA

803
00:50:45,729 --> 00:50:48,910
exporting what data overseas

804
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:51,960
to be compressed in analyzing work back
into this country

805
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,979
any comment on that mister band were
would have no comment on that

806
00:50:55,979 --> 00:51:00,509
whatsoever what do you guys have to say
so this is the US

807
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:06,759
sending send it to other countries

808
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:11,479
a I personally I

809
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:15,410
as that sounded like a dog that

810
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:19,149
kinda that the US is government's
problem it's not a whole lot

811
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:23,079
me as individuals can do about that I
mean the government did

812
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,249
bill you know the basis of this network
in

813
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,719
Ave how they do it you know behind

814
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:34,049
closed lock doors with Andy guards
something we can you know

815
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,239
moan about of a while but that's not
necessarily

816
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:40,469
bring much change on

817
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:44,210
the only way I have that sort of thing
its

818
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:48,479
a ah-hah position on

819
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,839
personally

820
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:52,710
some might have to think to

821
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,740
initially my my gut reaction initially
this problem

822
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:03,740
long I I am afraid I have nothing really
to add to that except that I'll

823
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,530
absolutely firm your police in short
wave

824
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:11,200
got a drink at home and I think that

825
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,349
technology is very dress on

826
00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:19,109
I if I can take 20 seconds to say
something I think we can all

827
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:23,078
try to do at home to try to fuck
official are

828
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,609
if you build into your web pages new
building to the signature

829
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:31,160
email some little censuses like

830
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,420
the NSA be happy to know that this email
contains no information about

831
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,450
is and she hot formaldehyde or other

832
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,730
bombings mom these things are

833
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,760
down to trip up and what we are hoping
could happen if enough people

834
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,450
this is it would simply creates such

835
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,520
a number takes over at the National
Office

836
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,990
that hopefully this is that the same
affected that they didn't Denmark during

837
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,010
world war 2

838
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,430
all dates John judges original stars

839
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,800
when you can no longer discriminating
from that data

840
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,839
I you end up going other Mathis and sell

841
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,400
I don't see as ever sell sure
disease-fighting

842
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,910
yeah there's like I think there's a
anniversary cash

843
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:19,470
about any over 70 needs to be more than
one day

844
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,760
in every day she would love it wedding
last year

845
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,869
heretofore said it was yet

846
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,930
send that your friends percent he did
but

847
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:33,160
as much the these red flag words in any
email you can to anybody

848
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,078
and has got to be a last question no

849
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:41,410
just ecologist surgeons Deloitte's sure
please

850
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:46,680
for sure it wasn't using really easy to
implement

851
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,040
really easy were the end user to use

852
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,700
knowledge listening to the BBC's

853
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,260
species missiles each end oh yes

854
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,950
us date and basically

855
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,430
the question some those eurozone

856
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,170
the more politically politics &

857
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:13,300
non-jury was its holiday

858
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,480
basically was mission

859
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,380
any also full followed of us

860
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,440
workers using is meter issue not

861
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,950
job but literally overpowered the signal

862
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,390
those coupling single

863
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:36,640
politicians it broadcasting satellites

864
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,930
for multiple days follow

865
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,569
this suffers this is for 15 minutes both

866
00:54:43,569 --> 00:54:46,740
us more all six says me

867
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,510
the national channels do you suppose to
measly

868
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:56,809
this are actually affected or is that
something that should be awarded

869
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:00,609
morning on tunes Brussels others

870
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:05,540
still there

871
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,020
a something that's start more civil
disobedience

872
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,120
it's kind of fun funny to see

873
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:18,270
here but not out of it

874
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,259
advances no free exchange

875
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,380
information try China is definitely

876
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,840
10 will wanna see from what I understand

877
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,160
have been to to literally provide
information what's a phone

878
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,750
homes or to the masses me year

879
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,820
definitely by keys hit me

880
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,650
this was missions to gets people
thinking

881
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,070
the same time you know the resulting

882
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:52,670
write-downs me turns away

883
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:57,610
melons his phones

884
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,950
I I N is that a question sorry now yeah

885
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:06,140
are no I think that that if you don't
try to fight these things

886
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,359
it's what you Saints is that I am NOT
going to

887
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,380
basically put my fists because I might
get

888
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,420
BRB harder I

889
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,530
you know it's a personality issues that
I would ever get the other three times

890
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:24,570
I'm this is an important issue and

891
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:29,780
at some point you just have to hope that
you going to give the other side

892
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:34,570
good fight for its money are obviously
Hong Kong doesn't have a chance

893
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:38,690
I mean if it's it's gonna be a matter of
a shield power from the government

894
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:44,670
but Tom I would recommend I i think
going back to make your first question I

895
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:49,210
would recommend that we don't get tied
down on what is that this message I am

896
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,190
think there's such a thing is that this

897
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,410
frankly I think that what we need is
said to keep the interest

898
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,109
Highlands issues in use everything and
anything that works from

899
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:01,170
from shortwave eighty stamp to

900
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:04,220
passing notes to each other and

901
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,670
the ultimate goal yes remembers to get
information thru

902
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,030
it may be that one day technology will
not enable us to do that you have to do

903
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:12,960
it some other way

904
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,010
on but the important things that the
information its

905
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:20,720
will take on arts a

906
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,720
thanks for sticking around for this long
on state

907
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,370
think Rs rush thanks a lot
