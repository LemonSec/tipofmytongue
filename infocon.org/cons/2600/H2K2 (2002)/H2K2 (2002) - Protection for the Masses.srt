1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:13,230
okay every mother

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,880
my name is on hold tight and I'm going
to be talking a little bit

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,779
about some projects that we're working
on I with

4
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,410
a few other people have started a
company announced that Scott any age 6

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,849
any age 6 develops

6
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:32,448
crypto applications to you projects I'll

7
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:35,420
there's nothing on our website for
download now there's nothing people can

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,370
use nothing people can buy from us and
just

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,530
describing a few projects we've done and
I'm actually

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,780
introducing showing you the first
demonstration up one from the type that

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,440
we build

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,460
our which wasn't introduced before home

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,239
loves means

14
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,780
as fast um any age 6

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,519
is based in Amsterdam ever basically set
up to create some other printing

16
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,940
software that everybody seems to be
needing that everybody's talking about

17
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,500
yet we can't find anybody that's making
it and doing it in the right way there's

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,940
lotsa people doing it wrong

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,539
doing it with a publishing the source
home

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,399
our plan is to build are part in
for-profit commercial software just

21
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:22,979
offset our costs and made me the money

22
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,320
I and partly new and BSD licensed are
suffering the cases where

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,640
we don't see any immediate profit models
or where were these

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,679
yeah minor modifications to software
which already has

25
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,170
a new license for instance arm

26
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,350
everything we create

27
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,780
of the source code available for public
review I

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,189
we're not building any cooking stuff for
receipt trust us it's really good

29
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,570
arm these are some of the projects were
working on one

30
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,420
is a security company project up already
talked a little bit about that

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,109
earlier today of PGP GPG mail without me
to the local whose

32
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:06,840
without headache comes up plugins by
locals proxy

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,270
are secure means plugin secure nope

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,620
arm love me to go into each one

35
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,970
a little bit secure phone I've already
talked about quite a bit today

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,159
this a type of phone you can now buy in
your opinion also be able to buy soon

37
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,548
here it's an organizer

38
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,890
with building GSM GPS phone can just
press the phone button and then

39
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,269
no not sure you can see this but it'll
actually bring up the screen that has

40
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,470
phone buttons that are big enough to
actually address on the screen

41
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,970
make the call using this device yet it's
also

42
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,540
an organizer very much like the AIPAC it
means the same operating system default

43
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,340
home so very much organizer and phone
built in one

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,140
and it's actually powerful enough to do
device that does touch even mention

45
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,250
be on the phone with somebody and nobody
can sit in

46
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,590
and it's all running as an application
site your phone home

47
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,640
all we talked about all this is that

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,239
on the less than two hours ago so go
over really quickly

49
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,989
its basically uses all the technology
necessary to deal with the slow the

50
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,590
great and long delays

51
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,720
of the GS in Jan all so it doesn't use
and being between but if you see

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,220
something a protocol is made

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,959
to build to do with that long delay arm

54
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,010
and will put on hold and non-commercial
use version

55
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,019
on the website which anybody can
download they have these phones

56
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,069
or just lie back to the phone card or
anything they can

57
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:39,709
get secure calls without needing any
specialized hardware

58
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:43,519
arm this project is the furthest of a

59
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,090
its much more difficult than than you
would think in terms of the codec

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,500
in terms of any of those things I'll
come back to it later maybe

61
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,860
arm so there's there's definitely
nothing can show their there's there's a

62
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,329
prototype running a very very very early

63
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,689
protect the context stuff running on
Windows

64
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:07,689
that's not a I'm nothing is worrying is
very much the future

65
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,409
pgp I guess I love you know that an AI

66
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:15,290
who is Bob PDP Inc have Network
Associates

67
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,750
a day no longer maintain a

68
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,029
the beach because they're no longer
developing our a

69
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,330
they even have completed versions I
think the db7 for Macintosh

70
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,039
I'm have completed regimes which they're
not selling

71
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,410
I'm and they're not building any new
plugins

72
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,370
and if the past is anything to go by
outlook

73
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,920
udara netscape will all need new plugins
once a new major versions these programs

74
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,480
come out

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,360
our the unavailability of these plug-ins
will mean that

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,110
a huge percentage PDB use a vegetable
stock using BGP

77
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,560
we saw a dramatic increase in BG
usership

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,030
when BB 5k maps a graphical user
interface and plugins

79
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,310
I think bubu Shipley times 10

80
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,240
and I don't see why we shouldn't expect
you an equally dramatic drop

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,690
once people need to stop hold onto
outdated mailers

82
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,950
just to be able to use pgp arm

83
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,400
so we need to find a way to keep using
it in this is why we

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,320
she decided to develop symptomatic quit
too many

85
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,990
is a party that runs on your own PC so
basically you tell your own PC that it

86
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,140
is its own pockets into the server

87
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,979
and then you talking to my where your
real poppins NTP server a

88
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,840
and it sits in the middle and crips
Sandy Creek gmail is written in Perl

89
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,300
and runs on Windows using the active
state

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,680
drove runtime environment which is
something which runs pro

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,400
on-the-spot I'm

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,710
and what it will do is it would have it
would sit there and wait for you to give

93
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,030
it commands such as for instance you
start a subject was critics

94
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,190
column and then the real subject and
then it would replace the subject by

95
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,700
stuff for PGP message or something which
not be

96
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,210
indicative of what's in there which took
the real subject in the first place

97
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,270
message just insert another subject
column

98
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,500
orkut the message to that he and send it
out to the didn't have that key

99
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,590
it would bounce the message back to you
without ever leaving your PC

100
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,910
and what we try to do of it interfaces
with

101
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,090
all versions pgp have a command line
interface

102
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,660
to be basically PDP 256 GPG PGP 7

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,710
so he may know doesn't have a command
line interface she

104
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,100
didn't really feel like talking to a gym
and resources available anyway so

105
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,720
we don't really see why he would be
using it

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,500
this context um me thanks a lot of PG
e's current problems

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,940
one of the problems is that if you at
your own a lovely news she say

108
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,990
and your your friend uses uses a

109
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,430
UNIX box you're lucky to receive
messages in the PGP mind format

110
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,870
to attachments 1 seeing version 1 this
is a BP my message

111
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,460
and the other one was to the actual
message in your plugin can't median

112
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,570
and the around if you're using a you be
mine based system

113
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,500
he getting his message where messages
for PGP the BGP messages in the body of

114
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,360
the text of them

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,700
text message and you can't automatically
decoding

116
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,870
so we don't we try to learn from
incoming mail

117
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,560
whether that particular correspondent
would want

118
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,160
mind or body text back from us also

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,070
if we send messages any other plugins
are even with mother in the third of the

120
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,430
known PDP message

121
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,620
with BCC recipients it's still going to
crypt only one message

122
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,170
and the PGP header contains the PGP key
ID's if all the people that it's fitted

123
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,330
for

124
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,659
so if you get a message if you want to
know if there's any BCC's you just look

125
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,190
at the PGE header

126
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,960
and compare the key ID's with the people
who need to have the CC

127
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,590
any missing ones just ask each other who
they were and see the BCC's

128
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,680
arm then there's the issue of a

129
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,450
including two both RNC keys and
diffie-hellman he's the owner and the

130
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,370
numer PGP keys

131
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,070
I'm which we think is not a good idea to
mix that because if somebody has anal

132
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,940
PDP here

133
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,510
more than likely to also have an old PGE
and they're using that for

134
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,640
maybe on a on HD hand-held around some
other

135
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,849
older PC and they would not want you to
make seemed iffy on keys because they

136
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,930
then they could meet the message to a
train to

137
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,159
very much do the right thing and make
all these versions pgp

138
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,708
correspond with each other and trying to
remove the need for the user to think

139
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,370
about these issues

140
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,620
I'm the single the web interface on
point 18

141
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,190
partners to learn much working on it
would have a web interface support Haiti

142
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,100
where you can also set for each if he
had said

143
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,160
do the default theme for this
correspondent or

144
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,319
always script for this person will never
quit this person or sign

145
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:58,969
always for this personally very much
stronger make it very easy for the user

146
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,660
to never use that the PGP key
interfacing more just install that once

147
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,790
and make it easy for the user to import

148
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,930
piece that came in the mail are and
maybe have a mechanism whereby we detect

149
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,500
that

150
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,959
to correspondent on the other side also
have this thing install

151
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,000
and that it would prompt the user to say
hey why don't you verify

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,560
that the other person wants this only
never sent a text

153
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,759
home we basically have a whole thing
working apart from the web interface

154
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,850
and there should be some prototype
someone called on our site

155
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,139
available for test relatively soon

156
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:44,509
arm then there's the problem in critical
communications

157
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,930
tu problema top mites need to be turned
down

158
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,860
did since mean playing

159
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,519
thank you I'm

160
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,019
group communications our problem I and
there's a lot of people that are trying

161
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,819
to address the problem the readers

162
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:04,790
activist organization setting up cryptic
group communications

163
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,269
I sometimes that is done through

164
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:13,139
I'm a HTTPS sometimes that's done
through

165
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,749
a PGE system where the list server with
decreased the incoming mail

166
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:20,939
and send it back out and that's wrong

167
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:24,509
is that means that there's organizations
resist Nazi

168
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:30,249
a dial activist organizations or
whatever and musicians

169
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:34,370
that would have the the gettin text
messages about the five hundred secret

170
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,829
list servers that their

171
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:40,720
better operating it's not necessary it's
just plain wrong since

172
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,209
I guess these people are being paid
issues across your chest

173
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:48,329
we have all the checks on people they're
really interested

174
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:53,040
so we're trying to do is create a system
with the server doesn't have cheered

175
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,300
in

176
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,999
home to maintain remain most would send
all the participants to keep here

177
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:06,050
I'm basically PPG private key and a
public key

178
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,360
included with the key with the public he
of

179
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,519
of that User that me seem very very
wrong Selena

180
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,839
private key over male sounds very wrong

181
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,279
but it isn't has if the private keys if
the

182
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,129
for any of the participants are
compromised in which case is keeping

183
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,550
hurriedly got

184
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,189
the content is made in this would leak
out anyway

185
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,040
because basically the only thing you're
hiding something you're broadcasting to

186
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,349
all the members of his mailing list
anyway

187
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,949
arm so there's no extra strength
involved in sending the key pair went to

188
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,670
keep their allows us to do its

189
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,209
anybody on the mailing list can send to
the private key

190
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:50,749
and I anybody on the main this law
secret

191
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:53,860
our consent to the public in anybody can
depict what we're seeing today to the

192
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,939
public you with the private key

193
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:59,748
meeting the list server just passes
printed messages are

194
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,459
so what we do we built a little plugin
for me oh man which is a fairly popular

195
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,600
means suffering thing written in Python

196
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,149
for Unix machines and what we've done is
we've created a new property page for

197
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:11,740
the list

198
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,410
this is an incomplete list cordless
would need to know anything about this

199
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,839
you could do this on any

200
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,069
mailing list but the nice thing about
our suffer is

201
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,349
have it allows the the usual list

202
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,870
to select whether they won pgp my my
body text

203
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,019
which against nice if using much less
reasons the plugins

204
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,040
that you get in the right format and

205
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,498
are it allows the the list maintain to
give the public key for the list

206
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:43,970
to the list sir in this list services
anything floating by that was integrated

207
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,759
that would be wrong and it would attach
a message this user was really dominant

208
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,589
scented

209
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,829
and invented but I am pretty anyway
before I sent it out to two hundred more

210
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:53,649
people

211
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,889
so that if one of them if the traffic to
one of the two hundred people are five

212
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,439
people are three people

213
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:03,389
is the traffic to any other usual but
the usual meaning was intercepted

214
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:07,370
it still wouldn't be in the clear so
again we're trying to do the right thing

215
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,899
without making people think too much
power

216
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,439
arm we did a bunch for 2.0

217
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,559
mailman 2.1 assists almost a rerun from
scratch

218
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,480
in some parts understand it so worry
waiting so long

219
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,360
is weakening submitted for inclusion to
do the mailman distribution

220
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,649
which is where it belongs we don't want
to maintain his coat for ever

221
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,660
nor can we and we don't have the

222
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,209
the band with organization needed to
deal with

223
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,100
years and years and years and years you
questions so we would like this included

224
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,300
in the mailman distribution

225
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,379
has anybody here that knows people on
that team talk to me have to rent

226
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,129
I'm any move working on inclusion
mailman another 2.1 version but

227
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,259
that the 21 while the 2.0 version should
be on the website for people to play

228
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,100
with

229
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,430
our what we need to do now is write
documentation anybody

230
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,259
that really liked writing documentation
also just

231
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,629
up on our all this by the way both the
mailman continues patch

232
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:07,990
and the previous thing the chromatic
movie trailer

233
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,990
we have no expectations and making any
money from it

234
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,779
then use the secure stage is not
something we launched today

235
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,660
his demo today to another problem
Windows is notorious for leaving

236
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,569
cleartext

237
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:27,499
all over the district includes from and
it's reno's direction in the temp

238
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,800
directory

239
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,920
at the engines files I'm doing as
applications

240
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,559
awesome special any other Windows
applications also easier to text all

241
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,829
over the place

242
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,600
it's really hard to make Windows to
create a leaner system

243
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,749
where the hardest was not contain any
alleged information

244
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:49,749
I'm several products exist

245
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:53,699
pgp against I am

246
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,869
also is a product suggest I'm so much
that I probably don't work

247
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:02,230
or they were so badly that you can use
them or they're so obviously

248
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,779
security broken that its net there's no
point in using them

249
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,110
their car and usually intelligence which
may be in short supply in

250
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,939
in your particular occasion the who you
give this to

251
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:18,099
arm and the only include portions of the
disc certain party she's certain

252
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,999
directories and files

253
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:26,180
on was never the boot device the 10
spaces slow

254
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,449
and they're all black boxes which means
there's no independent media verifying

255
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:33,139
how good they are you can see what's
inside

256
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,670
and that means is not useful in a
context where large she states are are

257
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,430
glued with

258
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,610
your adversaries

259
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,910
so what we try to do speed something we
call secure notebook

260
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,959
this game it's a TV in its box as you
can see here

261
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,300
its units plus it has actually knows the
international branch

262
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,119
has simple rule this farm all USB
support for small

263
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:02,619
Donald installation key material it
doesn't have slaw

264
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:06,509
because we don't want me to text ending
up in the next stop addition

265
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,589
and has enough RAM a couple
modifications we did I can talk about

266
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,819
this later

267
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:16,420
and our any age 6 secure notebooks offer

268
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,459
inside that we run VMware an insight
that we run

269
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:22,860
Microsoft Windows XP which you could run
anything there

270
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,689
I'm what happens is the outside box the
Linux box

271
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,089
puts politicians of files on its hard
drive through

272
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,369
was called flew back in Karachi process
meaning it becomes a new device which is

273
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:38,550
imputed

274
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,259
and sets of all the keys for that based
on the passphrase you take the key file

275
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,990
which is usually stored on a USB dongle

276
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,709
I'm and then I sets of those discs

277
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:53,189
and gives those discs to VMware for
those of you who really know VMware well

278
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:56,379
the amber has two systems I use is a
virtual disks

279
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,379
which for which he created file the file
system reduce israel needs to be given

280
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,740
to VMware

281
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,209
as real tests for performance reasons
for which he had to hack

282
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:08,540
that's the any age 6 look at SEMA see up
here

283
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,129
we have to have the impact driver to
convince VMware there was really hunger

284
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,410
and not some sort of raising basically
the VMware thing that runs inside his

285
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,640
lunch box

286
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,880
because of this che has no means ever
riding a bike just clear text its whole

287
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,370
concept to the outside world

288
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,880
is really think by this village lot
including its

289
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,170
it's real hardware displays that he
thinks it has which if a

290
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,930
arm VMware relatively large file in 10

291
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,130
which is called gramm 0 which to us
sounded really like

292
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,090
it contained on such an interest in
cleartext so we created was the script

293
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,110
it's less change which is basically a
booty trick

294
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,740
a good time we make the one time he
which he

295
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,030
installer do another one of these
scripted loopback checks with

296
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,250
and Aki have and don't discuss the
Mountain West End

297
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,610
so everything we can to 10 after reboot
a

298
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,490
is basically a pic to do when we can
forget that he wouldn't shut down

299
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,340
because we don't need anymore just
marked a new

300
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,490
which is to a new SS on that every time
startup

301
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,890
I'm and then after a after xx its

302
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,600
after this home she comes down we do the
NEAC tramway

303
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,540
which basically I tries to get from the
operating system

304
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,610
megabytes of RAM and zeros a lot until
it can't get any more than it has makeup

305
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,320
I support you make my tentative

306
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,429
can get new memory anymore it has eroded
all out a minute

307
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,940
releases all that memory and exits so we
tried to do

308
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,290
as good a job as we can and erasing the
memory

309
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,909
I so that his anybody does a oppose
model investigations the computer and

310
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,550
tries to figure out what

311
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,889
what's on the computer a they can't even
get it from the round

312
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,710
there's definitely nothing a heartless
we know that the last thing the units

313
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,540
does

314
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,370
is it have it is a network address
translator and firewall between the

315
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,260
network

316
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,410
and his PC on the inside so there's no
more Windows networking tricks there's

317
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,420
no more

318
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,630
yeah to the easy things are gonna have
caused you wanna be there in orange

319
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,660
don't look it up to the network at all

320
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,380
we try to make it possible to connect to
the network

321
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,300
now we're gonna do way there's a buncha
residual threats which is

322
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,010
what remains after you do this the most
important one will become surreptitious

323
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,020
access to hardware

324
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,020
anybody that can get to your hardware
can love that he's the type

325
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,530
even if they can't which is which they
can they can mess with

326
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,840
deviants install but even if you would
somehow make it impossible

327
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,419
to a modify the install TV and they
could

328
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,240
slash the awesome you know the computer
make the biaz love your keys or

329
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,360
at install a transmitter in it to any
teacher dishes access to hardware

330
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,990
will get you so you must use period and
put it under pillow you see

331
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,580
arm then there's a talk here the next
one

332
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,830
which I with the firewall to to catch
those of course

333
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,939
zero-day exploits against your web
browser we can catch

334
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,610
so a few wanna be very bored already
across from machine minimize your

335
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,820
your your usual this she connected at
all

336
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,889
these things we could have done wrong
could be just plain box or are slowly

337
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,210
biases in in the random generated be
used to generate these

338
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,980
he's for the discs all

339
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,010
residual charge ramen alice is ready
other extreme hardware hacking there

340
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,040
could be some

341
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,409
people offering the chief said that that
does the keyboard interface on your

342
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,800
particular motherboard that we don't
know about that

343
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,930
has a residual charge on seldom

344
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,540
get to be meeting the extreme things
done to the hardware

345
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,730
arm and then this RS and and and other

346
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,510
shit radiation tax if you can interpret
what's on the screen remotely or if you

347
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,320
can interpret the keyboard

348
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,590
arm or even as you can see the light
from us from a real CRT monitor on the

349
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,110
back wall

350
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,660
I it's not improving that that that
light is actually

351
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,860
just the room its immediate by because
then

352
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,240
the the cat the raid from the cattery a

353
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,870
to close on the screen and then goes on
and off

354
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,970
in the sequence of what you're actually
displaying so that's being done to

355
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,480
so these Asian place outside are threat
model are stricken was just your PC get

356
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,770
stolen

357
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,480
a leave it in the train whatever sooo
where an adversary

358
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,620
takes the PC and tries to relax on

359
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,940
its security instead it's not secured
against adversaries that

360
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,290
go through the trouble breaking in your
house however so

361
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,050
just to make people aware of what
limitations changes tomorrow

362
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,710
alright

363
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,970
this is very important we're not going
to do have taken stations

364
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,660
I'm I'm gonna do now we're gonna end
this

365
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:59,660
home presentation hand

366
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:02,879
them and show you improving

367
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:07,900
speech to home

368
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,410
possible left of the screen

369
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,320
dropping off a little bit balls just
means video of groups

370
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,559
along the way the burgeoning text video
man turn off the computer

371
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,280
when you notice that this

372
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:29,280
nice Windows box wasn't as mean as much
to begin with

373
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:58,509
by

374
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,830
this is this is an IBM ThinkPad Israeli
new IBM ThinkPad

375
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,820
it would run on basically any new kind
of computer we prefer notebooks because

376
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,110
you can actually take them

377
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,200
out of harm's way as weird as talks
would be left in a building that you can

378
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,129
secure

379
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:15,450
performance

380
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,850
the basically arm when I can do now is
just part of

381
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,210
make it come back home I'm

382
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,620
basically we set of doing this figuring

383
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:34,620
home loans which much law

384
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,529
you know it's also

385
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:48,260
region back on

386
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:55,260
wasn't wrong

387
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,179
you will be you go through eventually
let me go through this

388
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,200
this boot process with the sears is that
the TV including

389
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Collins

390
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,700
and fines leave land we've set it up to
where

391
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,760
show you we set it up to where you can
either use

392
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,820
the building is in a Johnson on this
number or whatever it recognizes eth1

393
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,389
now I ask you to talk about raising as
you see it doesn't come on please log in

394
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,720
or anything unique see

395
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,900
just comes up with a nice genome style
window that says enter your house place

396
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,520
so the user enters the boss reasons
often secure

397
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,170
secure Loblaw this is keys are unlocked
to try it gets the key file which we

398
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,410
known me bruh

399
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,890
USB storage dogle which broke past since
we had

400
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,940
to have her way around it I'm to the
keyfile

401
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,170
within the crypt in the keyfile I'm

402
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,960
I could go to secure session in which is
basically start the reno-sparks

403
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,780
the first one show you some other things
here in the system settings

404
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,350
we can basically tell which it bought
the peripheral so to speak environment

405
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,320
that we're creating

406
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,700
are connected to than the one we news
boxes inside

407
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,620
some stuff and finished yet isn't
working arm

408
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,410
this is basically where we get our

409
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,790
connection from how it goes it's

410
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,960
10 and this is the fire although we
basically made a few

411
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,190
scripts these are just screams and runs
in start-up and there's a script you can

412
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,630
just

413
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:46,080
aid yourself in a text editor to create
your own home alone rules for them she

414
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,449
so that's the network settings and then

415
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:55,610
he created backup system where you can
create secure backups and make new keys

416
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,280
for the back up soon and there's a CD
writer in the scheme is no POS

417
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,350
you can create secure backups on CD
updated want to back up and there's

418
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,750
there's a special drive

419
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,260
which is 700 makes that you can copy
your data to where it's weird Slough

420
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,230
back in Crittenden each take the whole

421
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,660
you back in printed file and stick it on
CD

422
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,540
that's all done automatically to the
user just asking no to do that

423
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,920
to write to that disk and then go to
this menu to back up and restore

424
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,480
from those those volumes that are
created home

425
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,440
he sees me eating cuing

426
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,500
here's the change the passphrase I

427
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,880
shut down as the keys to remove their
own USB dongle you can create a

428
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,750
mechanism which

429
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,660
if you pull out the use the jungle the
basically the Windows machine virtually

430
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,850
knows she has healed

431
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,630
and he's gone from nothing and
everything pretty much immediately

432
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,580
here's the advanced feature this is the
discs

433
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,399
which are installed on this on this
Virtual Machine basically

434
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,750
this long is HD a-sixes partition on the
real this

435
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,130
and it's presented to this thinking she
has the IEEE primary master gets

436
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,800
you can set the encryption on them

437
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,240
and everything you can says the same if
you create a new one and you see it in a

438
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,770
filing of a petition

439
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,210
then you can actually set the size it
will go out and create a file should it

440
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,040
was random

441
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,080
and give it to you as a disc and these
are the backups

442
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,909
that are made mister with their ID's are
recognizes the latest you can

443
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,600
the trick is you can't use the same he
for too long cuz because then

444
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,730
and after she could very easily tell how
much you've changed between these two

445
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,010
back actually could possibly glean
information from

446
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,230
so we make new keys reach back up to

447
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,210
is being created I'm okay that's that

448
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,590
use a secure session which is usually
just press Enter twice

449
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:56,590
who and Shin all

450
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:06,120
know there's news the whole suite of
both crypto algorithms as as available

451
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,399
in the international hatch

452
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,860
including a actual around

453
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,410
and

454
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,360
days she know there's I'm i think is
your %uh 13 in there my

455
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,730
you can use anything anything in the
international hit a patch including also

456
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,620
blowfish

457
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,980
to fish anything

458
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,860
well this is of course the Windows
startup screen

459
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,410
homes were here just

460
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:38,790
and it started as a windows box and this
with his boss is actually gives you the

461
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,460
power point presentation coming out a
bit I'm

462
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,360
this week is not as reusable we've
refused to play audio

463
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,870
reviews did video and we actually set
out doing this figurine why is nobody

464
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,420
doing it must be impossible to perform
as well so

465
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,600
I this will be an impossible in stable
machine that you can't use me set up

466
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
doing it

467
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,590
in a couple days just to prove to
ourselves that that wasn't the way

468
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,780
and we end up we ended up with me she
was actually so good

469
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,050
did so well for us and switch

470
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,240
mobile does do skiing thing

471
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,060
I'm it worked so well for us that doubt

472
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,700
we within within the frame of a couple
days we ended up forgetting that that

473
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,080
was

474
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,389
this kind of machine he ended up using
it giving it to people that needed the

475
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,640
machine in the office

476
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,820
and in doing the email on hotmail on to
whatever

477
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,100
and everything is working if we hardly
know that the Chinese

478
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,210
that's good enough right arm

479
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,400
it loses I'll

480
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,760
because the change we did what we I we
don't usually eat its possible use

481
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,610
petition

482
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,770
and weak school

483
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,310
homie at the Golden Nugget counter third

484
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,740
the it'll the by developing in the group

485
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,810
coming all 100 failing to protest

486
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,690
I lineage but I wouldn't personally use
it as as my high-tech video editing

487
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,800
machine or my

488
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,860
quake station that short anything short
of that

489
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,430
it is good enough this will do anything
to you

490
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,190
otherwise we need to do home we lose
about

491
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,810
I think I think on most savage
marshlands about five or 10 percent

492
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,570
on the processor and a lot more on the
case have

493
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:32,090
this is we just 1.6 but we've we've had
it installed on one occasion she Asian

494
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,910
it runs fine its I'm we should have gone
to the point where we're operating

495
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,550
systems can be me

496
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,680
slowing us to keep up with the

497
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,190
was the processor speaking increasingly
we have you

498
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,660
I'm which is a good thing because we
need a little headroom between

499
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,820
on Jones's you don't need that much we
have around the room

500
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,250
because not installed in slot on the
Linux box you have to give around in

501
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,270
there and we need

502
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,660
have for for running XP inside the box
we need at least

503
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:07,010
has key it would possibly work in 256
definitely not a 128 again

504
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,960
that is becoming the standard you buy
for notebook these days so we need a

505
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,730
little extra

506
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,260
need a little extra Iran that most
noticeable

507
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,910
and lose on this performance if you do
very discontented things you would

508
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,470
notice

509
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,450
but not as I said we use of its own just
fine without light like official

510
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,460
come down to a Halloween from are
animations work fine just

511
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,520
a webpages flashy all worse

512
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,450
there's there's hardly noticeable that
you're on this machine can can you try

513
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,880
to move on to the mike has

514
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,110
their recording this or

515
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,090
grab the mic surrounding city's access
TV speech

516
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,960
tense home past peaceful first time

517
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,110
that's fine worse I love it depends how
huge it is if you just

518
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,620
skimming the ages about your hard work
due to begin with

519
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,900
then then this might might not be your
thing but as I said

520
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,400
you want to do this on on fairly new
harbour so

521
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,980
no you're fine here

522
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,270
just performances museum where myself

523
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,170
that someone how much the losses just
because you're in VMware

524
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,040
much just we haven't

525
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,399
me test without me having don't like you
bob for anything I

526
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,910
my guess is the VMware hand basic
process

527
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,200
both getting into the loopback take much
more than the actual crypto

528
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,450
that would be my guess i was just
curious my

529
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,620
see day without stuff

530
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,530
is on discontent yeah the thing is

531
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:44,330
the what we try to do here again this is
a seems to all a project to do what

532
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,409
we've tried to do is create a system
which you can get in non-technical

533
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:47,880
people

534
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,940
a scene with this thing and this is
something anybody can do take a pass

535
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,380
phrase

536
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,660
go and then haha chilling those boxes
completely secure than you can get this

537
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,780
she just somebody

538
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,840
that is not knowledgeable about any of
these topics and

539
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,000
have been using it for five years and
then

540
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,070
the hardest would still not contain a
single light fugitives

541
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,120
because about the was us

542
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,320
yes are so this is me

543
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,210
that's mark or much for the most part a

544
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,789
they would usually wait for you to flush
the toilet in situations like that and

545
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:26,549
then coming

546
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:30,340
way while other ball is still filling
where the disconnect the water but

547
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,929
I you can you get here if you take a
hammer and

548
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,070
whatever I'm the

549
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,250
the key device we use does no crypto

550
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,850
a they restoring he's obviously just a
plain off-the-shelf

551
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,650
USB storage device I and we think it's
had its

552
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,230
to be able to separate he's from the
from the machine it doesn't me

553
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,500
offer any at Camp approving or any of
this strong

554
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,039
cryptographic things that some of these
dollars to then again

555
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:06,020
there's no point in believing you know
strong cryptographic things in context

556
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,750
for all you click taxes then

557
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,800
in in the processor and RAM so there's
no point in stories he's in a really

558
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,020
tamper-proof environment if your gonna
move them to a windows box %uh

559
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,020
he back

560
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,859
us to the actual chigney machine machine

561
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,020
you basic basically what what we do is
we have a

562
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,020
I'm a a 700 make

563
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,520
a partition on the Linux box which is

564
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,230
given to the Windows box oversaw so you
just may just pass to it and and and in

565
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,050
the end up on that

566
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,580
on that traditional opposition is
actually is in Salem backfire

567
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,369
so the William let's play this with a
$700 million back file

568
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:52,290
where is where the raging fires in
Cheadle saw her to the witness box

569
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,199
and then when she is done writing all
your files there from windows

570
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,400
to the strike letter or whatever you I
you then exit windows

571
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,510
and see a comment that days 2cd and then
it's clean again

572
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,030
and it's on the CD other venues control

573
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,320
medalist is about scheduled

574
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,150
not I it was pretty she needed to burn
it would have had to have its own kid

575
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,330
the city we have an ID which would be in
the file name of the of the actual 700

576
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,089
are searching to make files on there

577
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:27,430
a say the file name would hold the idea
that if you stop that she taking and

578
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,740
said

579
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,430
I wanna be strong this they would offer
to you again with mounting

580
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,440
from she would need to copy anything it
with mud back. file

581
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,800
and give it to you is another drive
letter margin oversaw

582
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,290
so it would be very simple but it
wouldn't work for for Joe around user

583
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:47,339
it work and getting the fastback yes it
would be completely portable between

584
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,339
machines once you have that key dongle
with you

585
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:52,940
so it is it is possible to your key file

586
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,770
where you have a precise yes sons my
question

587
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,030
Thomson disappear

588
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:09,030
in addition there

589
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,069
done any testing with IBC communications
windows %uh

590
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:18,339
the we're not talking AB sec with women
with between the TV and the windows

591
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:23,719
his because it's all inside the m-net
injustices the interface that VMware has

592
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,859
four for talking

593
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:28,380
we don't think there's much point in
doing I P second that was a logical

594
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,079
extension that we thought about

595
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,089
is to get this box to people and

596
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:37,420
and provide them with with a and OpenBSD
marcher some

597
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,059
other thing which they don't have to
think about for the office and have

598
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,279
these boxes connect

599
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:45,309
to the office box over the network using
some

600
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:48,930
and upset secure channel that would make
a lot of sense yes

601
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,269
the other thing we've of course a lot
about is combining the locals property

602
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,200
from the GV

603
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,130
setting that up on the on the TV in
machine are you keeping with the other

604
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,739
dogle

605
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:02,979
and the Windows box wouldn't have any
concept in Japan it wouldn't have been

606
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:05,839
hearing from people who steal it
wouldn't have anything which is

607
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,190
a send mail to its partners in TV

608
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,650
a a hosts to receive email from them and

609
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,660
a the units will do all the
encryption/decryption

610
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:22,089
sold usually before the removed from
from the actual he would you

611
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:29,089
and will be more transparent news
wouldn't ever need to think about this

612
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:40,580
no potentially work there's we're not
doing anything special that that's not

613
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,700
possible in any other VMware box

614
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,190
caster

615
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,400
the possibility 10 the jeans

616
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,830
sparkler and two the section B

617
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,980
externalize harness thats yes we have
considered that

618
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,240
I'm the thing is we me like things that
don't involve hardware because

619
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,590
from my personal experience hardware
projects two years in

620
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,200
and so for projects like months I'm for
some

621
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,620
weird scientific reason we have we don't
yet understand

622
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,720
I'm awesome people can just

623
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,950
take something that involves hardware
install it on their own machines

624
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,380
and do things with it so there's a much
bigger industrial thing involved in

625
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,090
getting it out to people that need it

626
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,100
I'm doing the crypto

627
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,980
on hardware units however you can buy
two tokens or

628
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,120
I buttons or something and then peeing
the

629
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,020
discreet though on the fly with some
stream that comes out of that

630
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,320
a hardware which is existing technology

631
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm we thought of that but for this
particular model we don't see much that

632
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,710
it adds

633
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,990
I'm in the sense that when somebody

634
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,070
can freeze your machine get the key they
can also freeze whatever stated that

635
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,660
would allow it to get any file

636
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,779
using using your device they if they can

637
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,720
a had take the machine from you were in
a train or wherever violence while it's

638
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,840
hot lines open

639
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,790
then by definition it must have access
to each file on the hard drive

640
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:16,070
for that Windows to run so whether
whether that's greater than resides in

641
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,230
in a token or hardware or whether it
resides in software at that point from a

642
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,990
practical point of view doesn't matter

643
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,150
yes there's definitely applications for
102 that this

644
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:32,500
in our minds was one of them as much as
he likes of the school I but my

645
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,340
citizenship

646
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:40,340
hurts

647
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,870
you mentioned units matches don't see

648
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,310
recall positions are me

649
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,310
I VMware once I geometry

650
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,190
for the drive that its that it's being
presented with so if you tell VMware

651
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,620
that it strives his dad who

652
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,690
one then it then it goes out and does
the i/o control call

653
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,210
for tell me again grr get goin think its
coffers

654
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,690
forgive the geometry this trial and

655
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,150
we basically implemented that one on on
the back devices as well

656
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:14,530
well just invent something nice and make
it look like some like a drive you want

657
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,070
to use it

658
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,740
in el Bano and from there on out VMware
never uses that young tree anymore

659
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,950
honestly happy

660
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,370
if you don't give it the geometry even
though doesn't do anything this image

661
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,990
dies

662
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,070
give the search box is likely never seen
this before call the N word

663
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,800
yes

664
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,720
something

665
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,300
to install he's

666
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,640
used with me

667
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,170
we plan to a through through third
parties

668
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,220
probably a cell the actual hardware

669
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,820
the thing is it's it's a little too
involved to tell people well

670
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:00,270
just I get your soda machine and install
Linux on it and do these patches and

671
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,560
connects working and

672
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,040
a a have get actual working so they can
go in full screen mode which is

673
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,040
training involved in something your
church says I'm so we tried a

674
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,790
I to make it easy for users that would
want this

675
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,910
his instance we just couldn't get the
thing and get it working

676
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,980
a you wouldn't want to sell it was hard
we not

677
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,400
questioning where development company we
don't want to get into this business so

678
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,500
what we mean planned to do is work with
partners that want to sell the solution

679
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,359
working with solution providers and of
course

680
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,310
the thing is as a commercial solution
will be fairly expensive compared to

681
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,080
the other things in the market because
VMware lessons cost money

682
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,549
have so as a commercial solution which
still

683
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,200
I sit in the top of the market but we
feel it has a place

684
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,369
because the only open source solutions
the only thing you can

685
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:57,109
you can she trust so with you

686
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:00,759
targets seasons

687
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,800
it actually get hit

688
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,880
is there a way to get

689
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,970
dues currently we've set it up to where
there's a maintenance more appreciated

690
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,340
on the line go there smoke-free

691
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,440
mister today normal units boot I

692
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,710
basically anything here it being free
for non-commercial use

693
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:24,220
a delivered using community can just get
our program and install it on their own

694
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,010
machine and they already have what's
working and they already have the

695
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,090
International patch

696
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,470
is not get it working so

697
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:36,020
I'm I them for still thinking about
whether there's a commercial market for

698
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,570
for

699
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,050
your food systems and people that want
to use it that way a

700
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,270
and procedural issues are you can choose
to use whatever inside that box

701
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,710
that you want to slow you don't have to
put Windows XP very in here in the wild

702
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,740
and have the added added security here

703
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:58,470
the joy is also possible to ask
questions about these are the things

704
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,930
that are

705
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,310
I into this the PGP local whose party
thing

706
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:09,310
we don't have to focus completely on the
Esplanade yes

707
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:18,080
release date for this here no that's a
good question I word

708
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,340
surely fairly conservative word comes to
actually releasing it as commercial

709
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,000
software

710
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,850
because have we feel produce offer needs

711
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,890
time to write it needs a lot of people
to look at it

712
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,410
and having a beta test context where

713
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:38,049
where everyone people not to use it on
vital data not to take it to Nigeria

714
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,160
and and keep tabs on the government
there

715
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,930
until actually some people with a brain
have looked at it and

716
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:50,390
have said that we have made a stupid
mistake we try our best not to not to

717
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,370
make these mistakes but we definitely
need more time to look at it so

718
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,100
is going to be on the web site for
testing a lot sooner

719
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,320
then it's going to be a commercial
product months and

720
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,330
several months or so so don't expect
anything commercially

721
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:09,990
was in the first half here when we
expect to be on the website that's a

722
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,510
difficult question we expect to have

723
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,460
correction is basically like right now
this is the first time we actually

724
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,660
presenting stuff

725
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,120
I'm something should be on the website
within two weeks

726
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,460
I the mailman modification can go up
pretty much immediately

727
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,770
the first test versions a quick to Matic
should be out within a month or so

728
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:35,460
the this thing arm it really depends
what time we decided to call it version

729
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,250
overnight or something I have there's
still some decisions to be made the

730
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,120
backup system isn't completely

731
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,779
thing the backup system isn't completely
I'll

732
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,620
a stable yet in the sense that we're not
not all the design decisions have been

733
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,540
made in

734
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,770
in the way that we like them so it
really depends what version we brought

735
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:56,630
to the people but

736
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:01,000
usable for people to actually going
testing in live situations

737
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
with non vital data within a month or
two

738
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,450
at WWW dot and eh6

739
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,700
dot com one

740
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:22,700
slalom

741
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,310
so I'm

742
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:35,440
should be basically now aged likes blank
page with a company logo so don't be

743
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,020
surprised if you look at it today but

744
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,230
as of next week you should be something
more legible intelligible there it is

745
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,890
the copy of the slides will be up here
and

746
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,290
soon at least these two pgp thing she
its

747
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,980
well known fact his

748
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,339
stay people physical access to she

749
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:58,500
she's insecure you

750
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,260
given

751
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,110
shares

752
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,570
for for you we hear from there to the
British

753
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,300
for the North kiss idea slide basically
this one

754
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,310
where we talk about near residual
threats and one of them is certain she

755
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,570
shattered her greatest

756
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:21,330
have to put that outsiders as heck not
you have are given any thought certain

757
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:21,870
data

758
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,720
I the only thought I'd even do it is is
were given a lot softer

759
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,600
basically the conclusion is just can
protect against that you can protect

760
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,740
against somebody a monitor behind you
and looking at what's on your screen you

761
