1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,540
welcome

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,620
you the 1 o'clock tecum investor's
visions

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,030
information shares of you should
probably at the keynote

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,890
tried recently interest

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,490
I'm the co author both tecum investors

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,250
visions that the information revolution
be a the book condition:

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,829
which is back were

8
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,250
break she's also here but since then
notes

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,830
I'm gonna make that speech and

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,110
so we have the speech now there's the
book

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,879
which is really the thing that's
actually good

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,040
and then there's also the website septic

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,149
festers dotnet which has a while

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,699
interesting stuff and hopefully will be

15
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,949
bill so

16
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,309
let me just get started much so the

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,470
essentially the title the stock in what
the books about in

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,500
very much for the speech about is the
nature years I

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,200
and as it's been developed over

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,240
elastic and fifty years essentially over
the Bay

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,970
agent computers which its large part
starts

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,970
with alan Turing's 1937 matches it's
just a straight mathematical every of

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,310
people numbers

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,020
with application to the engine problem
and we're gonna

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,569
try to get all the way up to you 2001
here with

26
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:35,810
future ideas once I sing all these are
remarkable documents written by

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,679
Michael people so it's Justin

28
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:43,099
started on turning 1912 1954

29
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:46,280
hits in 1937 so he was

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,810
very young man college student he

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,129
wrote this document that they doubt that
when are we now call the train she

32
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:57,399
and the for the

33
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,590
the points pitcher when we focus on is

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,270
that what he did was he saw

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,190
can computers and that's that is fine
back in that time computers with people

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,560
who

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,280
I'll did calculations bro calculations
franca

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,129
the massacres answer all paper and
pencil and

39
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,890
the figure out how to translate that i
dnt well the

40
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,370
a design for computing machine and
that's now since the changing

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,760
and is essential is a realization was
that

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,549
the behavior other computer that is the
human

43
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,750
kids at any moment is determined by the
symbols which is inter

44
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,950
and the state mine at home and

45
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,760
which ring did is realize that that's it
mein kabhi

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,149
replaced by I know instructions

47
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,280
that says what you do

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
and what is the next note instructions
and any

49
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,298
then you don't need any

50
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,709
intelligence essentially I Disney is

51
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,140
a program and yes the initialization

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,040
but I'll and as an moving right through

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,209
so networks cannot 1945 as we may think

54
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,569
any for bush was one of the dominant
figures and US science

55
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:22,200
alls throughout the year actually go
through 11 worldview

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,290
I'll she one of his greatest
contributions was

57
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,269
he basically was the person who said

58
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,560
the National Science Foundation
post-world war two

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,909
humiliating range but his

60
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,310
speech for the information age in was

61
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,829
the 1945 document has anything which was

62
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,870
published in monthly and in a describe
how

63
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,879
were about to undergo this information
overload

64
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,739
and he envisioned this machine called a
man its

65
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,659
mister for memory in deaths

66
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:02,730
and his idea was that incentive I'll

67
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,419
ranging information hierarchically file
cabinets is a

68
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,560
what you can do you miss you have
computer im computing devices which

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,779
with alll images text and such

70
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,820
and they'd all be rate togetherness me

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,180
associates of hasn't said in the idea
says based on

72
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,740
human human mind operates by association
with 19

73
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,710
grass its nasty instantly to the Nexus
suggested by the Association

74
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,409
thoughts in accordance with some
intricate web trails carried by the

75
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,450
cells in the brain

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,520
disputed action the intricacy entrails
detail

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,870
net pictures is arms fire beyond all
unseen

78
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,410
shit and not surprising that sounds a
lot like

79
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,750
description are the World Wide Web and
his

80
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,380
dalton has made me think directly
inspired the people

81
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,690
power fifty-six years later Davis

82
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,360
or nothin but the web

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,810
now also at the same time though

84
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,240
is when you get essentially the first
real digital computers

85
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,490
a believer but for some was an analog
computer person

86
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,960
and you believe that the future
computing was in the analog computing

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,310
but

88
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,410
really wasn't in this individual and one
of the greatest fears now

89
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,319
is John from women who is perhaps the
the dominant mathematician the first

90
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,410
half a century

91
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,289
and I revolutionized pretty much

92
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,520
every single signed feel all

93
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,770
but he died young from radiation into
the case

94
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,219
he liked watching the nuclear explosions

95
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,419
butthead up

96
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,000
his realization to computers was I

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,479
reading up in the first half report on
the attack and

98
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,229
his recognition was at the again it'd
just as bush model

99
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,210
on was his idea monoculars after human
memory

100
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,080
was too I & Sons is my computers after
the way to the human nervous system or

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,780
are with various organs

102
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,900
separate your input output Orleans
central processor logical control

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,430
and a barge memory and

104
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,669
back is the design pre-match

105
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,258
every single computers still now and

106
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,580
fun an architectural and so in 1945

107
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,849
he made other plans for really what is

108
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:32,580
the computer today there's been very
little change except for in some

109
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,849
advance units but in because before then
they were I

110
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,009
is complicating we're going down by
Holmes parallel processing problems

111
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,189
I separating things but his a
realizations just

112
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,430
make the process in simple make the
command simple

113
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,560
and they have a big am

114
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,659
this is way saying any device which is
to carry a long and complicated

115
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,688
sequences operations specifically

116
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:59,580
calculations dissected you to do
thousands of calculation the second

117
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,409
or millions and billions and my second
civil memory

118
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:08,139
and then he describes meanwhile it
appear that there is part to this memory

119
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,759
have to perform functions which differ
somewhat in the nation consider being a

120
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,840
purpose is never lost hope to treat the
entire memories one for him

121
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,520
and that's when the bigs realizations in
designing computers with that

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,650
the difference between but instruction
and data

123
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,439
is in the is a difference that we know
but a computer doesn't have to terror

124
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,449
and this special processors and
computers don't really care

125
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,439
you know they they will ship to add the
it you can put an address

126
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:41,189
you can put you know and number you can
add it to

127
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:44,849
computer doesn't care at the same time

128
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,159
your computers but you also have the
realization of

129
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,599
what they can do and what their place in
society

130
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,860
and not only to and no some more

131
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,930
prodigy the same era

132
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,069
and a when most famously acid mine

133
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,159
passes at ninety Road

134
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,520
in 1948 a a book about

135
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,590
essentially about with feedback things

136
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,020
and in particular about negative victims

137
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,069
a positive feedback is one in which you
have been input and output

138
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,710
in but those in and than the other and
finds that signal

139
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,930
and you get your feedback squeal like if
I

140
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,180
start this microphone up to the speaker
be a positive thing that

141
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,150
and the negative ads a regulatory as I
thermostats

142
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,228
need it gets too hot the air conditioner
get

143
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,580
turned on be getting cold here goes on
regulates and

144
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,800
what that does is it allows assistance

145
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
team essentially to survive into a
changing environment

146
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,880
and his recognition is that that

147
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,650
is perhaps the the real connection
between

148
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,990
living creatures humans society all
which

149
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,350
survive through regulatory feedback

150
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,420
and the advanced mechanical devices that
were being developed and in particle

151
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,899
computer and word 7s

152
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,320
tons from be greed that to the net is
there

153
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,950
I which means tears means of the same
way the game is done

154
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,329
government and I'll that

155
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,779
it's that navigation is like what

156
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,279
7x in the regulatory feedback is you now
getting through

157
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,180
after your you got your hand on the
tiller

158
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,339
and that

159
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,139
that realization is one of the things
that goes on this is that

160
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,839
responsibilities

161
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,339
see if my thesis is that that physical
function

162
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:49,459
I'll living individual operation
something new

163
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,810
indications are precisely parallel in
their analysis hands to control

164
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,700
entropy some feedback and

165
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,889
that recognition that both

166
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,200
I'll that both humans society

167
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,649
computers are surviving

168
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,389
by threat or a few really inspired a
whole generation

169
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:17,600
people and it's what we have why we have
so many several months after space and

170
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,850
all those things that's

171
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,940
really within the ideas I 1950 on train
comes back

172
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,209
breaks Computing Machinery intelligent
which is more than Kong and this is the

173
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,649
Turing test papers

174
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,529
as a real fun to leave his he has a very
hard since the humor

175
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,600
arm and the the Turing test

176
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,839
are is some you may know

177
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,730
or all of you is essentially

178
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,320
me these are not the same I asking the
question can missions think

179
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,820
he says you know what that's too hard
because yes no was thinking was

180
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,730
intelligence

181
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,209
and those are questions that we can
argue about forever but never really

182
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,740
know the answer is in the sense that

183
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,930
saying that came here saying you
basically say can computers

184
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,060
act human enough that we think that
there

185
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,149
game can can we have a conversation with
a computer

186
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,740
om and Bobby that it's a real person

187
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,370
and a lot of people say well that's not
really definition intelligence and

188
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,949
that's our vision intelligences and it's
basically right but on the other hand

189
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:21,149
are it's something that you can actually
try to achieve

190
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:24,829
are and then his question the list I'm
bill

191
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:28,329
are have been constructed intelligent
machine his idea was this is trying to

192
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,070
print out a mission from scratch

193
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,130
you follow that that people do which is
you can start off as

194
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,839
a a child and then you

195
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,810
are given information be back training

196
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,220
lessons and you become an adult

197
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,899
and turning believe that at the end of
the century sound cassettes now

198
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,680
the use of words in general educated in
were altered so much that long

199
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,990
be able to speak machines thinking
without expecting been contradicted

200
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,760
and its in some sense I

201
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,459
its low one's opinion on whether that's
true

202
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,610
or not is an interesting question

203
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,880
in this was his idea for Thompson said
producing

204
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,660
trying to produce a program to seem like
they don't want why rather trite this

205
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,839
one which simulates the child's

206
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,139
and only today our people

207
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,190
any people been trying to do that for a
long time but only today

208
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,389
factor especially like the than you
amazing getting

209
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,500
process that we have now people been
trying to do that

210
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,130
and when the glasses the big
realizations that

211
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,480
children learn a lot more than we think
on

212
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,550
UK's what we learn in school was really
only that smallest amount

213
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,670
what makes s intelligence most it's just

214
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,029
in drafting I'm with other people skip

215
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,560
1960 makers in the US is now we've got
computers

216
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,190
last 10 years respond to actually going
to Gators got it appears we have the

217
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,160
transistor

218
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,230
we have she's at work and JC other
clutter

219
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,769
was a very soft-spoken but incredibly
influential members he essentially

220
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,769
was a person %ah comp the architect
going

221
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:16,350
which and over the Internet in he had
this

222
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,779
dream what he called the intergalactic
network and

223
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,149
what he did is he funded he said the
first person as we do

224
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,130
are funding for computer science
departments in in fact without funding

225
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,370
founded

226
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,079
are finished all the first United States
figures isoforms will find

227
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,639
through him and he also Barkley

228
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
network researchers there and force them
to work together

229
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,889
and I'll actually learn from each other

230
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,310
and his real belief was that computer
screen

231
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,370
comment humans in the sense that humans
are good

232
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,060
and thinking fast are not in facebook
coming up with Tampa

233
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,820
complicated ideas this is that al Qaeda

234
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,420
he's become marketing questions over
sloppy anything slow

235
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,779
computers their simple but they're fast
in the

236
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,290
you know they do exactly what you're
told and

237
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,430
says she really believe that this is
that the same time are

238
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,680
like art was created to you I fun

239
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,899
for the space race and nasa came a few
months later national game will start

240
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,089
this budget but

241
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:25,199
they were the they were space

242
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,509
government it was government money for
the space

243
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:33,259
he believes that the space frontier was
considerably less interesting important

244
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:36,990
then this recurvature the case the thing
about space is that

245
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,199
there's a lot of it but it doesn't

246
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,680
it can't be changed whereas the
anniversary of last year

247
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,470
on is something that is literally
without and

248
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,829
and his hope was that in not too many
years membranes

249
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,139
machines will be coupled together very
tightly and that the resulting

250
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,269
partnership think is no human brains
ever saw

251
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,740
and process data in weight not
approached by information handling

252
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,699
machines

253
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:08,860
today and against anything that

254
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,870
to a degree has happened in in many ways
as mine

255
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,009
are but the whole goal

256
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:20,149
interface design is doing nothing said

257
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,839
and this person here that angle bar

258
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,230
is probably I'm and I may be overstating
things that he

259
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,199
problems person is most responsible for
are

260
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,699
modern interface modern with use
computers the idea

261
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,250
personal computers and network computers
and

262
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,500
our because he

263
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,790
in 1962 he actually had this idea and
was trying to figure out a way to put

264
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,959
together

265
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,160
yeah i do. augmenting human intellect
the idea that computers the best thing

266
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,209
they can do

267
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,319
is extend your own abilities and

268
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:59,000
essentially make you smarter make this
community allow us to communicate

269
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,149
better and thing

270
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,399
and he had 20 central ideas which would

271
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,569
bootstrapping and pollution was
trappings assembly with the idea

272
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,709
picking up by a good chance the idea
that with computers especially

273
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,149
you can design rituals on your computer
and they use those tools

274
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,120
to you on design better tools Mike

275
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,750
you present the right programming you
run a programming language in you design

276
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,199
the

277
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,639
next better version programming language
in that program

278
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
you can do that with pretty much
anything with computers because

279
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,050
the tools are are just this

280
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,120
and you can manipulate and Micah magic

281
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,589
way and his idea coevolution is actually
one of the things that really

282
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,589
toughened his causing injury interfaces
me he was that

283
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,220
person who center designed the mouse

284
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,050
om and by well you get the picture

285
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,100
were here coming up in

286
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,180
by I'll message you know I could be
increasing capability over Mantua

287
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,480
project complex problem situation

288
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,550
today game comprehension to see
particular needs

289
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,399
and Orion solutions to problems which is

290
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,370
will I have today and miss 10 great
songs for disciplines aimed at

291
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,329
understanding in harnessing nuclear
power want to consider developing

292
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,389
disappoint

293
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,020
into understanding high single power the
long and the power of the human

294
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,440
intellect is really more important to
you

295
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,480
and things realize that this is nineteen
sixties before

296
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,050
this is why I'm their practically no
here's around

297
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,750
and these few people and he was
incredibly difficult for

298
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,150
people like this to convince anybody
even other scientists

299
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,940
there it was worth investing
investigating computers

300
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,990
and services in 1974 he had basically a
system like this set up or I'll

301
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,580
on about seven or eight years before
hand where they've got

302
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,899
you know its it's in person here this
yeah

303
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,390
here power your mouse he's got a

304
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,570
he said accordance she said left and

305
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,590
mom his software the software had

306
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,340
means I'm Windows

307
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,860
there was like network email there

308
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,179
this in text and graphics /a means
essentially modern system

309
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,230
and the what happened was this was at

310
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,169
the Stanford Research Institute and
pretty much in the

311
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,720
I seven is all although the people jump
ship to you

312
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,980
Xerox PARC and were more famous their

313
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,850
in building have what we recognize as a
person get in and those people

314
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,080
then more people jump ship to happens
and its

315
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,539
it pretty direct evolutionary trail

316
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:45,559
the same time as a whole are we have
marshal Cohen who is this

317
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:50,600
I have very crusty Canadian casper

318
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,740
candidates modern technology but has a

319
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,179
because he hates it he pays attention to
it

320
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,559
and he wrote in Bergholz making
typographic man

321
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,120
in his what this book is a saying this
is a a book about history

322
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,520
a media inge the media meeting

323
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,658
%ah my printing press

324
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,750
literature that and the

325
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,289
the 21st transform society it talk

326
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,429
I well society and change 21

327
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:26,450
in which you have the solid books he
created the concept authorship

328
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,679
the the concept of copyright the idea
that he

329
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,850
an idea is associated with a single
person

330
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,730
before in there is can be held in a in a
plot for

331
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,059
in the distributed to the masses that is
like

332
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,260
public common ideas that are shared by
people

333
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,309
the idea of the nation all came from the
printing press

334
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,600
and the pooper Council runs through that

335
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,630
and then talks about how electronic
media

336
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,620
is effecting a equally profound

337
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,260
on transition and what that is is that
the new

338
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,570
electronic interdependence long
electronic global networks

339
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,270
recreate the world in the image above
global village

340
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,090
and using that phrase all over the place
and this was for fighting is the idea

341
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,030
that

342
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:19,590
when we have a global network were all

343
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,649
every idea our ideas are

344
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,780
kinda is in the transmitted everywhere
and at the same time over

345
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,830
actions have instant global consequences

346
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,240
and he's not saying that that's a I a
great thing that the global vision spray

347
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,049
although you know what its this is that
they watch their houses and units

348
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:40,520
this could be a headhunters village
where my it's all tribal

349
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,529
rumors and panics wrong at the same time

350
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:48,820
of as as well as it can be having
neighbors and friends

351
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,450
on all ends world

352
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,320
and then 1964 he followed that up with
Understanding Media it says is a man

353
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,879
which talks to continue serving profound

354
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,539
Galaxy talks about media present and
future and probably

355
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:09,570
with things like that he said in there
was that the medium is the message

356
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,399
which is saying that if you want to
understand I'll

357
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,429
content if you want to understand idea
you have to pay attention to how it's

358
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,659
being

359
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:20,880
tell and like for example

360
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,159
in some sense this speech is the same
thing that's in the book

361
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,370
and it's the same thing as website on
same thing that's in the

362
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,809
same television series which hasn't been
made but

363
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,279
the all those things the you

364
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,200
every bit of a completely different
memory that every like in theory this

365
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,730
issue has been taking what's the table
this be

366
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,690
wasn't it this page be entirely
different in sitting here in this

367
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,620
audience

368
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,990
in your memory and how it affects you
will be completely different

369
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,470
and this understand you but understand
media understand the interface

370
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,570
is why the things that people forget
about computers Angeles Times

371
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,580
that are

372
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,750
what you how you interact with it is
perhaps the most important

373
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,230
and he also liked was that
electromagnetic technology

374
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,110
requires others in Indus love you yes is
that meditation

375
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,330
such as befits an organism that now
wears its brilliant science scholar

376
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,899
mirrors outside is hired by the reasons
that people like me who owns it ceases

377
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,370
because

378
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,919
Heathrow really strange holes

379
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,029
like this and but there's a there's
usually a real idea behind them

380
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:31,730
and this is quite an interesting way of
looking at the world is that

381
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,700
were as much trapped by are controlled
by our

382
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,210
the electronic technology as it assist
us

383
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,080
a its in all technologies to extend

384
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,299
and change our senses and

385
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:50,240
electronic technology electronic media
changes incensed

386
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,740
exactly the way we think and

387
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,200
that means that they're profound
consequences in the way that we build

388
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,669
are machines 1968 like to come back

389
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:05,620
now I'll the art thing is about to be
built

390
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,600
and you have angle large projects now so

391
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,720
like now these people actually see what
the future

392
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,760
mean and the personal computer will be
and leading questions is like

393
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,640
who gets the advantage a all this
intelligence amplification

394
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,720
and the you know it's just ass in
question for society

395
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,750
the impact on the good or bad depending
mainly on the question

396
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,360
will to be online be a privilege or
right

397
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,590
and I have a feeling that there's more
than enough kennels

398
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,029
this weekend that are talking about this
issue

399
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:43,870
was it twenty-five years later going

400
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,100
30 35 more

401
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,230
33 34 3

402
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,330
area and 1968 same time we have

403
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,699
white society is changing its like this
in ways that such emotional films

404
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,710
talking about

405
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,309
and I'll be hartman a head won the

406
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:08,289
great media activists you did stuff all
round the city

407
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,590
means but he really are

408
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,590
drawdown the idea that with the change

409
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,039
about right I'll the change from the
industrial

410
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,830
HD information age like our concerts
working the usual

411
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,960
can change work is competition workers

412
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,380
was late to the party to serve the
Industrial Revolution

413
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,350
we must separate the two must abolish
working all the drudgery

414
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,880
represents and like with physically
sources

415
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,020
you know those unlimited we have to
compete for them but intellectual

416
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,379
resources

417
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,770
only decries reconstruct laws

418
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,590
and week weakens we s we attach them to
you

419
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,580
on kinda always thinking do they have to
be

420
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,418
I scares in competitive resources which
is

421
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,770
assessment and their whole concert at
whether you

422
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,760
you know can copyright control
intellectual property

423
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,480
and then in 1971 I'll road still this
book which

424
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,700
expanded on his idea a free society

425
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,990
I'll which is both a income both ways
it's

426
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,610
the idea that free and that you can
about this taste of

427
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,350
which is not necessarily a a best thing
but it's also the idea that

428
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,630
arm you should have freedom to you

429
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,649
like basically there without I

430
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:37,980
the constructs both the whole world
thinking

431
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,799
and still is but also talked about I'll
is it or is it media manipulation

432
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,850
but they also his inability even though
he was a great heating

433
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,330
you know get the prestigious press
conferences

434
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,370
but actually I just read ideas it
markets the control

435
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,620
the distribution to talk about truth
remove the press

436
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,559
we must talk with the availability the
channels of communication that is

437
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,740
designed to reach the entire population

438
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,539
where these that segment of the
population that might participate in

439
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:05,720
such a dialogue

440
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,140
freedom of the press belongs to those
that on the distribution system

441
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,440
and that's why I like the internet was a
great thing

442
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,580
but you know the

443
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,850
with corporations that control the
overall meteor

444
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,970
trying as hard as possible team ya

445
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,909
moves systems that you know star athlete
into

446
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:31,980
I'll control distribution channels

447
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,669
and speaking 1934 computer-related

448
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:39,919
I Ted Nelson I iconoclast

449
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,690
this will probably be the Wesley essay
describing him

450
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,340
and he can really believe in the idea of
the

451
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,730
the computer for the masses that
everybody should happen here that

452
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,520
computers on should just be something
that like

453
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,679
POV of hacker computer increase

454
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,429
I'm get to understand and use arm

455
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,559
and at the same time he claims

456
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,600
I work hypertext and so

457
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,289
the person is imperative for many reason
that the phone gap between

458
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,629
the public in the computer must be close
as

459
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:20,850
this busty the as the saying goes worst
too important to be left to the generals

460
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,020
on and that sauce right here
guardianship a computer can no longer be

461
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,760
kept to the priesthood

462
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,408
re: even more he was referring to while
academic and

463
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:35,260
on corporate means but the idea that the

464
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,539
you know the hardiest has place

465
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:42,460
in the future computing was one that she
was very correct

466
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,169
and hypermedia point the way to freedom
which is

467
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,580
yet like more the bushes idea for
hypermedia systems was that it would

468
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,850
allow the scientist with the lawyer to

469
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,520
be more effective the 10 hours a week
recognizes as

470
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,769
a mechanism for I'll

471
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,799
keeping democracy in the modern age in

472
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,149
me even if we're lucky allowing
democracy do

473
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:13,289
reach you and more modern performance

474
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:17,059
at the same time on K someone who's I'll
easy

475
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,168
young man is inspired by all these
people and

476
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:23,460
he coined the term personal computer and

477
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,220
not just how much about how their vision
for it and

478
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,779
is his ideas that if it appears to be
truly personal

479
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,380
adult and child abusers must be able to
get to perform these quantities without

480
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,470
resorting to the service is an extra

481
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,309
trouble with the arm

482
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,250
are no's' like another way saying that
is that simple tasks should be simple

483
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,419
and complex tasks should be possible
which is another thing that he rode

484
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:55,450
I and then was picked up later by people
like they're all

485
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,610
are and its in some senses

486
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,690
a though these ideas don't seem like
that complicated but

487
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,230
yet remember that at the time this is
not what people using computers fourth

488
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,399
this is not how he would resign years
and even today

489
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,950
you know this is not this is not exactly
reflect

490
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,700
law might say microsoft stock design
velocity

491
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,789
are and then the range is something
license recognize their computers were

492
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:25,679
the best way things out there somewhere
safe there

493
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,529
the allow you to create whirls on their
modelers

494
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:32,570
mmm the great thing about yours is not
that they

495
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,490
can process numbers quite clear that
they can you can go to be Davies

496
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,899
is that you can explore potentialities

497
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:44,019
the Rangers simulations a computer can
perform is bounded only by the women's

498
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,919
the human imagination although the
personal computer can be guided any

499
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,350
direction we choose

500
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,940
the real sin would be to make it like a
machine

501
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,779
and and slept people do

502
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,580
1988 Mindstorms by see more for

503
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,939
to with marvin minsky was my day
essentially founding members

504
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,789
the MIT AI lower arm and she worked with
minsky

505
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:11,950
on he he was a a child psychologist

506
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,600
essentially and he worked with minsky to
explore

507
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,820
house computers could help children to
learn

508
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,939
and at the same time watch children
learning and to understand

509
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,960
hola to you design better and in more
intelligent computers

510
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,779
understood like me artificial
intelligence the same idea that home

511
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,279
trends discuss

512
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,990
and cap paper was the man who I have
letter logo

513
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,500
and you can see him there with a turtle
our

514
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,539
looking very ninety-seven's

515
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:48,000
home and units against him in the same
ideas is a world of difference between

516
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,130
what computers can do

517
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,309
and what society will choose to do with
them and

518
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:56,350
me this is a great you know his idea for
the

519
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,799
computers in schools it was not rote
learning and are ready to test it was

520
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,500
actually

521
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,640
letting children play and build and

522
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,019
world computers can be carriers

523
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:13,769
powerful ideas the season cultural
change

524
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:16,419
they can help people form new
relationships with knowledge that cut

525
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:18,019
across the traditional lines

526
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:21,220
that separation medicine science and
knowledge itself

527
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,220
from both of these and this idea

528
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,799
that computers can actually break down
barriers between technology

529
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,090
I science arts between like what we

530
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,090
in the the traditional boundaries is the
same recognition

531
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,630
have a hard time now that much influence
the idea that

532
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,090
the Industrial Revolution

533
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,240
allowed us to live in a modern society
but the sacrifices he made

534
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,450
was that we compartmentalize our lives

535
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,200
way our jobs Mike we compartmentalizing

536
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,919
specialized any separated all these
things

537
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,350
into boxes because we can ship boxes
around

538
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,580
with machines but computers in theory

539
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,908
could actually lettuce on still maintain

540
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:10,720
modern structure without having team

541
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,610
separate ourselves from leon 1985
society minuses

542
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,539
pampers partner in crime for are the
sixties and seventies

543
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:24,090
and he was exploring the idea artificial
intelligence only

544
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,000
lotta robotics artificial intelligence
and like his idea life sometimes

545
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,100
complex interaction agencies like you
gonna

546
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,130
and skim over minsky and just say just

547
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,440
this month open society mine which is
remarkable out what magical trick makes

548
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,649
intelligent the truth is that there is
no train

549
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:44,510
that power intelligence stems from our
vast diverse enough for many single

550
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,750
for the principal is the idea is that
you know

551
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,080
that then in the title that it had about
society mind is that our houses comes

552
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,679
from

553
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,260
the interaction I'll thousands of mines
agents

554
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,019
I'll which you know it's you guys
nonsense I in bed he actually is

555
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,309
whatever how that would actually work
but this idea of complexity

556
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:07,519
I beautiful complexity rising outta this
contractions

557
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,789
things was one the basic ideas than
other me know

558
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,570
really was a hammering insider.net and
is one

559
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,399
be popular things like with our sale on
Steam orphans a

560
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,450
new plan designs all these ideas itself
weren't on television's

561
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,169
something that Johnson worked on

562
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,990
is where the big ideas a today

563
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:34,090
1985 can you manifesto that's right we
shall we hit the Asian personal

564
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,220
computing wow there's

565
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,980
stall and there he was working while
happening minsky were down like on the

566
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,669
fifth floor

567
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:43,460
are the AI lab building I he was on the
top floor

568
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,480
I has a hacker there and I N 85

569
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,669
after the essentially a AI lab

570
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,809
lost its culture I essentially

571
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:57,450
to you on the world

572
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,190
unique actually make money computers and
so everybody left and did that

573
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,289
Amin's more complicated story about like
I he

574
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:09,739
d1 T give up his

575
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,120
time ideals likely had worry just play

576
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,199
share %ah with computers

577
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,970
and he's founded this is often which is

578
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:24,590
at the same time tell technological
moral and political movement

579
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,300
are and you the great thing is that he

580
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,240
wasn't just on the list really why's and
in the game as a rule enforced the

581
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,230
principle that

582
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,110
the fundamental active sense among
programmers the sharing programs

583
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,220
marketing range is not to be used
essentially for being programmers to

584
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,419
treat others as friends

585
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:46,960
he say about this document and weighed
down to have made and the law

586
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,770
I'm what it means to you you'll be a
program into

587
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,850
you know and what from well the

588
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,220
the society that he wanted to live in
West but his great work was

589
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,300
doing really was writing the can you
Public License which essentially

590
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,570
copyright by using assistant

591
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,680
which is is designed to control I

592
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,109
access to you knowledge in IDS and

593
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,680
fidelity to use that control to
essentially force it

594
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,040
to be spread in shared

595
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,130
in that's right there that there's
fifties peachtree

596
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,580
I bad 1986 and creationism marvin minsky
disciples

597
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,900
I KR drexler he's the man who
essentially

598
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,980
started the co2 tech nanotechnology are

599
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,070
and we try to do its consequences and

600
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,970
up the ideas and technologies that you
have small

601
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,810
up nano-sized like Microsoft pic

602
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,240
I'm model size machines and

603
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,060
once you have that I you can do pretty
much anything

604
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,420
is the idea summers will be able to make
virtually anything

605
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,140
from common shares without labor pace in
smoking factories with systems is clean

606
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,980
spores

607
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,880
transform technology in the hong at the
ruins hoping in the world

608
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,570
possibilities and the engines creation

609
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,590
I discusses all these possibilities both
the country and dangerous and talks

610
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:13,940
about

611
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,850
like the responsibility in the question
is how if we're

612
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,610
if technology is gonna proceeded anyway
that's going to transform overall

613
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:27,250
are mines in every way both

614
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,380
social and physical how from we cuba

615
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,620
and we cannot do much to slow the growth
technology

616
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,740
we can speed the growth for sale and we
better foresight and we'll have a better

617
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,710
chance to steer the technology race in
safe directions

618
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,010
and he believes that that way he would
leave arkin

619
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,190
10 houses message angle but message that
the way that we can do that is by

620
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,170
better I'll communications and she was
it like this nineteen a-sixes

621
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,100
really believed in the idea hypertext
systems

622
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,430
that would allow us to understand and
said that

623
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,790
this poem in is me up to

624
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,300
the web which ways essentially invented

625
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,380
in 1989 I'll by Tim berners-lee

626
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,460
pop with his paper information
management

627
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,660
a proposal he originally was going in
college I'll

628
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,830
something that the acronym would beat
him wall

629
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,250
in other words 10 medium my he thought
that was

630
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,270
India little to you US interests and
gave it a

631
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,450
less injuries title are and

632
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,010
like is present it talks about you got
your data overload is working at certain

633
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,210
size matters all these

634
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,990
all these different ones me you know is
we communicate when we just go to a

635
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,890
simple

636
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,890
straight for hypertext system and

637
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,220
here with these things in for his the
internet here 1969

638
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,260
for boom boom boom 1973

639
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,970
bigger 97 this is so this is what we're
dealing with now

640
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,310
is in dealing with almost seven hours
altogether

641
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,529
are it's a great thing but

642
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,230
you know what to do with it and so
here's worldwide

643
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,960
proposal which him he drew on a Mac so

644
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,220
any used him used can use software

645
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,710
he used a someone's like he used all the
stuff that came before hand all the

646
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,390
ideas

647
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,009
and in just said okay well you know once
what's hack together

648
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,630
I Hypertech system to give away for free
and make sure that everybody can use it

649
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,820
and its

650
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,550
is not fancy like Ted Nelson Haedo the a
glorious vision for him

651
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,760
beautiful and complex hypertext system
I'll

652
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,310
that was in hong kong by saying today I
think it was a bit like a

653
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,220
sanity his systems like the Queen Mary
in the World Wide Web is like

654
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,110
algae but the thing is that out she's
everywhere

655
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,220
and there's only like one thing area

656
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,870
and like they get when they hit iceberg
facing

657
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,460
so this is like Tim berners-lee said
about information management we should

658
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,530
work to do before

659
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,380
universal need information system in
which generally import about

660
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,080
they already are more important than
fancy graphics techniques in complex

661
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,460
extra facilities

662
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,360
the aim would be to allow a place to be
found for any information in reference

663
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,970
which one felt was important in a way of
finding it afterwards

664
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,250
and its own you know him the new one is
talking about because thats

665
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:25,060
kinda the both the good and the bad the
weather is right there

666
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,600
are and then 98-99 no weaving the web
which had looked back

667
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,319
at what had happened in the last ten
years going from

668
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,940
the idea to what we have now and means

669
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,210
18 the Internet has been set alight as
is that whether inspired by free market

670
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,230
desires

671
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:45,210
or humanistic ideals we also controls
the long perspective

672
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,470
the web's being out of control is very
important and

673
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,980
Mike im

674
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,740
Programming Perl larry while his great
contribution he's the person

675
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,950
I invented from per of is great I the

676
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,180
real great contribution there is that
it's a it was a different way looking

677
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,770
act are I the idea a programming
language

678
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,160
in G she was a %uh have been studied as
a linguist

679
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,490
these items what's design language is
actually like works the same way to

680
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,800
human languages for

681
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,990
that's messy on there's lots of ways to
do anything

682
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,190
there's no him there's no perfect way of
doing anything

683
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,770
there's more than one way to do it are

684
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:31,360
and then this thing bit the other
evidence that human languages

685
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,020
thomas Howell in building and like our
heart a culture

686
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,400
and she deliberately established culture

687
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,220
mike was like you know what I want the
sandwich are on the actually going to

688
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,290
like come up with to go catch phrases
I'm going to make his

689
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,290
a queue and funny a popular thing are

690
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,890
in and with the exact same idea that Tim
berners-lee had

691
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,029
is in german porn idea pro culture is
this that too much control

692
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,820
is just as deadly as to little control
we need control

693
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,010
in we need chaos and

694
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,030
speaking a baton we have haha

695
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,450
nineteen ninety-seven's I kaczynski's
evil in the bizarre which

696
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,040
perhaps most famously was the document
which commits netscape to you via

697
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,230
open the open source for this browser
which is finally actually going to be

698
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,250
really nice are and

699
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,620
like me unqualified open source code
Corp Returns

700
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,020
but in the was getting on bizarre talk
about wasn't yet conceivable

701
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,270
which lies the dominant way of creating
software which was that you had

702
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,840
either clever proprietary close business

703
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,050
or also kinda you hang your hat on trees
like

704
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,070
the guild is not just me are commercial

705
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,380
proprietary things it's also referring
to you

706
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,060
I Mike open source

707
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,799
assistance in which you have what about
your 510

708
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,270
people who do all the work and then to
are open the doors and let people see a

709
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,570
beautiful software

710
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,360
where is the next ways a bizarre it was

711
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,910
three whaling are like you ended up
having

712
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,040
Mike tens hundreds and you know and now
we have like you thousand contributors

713
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,040
to you the to the canopy

714
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
the whole the to the trial are

715
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,320
and that was like the weekend the
amazing thing there

716
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,160
and Sat it may be that one was important
effects open source is excessive

717
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,330
will be teaches that way is the most
economically efficient motor creative

718
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:32,960
work

719
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,220
and this is as the exact same idea that
I have a hot min was

720
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,710
harping about on the streets in New York
up

721
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,310
you know in the sixties and it's a kinda
funny thing that

722
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:48,590
with computers K he kinda the practice
sixties

723
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,020
it senses actually may come to fruition

724
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,320
and here we go to we're gonna end here
this is the future ideas which is it you

725
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,430
know great I don't

726
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,950
and at once Leslie I aware a

727
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,180
a constitutional scholar are in reply to
underscore Leah

728
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,419
in the Supreme Court in essentially a
superstar

729
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,210
law kid and he didn't with Microsoft
trial he

730
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,320
essentially became interested and I'll
the world of computers

731
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,500
and has studying basically got very
depressed about

732
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,540
what's happening on because he's like
low

733
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,460
is week we will make were making choices
that can affect us for generations like

734
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,010
the weather we have today essentially a
democratic society or not

735
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,390
are in were making all the wrong choices

736
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:44,060
and he just says instead the central
idea of his writings which is a model

737
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,070
what his first book

738
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:48,750
food and I lost in cyberspace is also
very good book

739
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,760
palm but this is its great stuff says

740
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,180
free resources have been crucial to
innovation creativity

741
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,750
without them creativity is critical
especially in the digital age

742
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,710
the central question becomes not by the
government for the market should control

743
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,810
resource

744
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,220
whether the source should be controlled
at all

745
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,150
and I guess word this talk hands

746
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,410
and if you have any questions or
comments we'd love to discuss

747
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:22,200
thanks %ah

748
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,230
way I think two minutes

749
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,660
cell you raise your hand tonight

750
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:35,660
or said space

751
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:46,990
in

752
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,730
writers

753
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,369
and interesting quoted personal said

754
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:02,920
the child

755
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,069
said Road little right I think now it's
themselves

756
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:11,049
who dis stem cell world

757
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:15,750
well I mean the idea like you quite yet
know that process like a

758
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,490
have a need for artificial intelligence
players only ones in is gone over the

759
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:19,869
place

760
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:24,160
but yeah like it's kinda like going from
physics chemistry is there anything you

761
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,410
know

762
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,799
physics to biology back in theory all
you have to know to

763
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:30,890
understand the human mind is like me on
the laws of physics

764
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:34,410
on but it's so far removed that

765
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,690
like I you its units is when I think
people trial

766
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,000
in early in the and I would be surprised
if people are awesome it right away

767
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,109
growth physical forms physical brains in

768
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:49,460
see what happens but you know when I
think about computers that you can you

769
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,089
know do you imagine everything you can

770
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:54,109
run through like you fifty thousand
generations an idea

771
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:57,720
except that you're talking about like a
brain with

772
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,180
many transit sounds like that's it ends
up being

773
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,578
amazing power but party ideas like me
and technology for example

774
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,589
is that the the wine between what we
consider computing

775
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:12,589
and what we consider are like say

776
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:16,759
physical like biology or like this and
get were

777
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,970
like when you design a cake

778
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,740
you know when you design software you
can is you have it come out

779
