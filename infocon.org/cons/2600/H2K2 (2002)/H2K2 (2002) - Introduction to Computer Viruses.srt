00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,160
loving the land not because of his

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,720
mostly computer virus lectures is based
on Windows

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,170
and I know the happy community and
especially in the network security

59
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,959
community

60
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,780
we all have to sit there and say help
with those blows its sauce

61
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,799
well is that that's what this is much
here to stay as most prominent

62
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,840
operating system in the world and it's
something we all have to face and his

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,940
which is why there's only britain buyers
is written part walls

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,839
you other reasons why the sign for
buyers as well for that we will get into

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,090
that can of worms I'll with things

66
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,470
start to become a little more prevalent
you know in the operating system rules

67
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,630
more viruses or can be written for them
on

68
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,340
couple years back have a double-digit I
said you know as people start using more

69
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,000
moral ethics operating systems

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,979
viruses will start coming out for them
it's on to meet your goals

71
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:45,219
or viruses other novelists heard why

72
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,580
came well because is becoming a more
prevalent

73
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,440
operating system boers more will be
using it the whole purpose the viruses

74
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,520
be able to replicate itself a higher
system literally useless that they

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,370
cannot replicate one system to another

76
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,530
I which is why you don't see a whole
lotta like mcintosh viruses that much

to the bank and maliciously destroying
other people's lives

104
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,280
people don't take in consideration that
when the virus is a company

105
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,180
like a startup and people are invested
the whole life savings into a company

participate records

129
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,720
does the truckers binary files and data
files docs it sells

130
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,650
PT's sectors he added that he at viruses
are getting even more

131
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,480
province who heard about the the buyer's
atty that's taking

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,240
files on

133
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,610
many people know that there is actually
a virus our

134
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,680
four years ago that did the same thing
yeah

135
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,050
any any for us because it was a
replicating

136
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,329
it was something that actually that and
that the the JK

137
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,350
and it worked fine it was on your system
they had no way about getting off the

138
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,810
system

139
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,080
I spread mostly by the budget in the
file so in other words if you

140
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,280
.jp it does affect that retrovirus that
actually

141
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,540
that valujet takes a min to even see
them anymore are

142
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,020
and then you know as long as you switch
that day he to another person then they

143
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,340
can get it back to bed without

144
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,810
itself so it very much tied request as a
national sponsor

145
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,530
his work for an anti-virus company

and he doesn't have a a cool I'll

150
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,149

155
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,420
they are and you'll be where the UN team
this year the unrest Anderson done

156
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,170
specifically

157
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,110
for the sexual harassment issues because
other viruses would actually threw up

158
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,270
naked pictures /a people's
ex-girlfriends was like really helps

159
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,910
landowners

160
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,240
L here's a bitch that y'all cheated on
me here's our phone number type things

161
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,830
the of

162
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,050
so you started unity putting these
viruses also there's this picture this

163
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,000
lady there like

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
okay I'll you know what's on the does
that work in the office work love

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,510
offended by that so that the site but
what if you walk in here you see

166
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,520
something that's offensive

167
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,579
because a lot of the all time buyers is
like was that the charges

168
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,420
your life you know you reckon so media
and yeah I'll

169
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,479
about you know much people have the
chance of us up

170
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,720
in is that we were very fit is a on the
desperate but

171
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,720
the screen I just dispersal that is ten
million dollars

172
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,010
yeah he's holding on

173
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,130
haha 20 a

174
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,020
want to learn suffocating self-contained
program ok both

175
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,460
that is not percent once denied that
bastard records

176
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,030
food sectors binary files and macros
this summer's

177
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,260
me much purveyed in light of the arm
sees intact there I actually read the

178
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,880
RTC's

179
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,000
done with our sister being a they know
what an RCS

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,430
okay yeah raise your hand if you know in
RFCs I don't know I'm talk blog a

181
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,360
yes it's funny that the one injury that
our CSA the others on what

182
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,410
50,000 for guitar sees other ya right
all along

183
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,490
I have a social life tell so that's my
girls on

184
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,750
and I read about those on the RC's

185
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,000
a

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,670
who sector virus is how they work what
to look for

187
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,099
ways to remove them now this is Cal when
the reasons why I'm have retiring the

188
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,030
spot was bouta

189
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,890
a visitor viruses our car going away
side there's not a lot of boot sector

190
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,280
virus infections out there anymore a lot
of people using like Windows 2000

191
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,430
at XP and other Unix operating systems

192
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,680
are here's a really quick a

193
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,800
true or false question here true or
false

194
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,520
it is impossible to live that NTFS
partition

195
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,650
drive with the boot sector virus I me
think it's true

196
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,689
raise your hand anything is false raise
your hand

197
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,140
alright need volunteers to me why it's
false

198
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,230
was a false and wrong

199
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,690
be a plus

200
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,959
get realistically under normal
circumstances

201
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,200
it is impossible to learn to that an
NTFS drive

202
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,510
with a bit at the virus because if you
put a floppy disk in

203
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,910
has been set for buyers it does not see
a drive it does not say it like that can

204
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,569
affect the trial

205
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,450
sign in or such items as yes would be a
true situation

206
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,620
I actually got a job because the guy
tells me on that and he was a true or

207
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,230
false as a

208
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,310
you can do it because they can't see
anything goes

209
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,060
the iraqi the job said okay need my
brothers

210
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,890
when we ended up doing with it as I dot
a I

211
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,069
an anti build disc

212
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,899
using that 32 using all the know that he

213
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,100
FS files that work hard actually see the
drive

214
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,990
well said mean that it's a that this get
I was able to infect it with the

215
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,680
New York who fires you a harbor Freight
and

216
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,339
but the disc in was able to see the
drive and the people who blew out anti

217
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,769
and it completely blew out in T there
was no recovery

218
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:19,670
and I got the job a

219
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,650
and then I had to fix his computer a

220
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,689
brassieres now let the pics my system as
it is your personal system is it because

221
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,530
he and is it

222
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,589
why did you let me do this to your
personal system his love the USA

223
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,930
if I came here to tell you all the other
day why did you let me do this because

224
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,150
as Adobe in your back at TC a

225
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,870
dear the headlights there was like 10 I
don't see that as a yes if they need it

226
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,410
he said

227
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,630
yeah I just don omar a

228
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,890
as I get the job

229
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,180
I here's why I want you to understand
how a boot sector

230
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,840
a virus worsens I every I mean people
here really don't understand exactly

231
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,950
what the food sector

232
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,410
how it works is cool with a hand is all
about is getting ice Irish death

233
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,969
highly yeah racing redheads handle a bit
higher there yeah you the lobby to head

234
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,580
higher

235
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,500
okay is cool this is all about its case
you guys %uh

236
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,970
the protected by David A three sections
we have the code section

237
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,450
which is basically the the instructions
that actually tell this is done

238
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,670
how the food up you know it member the
old Austin get like

239
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,850
syntax error Meadows Way it yet but that
the other cycles and XR

240
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,840
I the whole messages pop to I was all in
the code there these wealthy

241
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,640
the things the instructors that
partition information has all your draft

242
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,580
restructure their

243
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,780
as you know does a computer and aunt
were the pine

244
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,350
all all your files and where the fine is
like the mini nap if you drive

245
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,630
this world record structures are this
raw files or any idea

246
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,240
yet the market closes by five a

247
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,420
thats what else computer start here

248
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:58,420
yeah it up

249
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,350
yes the 101 either the virus first
copies

250
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,350
the book I'll on the drive to a
different sector on the media assault

251
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,090
primary book pro thats use pressure
cleaning up the system

252
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,380
is actually copied over to it a
difference after they copied its coat

253
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,370
over the cookbook

254
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:21,370
the into the virus code that points to
the new sector get that partition info

255
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,680
on the Indio

256
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,950
and the armholes the they did the
partisan above the desk

257
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,870
some buyers think think this if off
making it possible breach EU gated

258
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,030
the virus is removed incorrectly well my
asset the fires in the whole world is

259
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,959
the monkey

260
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,210
any people actually know %uh TV or play
with that

261
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,030
or are being hit by a day him or have
you coming up

262
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,650
I the DB is so freaking cool his with
much-needed

263
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,900
I'm a very after her psyche walking or
II

264
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,230
does my hair the monkey was so cool this
bright side yeah

265
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,290
a lot over here love it yeah a

266
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,040
ideal head lice that taking it right now
I would look if needed

267
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,310
are is it would do this to me imparted
the it's pulled over in that movie looks

268
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,270
like six or seven

269
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,510
a our second nine as 790 12 whatever

270
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,020
and let loose why we do multiple sectors
and let that actually discovered

271
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,230
up he's a coat over one sector he would
he would

272
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,840
me to go to the next several items were
found an open sector that we can multi

273
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,170
in

274
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,390
that this is the so if you're already
affected like New York he does after

275
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:21,990
seven

276
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,110
and not take it down is also the nine so
basically try to remove one

277
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,150
billion to go back in with the other one
they had 11 remove the other one

278
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,380
it made it really really interesting and
they would not eat it says

279
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,380
just a thought but yeah on a trip to bed
partition information

280
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,290
yeah I had a slight are yeah that's what
made it so call now

281
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,350
yeah so multiple actually loaded the
memory and the only picture partition

282
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,980
information overload the system boot %uh

283
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,550
immediately this is all seeing the
Steelers instantaneous

284
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,240
the marker by five AA thereby Spartans
at the yeah dung-wei had

285
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,250
day get yeah

286
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,730
well

287
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,589
we're going to do. I'm getting to this
report

288
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,929
so there the next light actually tell
you how to do

289
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,280
removal spit if you remove monkey
incorrectly any act together in the code

290
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,459
way and that having is okay great

291
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,640
you don't have to be so there are some
more they can no longer see

292
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,240
your day its

293
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,710
gonna is like was not actually said no
to document was looking at some

294
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,860
so always look for an ours is the
outlook for that

295
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,930
if he is a diskette are like Norton disk
error was awesome

296
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,470
you know is you don't just get all the
time and I just throughout the goddesses

297
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,050
I just go through all the different
sectors

298
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,750
I saw no closed for good observers by
some steamy

299
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,200
duplicate uploaded different sectors is
like looks

300
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,170
I look for strains be changes in every
usage if you start realizing that

301
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,360
was here that are sequences that yeah
memory

302
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,790
yes it was a little higher than normal
yes

303
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,780
some tears are stored on your local
state be here in the OS I don't know

304
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,810
that we don't what does so how do we
really define strange behavior

305
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,149
that you know you know i mean if you're
getting GPS every three seconds as if

306
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,420
I've you may have a problem

307
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,790
a harlem crash-like

308
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,879
by times more than I normally do okay
next

309
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,870
one way is to remove just basic

310
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,610
a he said the viruses is used at this

311
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,020
slash in the ER the you gotta

312
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,940
upbeat despite whatever now this is a
really cool way of doing it

313
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,000
is is that he is with at this slash he's
you that this class in the are

314
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,220
have been so fucking rock I here

315
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,640
I for those of you who doesn't know what
it is like a stock like one person

316
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,260
okay had with that is that in the arse
is

317
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,410
you know what your problem on on the
best beer ever

318
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,660
I don't care what codes they are just
rewriting whatever's there forget about

319
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:03,910
it

320
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,850
words can't put Brandon bought a coat
over it so from a book mostly sectors

321
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,870
but sector viruses it's great because it
just like

322
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,830
says its gonna you know any a popular
think it's that there's a place of it

323
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,870
does matter how the virus is
instantaneously gonna

324
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,890
on another way to do it is just the by
the old code on another sector

325
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,110
and just pocket his head over works the
same way yeah it does get as late as

326
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,020
October 7

327
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,650
well there's real couple well im over
thanks for playing

328
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,180
antivirus offer G let the hon

329
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,800
do you mean when the biggest balls with
antivirus expression

330
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,540
was the biggest follow that our fights

331
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,570
ni no yes

332
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,439
at actually the biggest public antivirus
products is you

333
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,450
you are the public that there are fights
I had and dozens and dozens of security

334
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,010
artisan with the first things I do they
look at that house well he's been

335
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,379
updated what two years ago

336
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,720
rule number seven that but network
security and Ed

337
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,840
outdated dat file an antivirus product
is only marginally better than no

338
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,320
anti-virus product at all

339
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,790
know the first two will not work with
some viruses that that may boob are your

340
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,379
whole system

341
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,060
a monkey was wonderful elton

342
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,440
if you use it just like to say that this
ice in the Arctic monkey bars

343
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,630
I'll as a king over thanks for playing
objectives

344
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,110
wanna bother McAfee actually had come
out with

345
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,920
a special Monkey D remover and let let
me be removed actually do is

346
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,330
in with their and stimulate like
listening to replicate itself

347
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,639
so is everything okay hey we're gonna
head a floppy disk imaging ok rate me on

348
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,960
a trip myself here and we recycle their
look for the cookie is it

349
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,640
star 90 the ink which included keep
running 15 years

350
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,660
phone will kill the virus and Olympic
the partition drive-in

351
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,500
have a nice day and it worked great
worked really great

352
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,130
yet the computers for that you know I
what time they were good

353
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,460
I does it not 10 positive sector viruses
yes tell

354
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,170
polymorphic then clicking in any
combination of these I'll also have

355
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,430
a metamorphic other ones that there's
more Fast Pass

356
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,110
starting to set for buyers cell buyers
is hiding up a memory

357
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,570
and help fight the fires gun buyers
detectors the problem is a

358
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,620
is why it is important to boot a system
with Phoebe just before running it a

359
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,300
detector will be able to use a place
that hide itself in the antivirus

360
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,840
products or visit their and

361
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,360
you actually that with foods out with
the start fires running the antivirus

362
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,940
product watch it how long in many cases

363
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,790
there's nothing here for a reality
viruses like

364
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:55,790
had Sony of Hoosier dad a

365
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,260
know my wife to see this video tape I'm
in so much trouble

366
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,290
polymorphic boot sector virus is the
final viruses are very tricky

367
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,389
the change the code every time they
replicate by changing their inclusion

368
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,990
code

369
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,090
in a very difficult from with a spirited
anti-virus software programs use a

370
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,949
similar to identify the cookie

371
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,580
and then use the key to remove the virus
is very very similar

372
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,000
it makes it very difficult for our an
antivirus products were actually

373
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,640
identified because it's not the same
signature each time you know i changes

374
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,310
in particular

375
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,639
see you can't use the same a digital he
is higher to remove the same virus

376
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,090
so once again it goes into the oil
simulator situations as he began to

377
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,060
replicate itself has a

378
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,470
okay quietly go to the encryption
process and once again against our

379
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,760
I had the great fortune he had using in
Turkey Day 51 destroy you

380
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,860
so very grateful yeah I mean it when you
see the anti virus writers

381
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,330
like at three o'clock in the morning
said they were like hell help put a red

382
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,340
typing away near 10

383
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:57,919
I got it I can go home and sleep that's
not a joke I'm dead serious I mean it

384
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,620
when you hear

385
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,720
sleep got sleep call me it you know that
so that he saw an issue

386
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,200
all one because they saw as we head
there was a a virus right now said

387
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,590
buyers to the company as other says I'll
bet he can't figure this one out

388
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,580
and and everybody stay there all night
and at

389
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,210
35 the morning the next day there's a
new debt pile out there

390
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,810
for thanks for the virus and it was like
everybody has like

391
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,750
Noah Wyle here either as a wetland the
rules on with me

392
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,740
who is okay or like you know on
Wednesday May you're buying the pizza

393
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,200
and beer

394
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,750
that's just house working X including
the sector viruses

395
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,650
in 15 months is 150 a or themselves
making it difficult more difficult to

396
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,140
remove the halls make it impossible to
recover data without the varsity credit

397
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,800
a month he was one of those solo the
following factors

398
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,160
on far better kinda cool I only talk
about one pound lighter here there's

399
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,190
actually two possible

400
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,350
actresses on the any other buyers could
low point to the end of the file

401
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,630
and the beginning at a real bar being a
this put into memory so what happens is

402
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,030
this perception here

403
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,310
is the intro at the virus in the actual

404
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,330
then we'll do with the lucky play itself
over here

405
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,550
to continue on where r la jolla run and
lonely but actually

406
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,760
it it for this is when you look at the
memory

407
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,230
go ahead and take on candy the antivirus
for the west the republic in the real by

408
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,470
Irish file easiest way to detect these
is

409
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,010
larger size files who can tell you right
now with the largest

410
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,360
size a comp file can be hold on let me
down

411
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,510
raise your hand 6.4k so we have to be
able when Meg

412
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,270
pump I'll alright

415
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,960
and their time is money at a little bit
size so you're like man that comp I'll

416
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,580
you know but actually for getting big

420
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,450
you should haha I was like her home
heating up with

421
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,150
said that's not my type I the
something's wrong

422
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:21,370
and a multi-part a virus want that

423
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,020
both the food sector and files apollo
increases the spreading

424
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,040
that has to be the virus by this email
or any other way the

425
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,520
by of this is all really great way the
virus I just found taxes just really

426
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,629
replicating South

427
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,840
the diskette the files whatever so a
genuine file

428
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,620
try to replicate itself a time you
transfer a floppy disk

429
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,310
%uh you will realize that all you gotta
do is put up but just get it right

430
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,510
and just hit a hole in and you infected
right

431
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,500
infected SMS intensely do it directly
any infected s

432
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,990
and then they you'll who remembers Nick
Barnett

433
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,080
yeah all guys have gray hair

434

440
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,120
where's is like again it s profile other
deaths

441
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,630
and

442
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,790
in Georgia

443
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,760
shit a

444
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,160
that was needed at what amazes me is
that that's the thing that was faster

445
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,450
than using Windows networking

446
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,470
I just watching that connects the
fucking computer

447
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,910
didn't a

448
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,960
all come on you know it's true right
yeah

449
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,430
natural viruses on any here we have to
get hit by an improvised vision

450
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,560
day in May here

451
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,960
he never got my vaporize the suspected
it

452
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,180
okay never viruses

453
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,900
there K cool a little bit when they
first came out

454
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,080
you hear a lot don't know is another way

husbands in Scopus

566
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:38,819
yeah he had made the bed another head of
four main propagation methods

567
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,230
are the first obviously if you look at
number one is

568
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,510
its parasitic pippen file

569
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,110
factor so you'll get infected files
obviously one false

570
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,750
rather the email was think that skill

571
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,220
I email was the main are made for the
propagation

572
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,820
along with love browsing for mobile web
servers on the Internet

573
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,840
and of course our there was also a
mobility in

574
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,860
in a explore are 55 earlier

575
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,210
that allow are the infection

576
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,400
aren't for everyone on the user's she
when they viewed

577
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,650
infected our web server on the internet
which

578
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,280
in fact that their machine internal was
that began to be can in fact

579
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,320
internal machines on the Internet silos
those very very

580
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,400
I was bert was a beautiful piece of work
first this kid

581
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,470
alarm while the neat things about

582
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,200
that I thought about member was as
Trojan capability

583
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,550
it the way it propagating through the
network shares compartments it did a

584
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,610
couple of different rows and things that
party itself as

585
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,160
are really don't you know so people
would see all these

586
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,960
really files and not know they were
course buttons

587
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,170
social engineering but the other thing
that was really

588
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,570
sled was that in a copy this all has a
Trojan

589
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,960
reject 20d lol now %uh a lot of our

590
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,260
well word on when were paid

591
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,760
use with a twenty the lol on world bomb

592
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,180
which tax anguished X-files apartment so

593
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,819
it lot for file-sharers to contain

594
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,400
Word documents and it would copy a
Trojan Richard 20 the OL

595
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,900
and make it a hidden file so you
couldn't see it when

596
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,420
the usual double click on the word file
it would look at them

597
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,560
at the local first at the local of worms
launched and launch

598
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,910
call the the Trojan which I 20 lol
infected the host system

599
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:43,210
was relieved local and

600
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,720
home with you this up because this is
like the

601
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,370
well the new bridging the gap in public
viruses

602
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,279
well if you ask some people

603
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,920
a definition that up alarm arm is
something that really

604
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,690
isn't personally 118 that the following
just a custom system the system

605
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,080
and this can bridge the gap is actually

to change

607
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,220
in the virus industry in the world I
hate to say this

608
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,440
that a lot I have two comes out is all
screwed Kasia

609
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,580
you know it's not like the old school
virus writers who said there's a

610
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,009
how much damage that possibly do is
little cold as possible

611
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,290
reusing things i would like nail you

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,070
in like 4k upload official language

613
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,460
and now it's certainly all
twelve-year-olds know that you're going

614
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,240
he was told somebody else's bit loose

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,360
you agree to stop I

619
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,230
the new method to buyers writings are

620
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,580
emerging all the time so the new bonds a
malicious code have the ability to

621
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,840
change themselves to

622
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,120
eBay detection 1981 personal buyers

623
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,549
was a Mac OS fires for those if you
thought that the police say on Macintosh

624
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,690
sorry realistically the actual

625
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,730
first buyers ever written was a mighty
and in

626
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,170
in my teens or is another story no

627
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,790
raise your hand if you know the story
okay basically it was used as a

628
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,600
competition

629
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,810
a domain internationally right clothes
that were decided like

630
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:25,290
take other people's court not the other
Hogan and Xcel

631
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,180
to use a bit much space as possible in
their effort here today it was

632
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,890
competition

633
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,980
and then one person actor cameras name

634
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,020
which is casting the net I he wrote a
piece a close game

635
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,860
it just him only when granted him start
spreading to other systems

636
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,250
%uh their own lives

637
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,460
1986 personal animus boss fires 1988

638
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,880
with the virus is 1997 upcoming moral

639
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,530
viruses 1988 polymorphic viruses 2000

640
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,700
and metamorphic viruses now we'd only
one slide it on the democratic process I

641
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,380
thought you were polymorphic virus was
which is something that actually change

642
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,530
the encryption key

643
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,420
the metamorphic bars actually changes
the code and the coat size it's also the

644
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,020
at the signatures different by adding
like jump won't change in the structure

645
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,750
a little bit

646
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,860
I air things progressing it's pretty bad
keeping count antivirus software vendors

647
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,160
siphoned a identified a thousand new
buyers at last year's bring the total to

653
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,930
these are viruses in the wild what you
don't understand is the antivirus

654
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,279
companies get on average a

655
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,500
400 22 to 800 new never-before-seen

or hoaxes I and verify that way that

694
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,770
that the point I want to make here is
realistically

695
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,900
these themselves become viruses think
about that

696
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,300
here's woods by response to do is
supposed to

697

sure bet with right a impair with you

698
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,650
and replicate well when you have any
israel's

699
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,790
who barely know how to type in use now
says it is

with an edge look at things in the end

705
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,850
up getting up let these things like
realistically these people acquire some

706
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,600
cell South

707
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,490
it's really important to educate our
end-users when you see something like

708
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,040
this

709

I had this little 12-year-old kid at
death caused and it looked

few bars lightning was nothing more than

722
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,600
a script kiddie

723
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,970
a stuff you know the your mom

724
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,360
can write a virus using Visual Basic
Script okay

725
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,590
it doesn't have the elite status anymore
you know

726
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,660
these are not hard things to write
anybody can write

727
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,540
keys you know which Mason that much more
annoying

728
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,710
and how much more that you know so when
you see him BDS

729
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,610
their buyers is coming out the person
you say is like you know there's some

730
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:10,910
like

731
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,970
you know a urals never get his dollar is
likely to die im sowie

732
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,300
K itself as a how that was me

733
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,580
way he's here to see me with that as
well

734
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,120
a

735
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,190
and I he did say that didn't cry like a
little bit with the lady

736
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,220

737
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,750
a the celeb up

a yes even was in the strip

739
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,560
hostile good now

740
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,370
everything we talk about is considered
ha so close so what's the deal

741
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:53,310
realistically when I talk about hard to
put up talking about things that

742
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,940
is like brand new undiscovered stuff you
know new and undiscovered

743
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,330
in the wild things that there are no
doubt ha sitting for

744
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,720
by love you viruses for example i love u
Myers hit

745
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,110
it replicated spread across the nation
like

746
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:12,270
owners is that things he was so fast %uh
so I had to get credit on that

747
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,000
you know mostly because you know it was
using stupid email servers

748
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,270
but now a good example well as

749
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:23,000
when he hit the wild the vapors
antivirus popping out there

750
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,940
who had at this for had a thanks to
hours after hit the US

751
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,570
you know is I fr you have secure and

752
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,600
two hours after he hit the US they
identified it

753
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,690
they had thanks for and they trace it
back to country watchin was pretty fast

754
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,240
but we're also talking about things like
Java

755
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,080
activists and other stuff like that you
know these can all be determined as

756
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,040
hostile codes

757
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,590
summer the mores sites you guys go to
you don't realize actually drop a Trojan

758
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,410

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,880
I you can now that could help out a lot
I securing a when this is done

818
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,330
has never ended that any level of I you
could hear me

819
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,660
may have topped with Microsoft Windows
in realistically

820
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,839
I do actually love the operating system
and because

821
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,510
you know I'm a gamer at heart love
playing computer games realistically the

822
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,300
cascades on the system's

823
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,390
right there's a lot you can do on when
this is done

824
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,759
you know i i thought i a

825
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,120
hackers all other nations on says an
oily use a living system I'll use the

826
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,950
I'll the Nexus whatever and I know
people who is that there's a

827
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,770
do that Italy router box with the
windows no hot when the sacrifices and

828
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,540
just as easy

829
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,470
was the deal you know it is all about
skill are

830
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,080
whether we should have to defend
yourself as well for the call see much

831
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,670
technology

832
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,020
peso has a multi-party work what it does
is actually a

833
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,110
anything that you exit execute on your
system gets put into it DMZ sandbox

834
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,220
and what it does is it in an isolated as
he gets here

835
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,500
and when excuse according to seize any
hostile activity it stopped in his

836
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,180
tracks

837
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,649
as is you know what this looks like a
financial do something that Hartnell bad

838
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:47,140
loving it do or not II stop

839
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:51,040
it's like to have it this is really
messed up what about that

840
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,279
qualities Pharma there are none

841
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,560
is not looking for signatures is looking
for hostile activity

842
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,799
yeah

843
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,750
speed yeah a pot

844
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:14,750
secure secure secure is an antivirus
nothing mmm

845
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,690
its I'll get it bro sandboxes

846
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:24,250
it's an awesome new hope approach
relatively new

847
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,260
all yet remember that a any bars

848
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,770
bought or react I know and as

849
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,540
our hearts hearts become you know more
complex

850
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,840
it takes farce in bars pubs longer to

851
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,730
right signatures for and that time
period with them spreading

852
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,920
near speed of light know that Times
quoted so what they're doing is

853
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,950
some of these are going with sandbox
Sala Rossa

854
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,370
integrating a personal firewall software
into their

855
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,430
any bars offer and is based on behavior

856
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:59,430
blocking block certain hope to behaviors
are not going to allow them

857
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,710
functional probe at if I am active

858
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:07,440
you know pro bout that network problem
restrict that behavior exam also wanna

859
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,010
be heard

860
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:12,060
it is me

861
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,310
and ask to be ended December fav
technologies need to be

862
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:19,420
mom by Antonov I in team but once you're
tuned

863
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,780
there are there's lots of the rocks all
now here's an example

864
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,980
are I really be at the useful engines
are concealed

865
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,630
no I don't take a class for the company
is by the Allied is a curious

866
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:34,320
as well because I always recommend it
doesn't use data files

867
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,660
and it doesn't replace antivirus product
it works in conjunction

868
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,069
will your antivirus products what it
does is in helping kisses from hospital

869
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,660
a perfect example that they actually use
on the website pages as

870
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,990
companies that actually we're using the
I'll engine serving shield when the I

871
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,900
Love You virus

872
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,490
here those companies but I believe that
it's thought that i love u liars

873
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:58,290
in its tracks the party back to the
system does he take it is hard to hold

874
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:01,450
is mostly used for things like after
that and jobs

875
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:04,690
so for you back there with you could
actually have is you could actually be

876
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,860
ready just in the background and
actually have

877
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,560
I after that and are running on your
system and when it he hit a web page to

878
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,320
be detected

879
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,730
hostile activity would have to stop it
last year interfering with you don't

880
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,730
like the new service

881
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,450
all the questions that okay or counting
on time here

882
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,859
are the website prevention is out there
that we have you got

883
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:28,370
engine dot com by and a and are a great
person to talk to cheese

884
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:31,690
at the Rec I work with all the time for
the company I'm presently working with

885
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:33,310
words all over by a car

886
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,520

special thanks to our home party here if

889
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,710
it had been a lot of input and help out

890
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,770
I'll and nothing were oil companies

891
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:59,770
%ah

892
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,900
on have about four minutes for questions

893
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:10,900
are you know it's very very

894
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,450
unique that is a much technology they
have brought servers

895
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:19,130
firewalls I'll workstations are so far
its

896
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,319
its it's very unique done on how it
works are

897
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,859
at all the difficulties they they are
doing it the only 1i fathers

898
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:32,859
in the most reliable engine and it has
it all so

899
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,119
there's a couple I'll a multi OS

900
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,640
fires is that the %uh that effect but
what is it and when it's Lexus started

901
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,848
the bubble a bit more

902
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:47,200
a stronger following it because others
couple things in things

903
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,970
well %ah the viruses are people lives
are in developing our

904
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,180
is they're looking for liabilities in
the next

905
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,050
for that people don't only pat the virus
looks for that it would ask this place

906
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:58,359
of

907
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:03,080
work

908
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:10,080
only gets going

909
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,710
no

910
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,720
