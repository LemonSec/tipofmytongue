1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,830
lease and Joan please show off your
phones in the pages

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,009
today we're talking about caller ID the
three types a caller ID his type one

3
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,400
caller ID which is a standard caller ID
when someone calls airline directly

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,800
and on between the first and the second
ring data gets sent

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,380
then this type 2 caller ID which is call
waiting I D

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,230
call waiting ID is when you're on the
phone and you have

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,900
call waiting service from the phone
company ends

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,580
someone calls you and the ID shows up on
the screen you can switch over

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,580
or you could just ignore the call and
his type 3 caller ID

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,809
type3 caller ID is not used as much
anymore

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,890
it was popular for a little while it's
called

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,620
ADSI analog display services and

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,430
it was used by a places like Citibank
UPS

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,650
and it's basically the used it for order
processing and stuff like that because

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,290
type3 caller ID

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,820
is a two-way communication using the
bell 2002

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,370
modem protocol the type 1 and type

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,790
to are also they also utilize the bell
2002

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,450
a modem but they don't they're not to a
communications

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,480
and if the communication doesn't go
through correctly

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,030
there is no way for to correct itself it
does have

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,190
minor error detection so you can see if

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,480
it was validator validated that occurred
or not

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,260
um with type 1

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,890
there's no acknowledgement to the phone
company whatsoever that the data was

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,620
received

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,860
with type 2 caller ID there is a

28
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,229
yet DTMF touchtone I which is

29
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,890
touchtone the letter D which is not a
standard tone that shows up on your

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,460
caller

31
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,590
on your phone keypad but it is one of
the

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,140
phone companies the standard touchstones

33
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,580
type3 technologies with the

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,280
touchtone letter A instead dove

35
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,520
touch on D I'll basically take three is
also referred to as call waiting to

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,220
locks

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,430
and I guess said with type 1 and type 2

38
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,049
there are no air corrections if if it
doesn't if there's an error it just

39
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,060
displays error

40
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,409
are you get garbage on your screen but
most usually

41
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:24,340
you'll get there if they comply to the
protocol when they built the caller ID

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,060
box

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,239
bill 2002 protocol is a 1200 Boyd

44
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,189
a signal at 1200 bits per second

45
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,629
it is not the same as bell 212 which is
what

46
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,950
usually your modems if you buy a modem
it's 1200 board in the store

47
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,239
or modem that is capable of going down
to 1200 baud

48
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,650
it's not the same protocol it won't work
for caller ID at all

49
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,010
I the protocol is

50
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,040
a binary one is equal to 1200 hurts in
binary 0

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,400
is equal to 2200 hurts and each be

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,200
time the time it takes for each bit is
point 833 milliseconds long

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,930
and its analog phase coherent FSK

54
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,959
and basically you the some what that
means is the phase coherent part in

55
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:14,489
everything

56
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,499
basically when one %uh the sine curves

57
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:21,040
ends the next one continues from that
point

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,578
now one sine curve 1200 hurts happens to
be exactly one cycle of 1200

59
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:33,459
a hertz is one cycle for pointy teeth
email seconds but 2200 hurts

60
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,230
is more than one cycle but less than two
cycles

61
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,989
it's actually 1.8 33 milliseconds long

62
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,239
I not I'm not no seconds 1.83 three
cycles

63
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,719
long is point a treaty mill seconds of
2200 hurts

64
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,989
I pretty much when I went about trying
to write a program to use the sound card

65
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,650
to generate caller ID this was that was
pretty much difficulty

66
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,760
trying to get it to accurately

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,168
a finish one cycle overseas

68
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:12,279
a sine curve and continue with the next
one where it left off

69
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:17,759
I and build the entire wave I couldn't
go about it by just generating

70
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,039
one specific audio frequency in
switching to the next one

71
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,219
because the the the sound card can't
handle

72
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,789
it first for just 23 30 seconds it will
work

73
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,740
a $1 mil Sechin I mean that no one will
say one sec in is about

74
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,490
as accurate as you can get I in less you

75
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,240
build the entire way first you have to
build though entire way file

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,659
and then you can play the entire way
following that would be accurate

77
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:50,690
I have not built the sound card version
yet I built one that uses a bell 2002

78
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,599
motorhome

79
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,729
there I i'm is used I boy from

80
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:59,620
a store that they basically sell it for
tele men she be still sell it today they

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,550
they manufacture in New there the to use
for tell men tree which is like over the

82
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,340
radio

83
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,580
they'll send the data to everybody I to
communicate between computers

84
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,599
I the the other software I was trying to
write with the sound card that's not

85
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:16,430
done yet

86
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,770
however I am to other people have done
it

87
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,270
the first switch you guys may have heard
of was Saab

88
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,008
saw for arch box a software Irish boxer
first one was released it did not work

89
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,159
properly

90
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,659
and I sent them a bunch emails telling
them what was wrong

91
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,229
and after they receive emails

92
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:42,628
they send me some emails back and
eventually when they found out we were

93
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,800
doing this panel that age to k2

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,150
its side effects Asia so now so for
Orange Box the newest version actually

95
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,389
does work

96
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,340
um it however instead being freeware
like the previous versions this one

97
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,740
is now shareware and you have to
depending on who you are is that

98
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,819
typeof licensing that you have to pay
for

99
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,560
sand this feature that you're missing is
that you can save the way file now now

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,539
you can just play it directly

101
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,360
and the saving feature is only for the
people that pay for the registered

102
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,550
version

103
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,430
then here is for those EU who would
rather not have to pay for it

104
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,400
if there is any alternative there is a
web page now on the Internet

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,680
and is a guy name spoon him and he wrote
his own version using Perl

106
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,069
and its open source and you can download
it if you want to run it on your own

107
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,219
computers

108
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,719
or if you want you can just to run eight
of his web CGI interface

109
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,310
you fill in the form you hit enter and
then it just generates the way file

110
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,639
any is a link there for you to download
it all for free

111
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,650
in the air I'll give you the link it
later Nathan good cook

112
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,960
great all for free

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,319
so in the meantime I the

114
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,419
I realize how difficult it after
attempting to write the sound guy

115
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,349
version I really realize how difficult
it was to attempt that

116
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:15,960
and for spoon to have done it so quickly
in such little time

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,990
is quite an accomplishment is pretty
cool I

118
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,129
took a more like four hours yeah

119
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,840
for how hurts him and

120
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,400
an aside by it's been many revisions hey
look many complaints

121
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,990
but at least it works I am

122
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,999
other than that the the

123
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:43,310
type to caller ID a type one caller ID
the way the

124
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,560
the way the protocol is is did

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,819
it sends a some of

126
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,479
chances channel seizure which is um

127
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,258
low ASCII who want the boats the

128
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,729
the binary it markets what smart single

129
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,438
it's the marks ignored sense if her I am

130
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,650
ok 76 ikat

131
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,050
a about a email seconds it sends the the
mark signal

132
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,090
which is akin to continuous the ones
which he happens to be 1200 hurts so

133
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,819
that's simple enough to generate 1200
hurts

134
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,210
for that duration is no big deal I and
then

135
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,060
and is no start or stop bits for the
channel seizure it's just continuous

136
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,969
ones

137
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:34,120
and that's it the from

138
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,510
she's film

139
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,100
reasonable Thurston danced is sized

140
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,350
actually from for the first of all it is
before the

141
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,330
before that there are 30 ASCII use they
get sent which is a

142
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,880
equal to 55 hex which is alternate if
you look at it

143
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,330
in binary its 30 ask EU's

144
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,220
the you is a in binary its alternating
zeros and ones starting with 0

145
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,770
at the beginning at the bit in ending
with the one and that part if it does

146
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,319
have

147
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,820
I am start and stop bits to it

148
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,800
then after that point he goes on to the
Mart signal

149
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,230
I for about email seconds and then it
goes on to the data

150
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,290
the I am

151
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,050
d these a.m. DMF which is mall

152
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,370
this two types love the message types

153
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,040
there was the original on which was s SM
DMF single message datum

154
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,630
a single data message format St MFN

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,590
yeah a that one would not send the name

156
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,780
the then he was MD MS multi data message
form and that sends the name number

157
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,400
and stable send dating time with each

158
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,590
caller ID so most boxes will set the
date and time to whatever caller ID data

159
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,240
that was sent to them

160
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,800
I some have a facility to

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,840
a habit set your own Dame time that you
want to end it just ignores that

162
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,490
other than that the

163
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,840
the call call waiting I D

164
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,660
it has something called the sass which
is its stance per subscriber alert

165
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,550
signal

166
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,470
this is the cold but that sister Holly
yeah that's the

167
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,730
same thing is the rest and a call
waiting Tony you were here

168
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,020
whether you had call waiting i dear not
if you have call waiting

169
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,360
that's just the standard Tony here
that's to work its to Subscriber alerts

170
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,670
in Los posts to

171
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,890
inform the subscriber that they have
another call

172
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,150
after that is the CAS which stands for

173
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,110
customer premise equipment alert signal
the

174
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,990
and it's basically with the CAS is is it
it's two frequencies

175
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,600
and it tells the caller ID box that yet
he I have data coming up

176
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,180
so listen up the cast stone is

177
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,590
the 20 is to frequencies it's actually a
jewel tone multi-frequency tone but it's

178
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,950
not the standard DTMF

179
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,950
frequency from like the keypad or
anything its

180
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,040
combination of frequencies is 2,130
hurts and

181
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,699
2,750 hurts and the duration is 80 mil
seconds long

182
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,990
that and the sass 3 no

183
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,670
'em and the sass frequency which comes
before that

184
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,020
is 440 hurts and it lasts for three
hundred milliseconds long

185
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,500
after that there's a touch-tone
acknowledgement from the Call Waiting

186
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,710
box

187
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,780
after the basically for the call waiting
box

188
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,949
to decode call waiting it really
couldn't care less

189
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,050
if there was a year cast stone it only

190
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,240
I mean if there was a SASE Tony could
care less it only cares if there was a

191
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,640
cast stone

192
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,240
when he hears the cast stone its sensing
acknowledgements back to the phone

193
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,970
company

194
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,100
and depending whether it's type 2 caller
ID

195
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,090
or type 3 caller ID is the tone it sends
taped to his DTMF

196
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:11,250
letter D which is the frequency is 941
hurts and 1000 633 hurts

197
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,360
and type 3 is the the letter DTMF a day

198
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,170
and stats 697 hurts and 1000 633 hurts

199
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,760
after the some the acknowledgement tone

200
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,160
there's silence and then the FSK begins
after that

201
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,199
I am

202
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,440
so with the FSK defs k4

203
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,170
them caller ID thank all waiting ID is
different in the beginning

204
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,640
there is no channel see here because

205
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,980
its array listening and everything I am

206
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,370
and pretty much she just goes into mark
signal

207
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,200
and then it goes into the data

208
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,200
dear arm there are different types of
messages that can be sent

209
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,270
and that has to do with the type a the

210
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,970
the some assignments

211
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,520
28 in the it's in the beginning it would
be a tells it what kinda

212
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,090
update is coming up

213
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,170
the some

214
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,500
for caller ID regular caller ID

215
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,800
has it occurs between the first and
second ring

216
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,940
and it can't go Lenny longer and yet biz

217
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,380
time before and after the caller ID
where has to be totally silent

218
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,020
I for to adhere to the protocol

219
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,530
there's something called talk of that
can occur with

220
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,550
the the phones and a

221
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,870
and call waiting I D boxes and stuff
like that

222
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,090
if someone's talking in their voice
happens to

223
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,350
reach a certain frequency the box my
mistakenly think

224
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,460
that it just heard a cast stone and it's
going to we're

225
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,110
sit there and it mutes the phone

226
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,660
see now the persons just sitting there
and

227
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,650
its its silent the a.m. it's totally
muted but because it that

228
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,770
the the caller ID boxes have something
call

229
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,120
they have a talk of they have a time
limit the timeout limit

230
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,230
if no data was heard in five hundred in
10 seconds about

231
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,670
then it just on newt's it in resumes

232
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,120
to what it was that I

233
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,120

America to tonya year

262
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:24,459
there he got it working and guide

263
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:32,660
way

264
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,419
I

265
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,919
enough good you can type very well but

266
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,809
no actually a detailed fine I guess
there is another error in the program

267
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,620
and that's of her lunchbox worries the
say that

268
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,250
yeah there with him

269
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,109
yeah

270
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:01,249
yes it it generates the caller ID signal

271
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:05,580
that the phone company would to believe
that the phone company would regularly

272
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,749
degenerate then you see I there hun
display

273
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:12,919
yet

274
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,639
and baby you can send me the name for
calling in on them

275
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:21,369
high school the sky boxes near buildings

276
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,408
generating so I what Yahoo

277
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,019
3 type twos call waiting I D

278
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,159
other this is not type 3 caller ID

279
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,529
why didn't you answer image rendering
now this is

280
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:38,609
type to which is call waiting ID so it
can be anytime during the call

281
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:43,210
all that happens is it sends the
subscriber alert signal which is

282
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,779
it's not necessary for the caller ID
purposes it's just the same thing you

283
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,179
have when you have call waiting

284
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,019
at all whether you have caller ID or not
then comes the

285
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,059
the the customer premise equipment alert
signal

286
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:58,299
that frequent that those two frequencies
there

287
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,460
that tells the box to that date this
sunday coming up

288
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,950
and in the box acknowledges it with the
touchstone

289
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,269
and steny acted as touchstone is the

290
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:12,320
short hair to silence their lead and
then the data goes on

291
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,759
and that's the day the C the date the
time

292
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,499
name the number all that goes over um

293
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:23,389
the date and time always go over
obviously the name and number don't

294
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,109
necessarily have to go over

295
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:28,408
you can also have private number

296
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:35,080
are you know the number again yet well

297
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,699
star 69 is just it see that you not
telling the phone company

298
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,559
that this is the number that called be
telling the other box so if you do star

299
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,580
69 at

300
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,570
it's just skinny get the last call back
has nothing to do with it

301
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,839
yet wire ha he

302
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,859
hotline okay here's the thing you cannot

303
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,408
hook up the phone the the you don't
wanna hook it up directly to the phone

304
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,830
line because you will fryer Quitman

305
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,019
what you wanna do is you want to use an
interface

306
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,389
a Saab has an interface that's in the
help file

307
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:15,339
I didn't happen to use the interface I
built mine long for Saab

308
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:20,570
had an interface their I got mine from I
believe you is at a popular electronics

309
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,408
magazine I saw an article there

310
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:26,320
and I tried that out at work great or
trade tripling

311
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,939
okay

312
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,150
XOM real

313
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:42,150
if whites are yes

314
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,060
previous year but this something that
some people do is they'll try and bounce

315
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,139
they'll keep sending messages and tryin
over

316
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,390
overflow the buffer so there's not going
to be

317
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,770
their original one in there anymore
swirl for you now is

318
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,460
99 she's do you

319
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,820
he offered for you to hold her own
that's where we going to happen

320
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,550
euros that app that so easy and discuss
yeah and spoke /a in a hundred years I'm

321
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,530
my mind for them

322
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,129
okay here's a here's the thing caller ID

323
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,710
has to be between first and second ring
so what that means to you

324
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,730
is day unless you're clipping directly
to someone's phone line you cannot spoof

325
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,950
caller ID type 1 except

326
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,520
shot there are some older boxes they use
a Motorola IC chip

327
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,700
and this ship is known to have a flaw
and you can send it all you want

328
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,960
if its key figure in a certain way %um

329
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,900
you want upon No well basically he it

330
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,160
it is with the mall you can't do it

331
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,320
acceptance under two conditions either

332
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,689
with the Motorola chipped in it doesn't
matter you could be in the middle of a

333
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,550
phone call and send it but that's a flaw
in the chip that's not the standard

334
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,820
think it's not supposed to be that way
one tell me if missus clinton's

335
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,110
your number yahoo.com

336
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,080
correct yeah curriculum

337
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,179
this interface you had tonight they
insist that

338
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,040
itself audio interface that it isolates
the phone line from the audio clip:

339
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,840
mints ok for

340
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,149
well there is a transformer in there
what it does is it protects the phone

341
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,880
line from my equipment protective

342
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,770
Mike women from the phone line cuz if
the phone rings this high voltage is

343
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,790
there that'll Friday equipment as well

344
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,379
it consists so for one transformer one
capacitor and

345
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,860
two resistors and it's basically the
design in the in the magazine

346
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,480
called for a switch I decided not to use
a switch

347
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,080
I just wired it the two separate wires

348
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,360
and labeled each one what they are and

349
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,780
I find that to be much better anyway but
a

350
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,700
the actual components of his
unfortunately I didn't bring the

351
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,180
the value is with me so I don't know
what they are off and i cant talk about

352
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,230
amendment we're actually can extend this
deadly in 30 sir

353
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,210
there's the another thing you can do to

354
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,000
but Tesco waiting I D if you don't have
the phone line handy in you just wanna

355
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,530
Tesco waiting Angie you can simply build

356
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,680
very cheap easy to build phone line
interface

357
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,800
what it consists of is a nine volt
battery and it could be one resistor I

358
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,800
chose to use to just cuz the
availability of them

359
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,250
normally could use one 300 ohm resistor

360
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,400
and you would wired in series and

361
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,500
I'd chose to use instead I chose to

362
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,050
150 ohm resistors and and wired in
series on either side to the battery

363
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,740
and I'm basically

364
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,350
the the wiring is that the the red wire

365
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,000
is the one where you gonna have the
resistor on it and the

366
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,470
greenwire is going to connect directly
to the other green wire

367
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,930
with my use the full I use the duplex
Jack

368
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,970
select a wired easily and on the top
like a plugin one

369
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,270
thing in the bottom Mike a plugin
another its okay so lonely work with

370
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,560
call waiting ID so he is lucky on a
night

371
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,110
I well as you know

372
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,520
like he's re: said you can actually
spoof the number when you're placing the

373
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,040
call

374
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,270
sure that so y'all Leona CIA alright

375
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,910
all this is a I'm gonna be talking about
a conspiracy the actual number calling

376
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,570
from when you place a phone call

377
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,700
first thing you know what automatic
number identification is

378
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,880
and I basically

379
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,810
it was developed by the phone companies
long before caller ID was

380
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,590
it was originally used for billing
purposes and I

381
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,129
the whenever you place a call

382
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,540
you can't block it it into and the
switch always transmits wanna me a call

383
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,100
into

384
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,680
to the Siemens which the your card from
on the phone company

385
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,730
so you know when you call 911 they're
going to have your phone number

386
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,410
and it's got a database a 911 that
reverses at: address

387
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,300
so that so they have your it address and
all that information

388
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,860
and I'm and I was a

389
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,990
a members made available the toll-free
like eight hundred-numbers

390
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,720
basically because a when you call a
toll-free number

391
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,820
it's free to you not so they
hundred-number I'll when

392
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,000
and based on location a bill that 800
number for where you're calling from

393
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,680
on see

394
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,550
there's a they recently made

395
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,940
different changes today and I used to be
that just say your phone number

396
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,030
now they send two digits along with it
that's a

397
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,950
they say what that the phone it is yeah
I like a prisoner hotel a payphone

398
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,000
arm basically

399
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,130
you can you can cause an and I fail

400
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,410
which is a EA EA

401
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,340
call your local operator you have read a
ver to an eight hundred-number

402
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,710
it eloy call the local office a little
to say on a number she calls it

403
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,940
said the your number showing up little
to show your area code an hour

404
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,800
because this is a a use for billing
purposes you could

405
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,010
basically have your operator dialer an
eight hundred number for

406
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,000
major phone company on the phone to me
I'm talking about today is tell us

407
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,020
in Canada I hit disk it could you give
me a little more I mean I have to

408
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,830
demonstrate this man

409
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:50,350
alright at yeah the and tell us think
Canada um

410
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,450
that if you'd at the OPT ever to them
the last number you calling from

411
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,350
you can give them any phone number you
want and then year you basically telling

412
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,470
my

413

yeah I one up I wanna place a call to
this number

414
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,390
and you get depending on what bill using
you can say collector whatever

415
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,220
when they call the called party it'll
show the earth it a shot at a show the

416
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,380
false the number

417
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,810
that you gave te list and I'm

418
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,639
you get you can also social engineer
them you don't have to call collect

419
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,540
you can social engineer them say your
technician and I

420
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,600
you need a place a test call this phone
number they'll call the number direct

421
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,390
the spirit caller ID all show up now I
only got two minutes

422
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,630
but a I'm gonna try and make this quick
I'm gonna cause a quick and he failed to

423
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,690
tell ist

424
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,320
I'm gonna have them call this phone
number here

425
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,820
and it should show the car it should
show this proved number that I say I'm

426
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,780
coming from

427
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,020
it's going to be collected obviously
online doing it all for a

428
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,210
now the

429
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:58,210
did

430
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:12,990
has become UK he you

431
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,189

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,170
okay I

437
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,850
yeah of back oh there is

438
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,220
yeah on could just place a quick test
call for me they're not just call a

439
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,810
direct

440
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:55,810
okay your of about 20 km

441
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,660
operator with in 20 I 31 I

442
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,340
that's correct um

443
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:10,340
hold on one second

444
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,540
I'm sorry operator I gave you the wrong
number when you try a collect call to

445
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,290
this number

446
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,300
here yes 212 279

447
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,520
71 7 9 I

448
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,350
okay 0 they are no no I'm sorry 717 ball

449
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,500
operator you can call 717 8 I

450
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,910
invoking I 7178

451
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:46,760
okay

452
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,390
gone okay

453
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:55,630
I get to try to 12 /7/ 365 thousand

454
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,870
know I can leave but yeah I'm call back
you

455
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,870

if that doesn't work I'm sorry you know
it

459
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,730
it does work I could I could call my
cell phone but I don't want to give that

460
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,510
number out

461
