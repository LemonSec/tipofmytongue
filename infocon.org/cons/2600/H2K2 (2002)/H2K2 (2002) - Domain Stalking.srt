2011 course competition

223
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,800
I

224
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,350
with this information there

225
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,269
do not do PowerPoint presentations at
three o'clock in the morning

226
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:37,850
I gotta a week's notice that I was going
to be doing this

227
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,360
problems I run into are 10 your domains
recently expanded

228
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,570
how long you you were to me sp two years

229
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,710
now ten years

230
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,420
Canada it'll be doing this 2012 and 11

231
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,430
so

232
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,560
and the process is probably a little bit
say but know people are still ringing

233
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,269
for 12 years

234
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,940
just forgetting about it special a small
companies because they don't have a

235
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,060
directed mister person

236
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,880
large companies alive churn

237
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,500
building

238
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,340
nobody gets

239
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,480
the letter solutions

240
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,010
another interesting side thing

241
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,890
who remembers the whole Verizon sucks
issue

242
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,689

oxford shirt my successor wanted to buy
rise

245
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,240
rise insights well rise and

246
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,360
a step ahead and register right sucks
and about 700

247
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,400
other domains

248
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,670

sucks and Adam

250
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,270
nasty gram in the mail horizon

251
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,430
I don't what to know the mailman
delivers their male

252
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,650

once so they would have gotten 700

253
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,360
letters

254
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,380
from networkers from network solutions

255
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,590
I'm not talking about you know
mistakenly said no

256
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,870
but they actually ignore that for

257
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,980
almost three months

258
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,679
and made for the finally

259
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,010
had

260
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,400
lines like

261
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,600
very reasonably could've had rise in
sight stock call

262
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,160
as a prominent is a fact that never
sleeps

263
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,569
shins is a bunch of crooks to break
their own rules and don't the week

264
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,619
the means when this post it

265
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:36,320
i've seen domains still better expire
back in

266
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,690
November not been deleted I can pick
them up i cant final

267
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,060
which really sucks is actually a my
sister but that

268
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,180
last year issue

that expire for almost two years

271
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,240
like most other thing

272
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,590
universal me

273
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,839
I

274
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,670
yours the main dispute

275
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,540
resolution

276
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,130
generally does not favor people

277
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,260
individuals and minds think

278
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,370
more

279
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm not a lawyer I don't have a lawyer I
really don't wanna do

280
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,769
labels so

281
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,300
the concerns

282
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,540
target who should you be targeting

283
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,000
people who are worth millions

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,470
need to pick a target makes sense

285
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,360

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,930
owners manuals stopping what he's doing

those guys

292
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,779
needed

293
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,560
school

294
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,600

00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,760
that Kennedy should also be in there

297
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,670
but you know if there's some Chinese
domain

298
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,089
spammers will be another one

299
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,759
these companies are selling

300
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,810

but I still can register how long

399
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,730
you have to wait for the that very I
generally

400
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,060
rules are forty five days

401
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,629
as soon as the thing comes up for
renewal

402
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,539
it still works

403
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,809
depends on the company but usually it's

404
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:13,940
for a month

405
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,749
still works dollars you know this is

406
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,850
after that

407
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,380
they might unplug it other jail after 45
days

408
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,610

a minute if its network solutions they
don't like the fact that other people

413
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,340
and we forgive me expire register
somebody else

414
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,639
say basically break their own

415
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,460
hold on to these domains for as long as
they possibly can

416
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,660
sometimes like three four five months
just cost

417
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,490
day the company

418
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,580

426
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,520
napping is that there's holding

427
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,280

money

430
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:32,668
exactly but they don't wants to let it
go with the thought that it might just

431
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:34,539
end up with somebody else's register

432
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:37,720

system its somebody else's wall

523
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,279
realistically they don't have to give me

524
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,140
by

525

know if you get the present all its

526
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,860
in the best interests to at least here
nice

527
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,970
a product with semantic any web prospect

528
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,750
like it organized I like that expire but

529
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,730
they have day for years Lego

530
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,470
they just

531
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,809
let it go

532
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,410
for 20 bucks any

533
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,000
years worth keeping up that intellectual
property

534
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,940
if they can't be bothered to you

535
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,789
I'm really curious but legal status they
let it go

536
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:31,990
we grab it I don't think they've got any
recourse

537
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,070
obviously they don't care about it
anymore can say

538
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,750
Cyrus water

539
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,410
illegals

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,120
details best

541
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,700
10 minutes left

542
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,900
arm

543
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,310
guy from

544
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,100
around

545
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,630
alter

546
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,840
the alternate DNS

547
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,320
you know

548
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,889

like player this him

550
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:15,080
network solutions figure out was
responsible

551
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,050
I think I should also think manual

552
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,220
all the volunteers everybody one helluva
hard

553

actually staying away well suffer this
comes down here

555
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,340
other areas

556
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:41,340
I'm surprised I survived

557
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,020
I did not know the next CA guys to bring
or in the morning

558
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:52,020
I'm I'm hurting something fierce right
now

559
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,260
emails

560
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,110
in a game you say

561
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:05,890
I was a hi mom for the official record

562
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:09,170
you're a runner lab is through today

563
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,030
you just ask who uses a register I was
in a follow up and say a

564
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,010
a lot of people that's especially with
Canadian

565
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,620
or companies out there but a lotta
Canadian

566
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,870
registrars have been very good about
protecting the privacy

567
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,290
and not disclosing as opposition

568
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,649
names was an American company RSA a
lawyer

569
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,380
a these people at this site there give
me a hard time a lot of people talk

570
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,870
you never want to register register
common solutions

571
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,200
but a lotta Canadian registrars Billy no
at all I have heard of some

572
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,780
like problems with these guys just
possibles they aren't that bright

573
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,970
try to explain to them

574
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,180
will have here web server on

575
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,570
this IP by your MX records by somebody
else

576
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,958
just

577
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:58,320
unless they're doing at all

578
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,879
but just as a registrar there

579
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,520
is it's just a matter able

580
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,690
one else

581
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,789
comment

582
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:15,660
bashing critiques

583
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,440
I got the

584
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,630
term

585
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,570
does bullshit

586
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,678
I said I got this letter here

587
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,429
baggage handlers were very nice to me

588
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:33,320
customs

589
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,279
there was

590
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,080
80 hey I heard talk about the who is
stuffing is what a line on

591
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,320
Bulgarian founder namespaces through the
media and and

592
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,830
actually par the thing with the who is
now is Verisign to send out

593
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,510
letters that if anyone wants to update
their contact information with them

594
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,059
they have to do it through web-based
control panel and

595
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:59,379
they will mail you your password via
snail mail and I think this has a lot to

596
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,039
do with homeland defense because

597
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,549
what they need to do what they're trying
to establish is a

598
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,769
land address for you and tied it to your
IP

599
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:13,470
use because of course when you log into
the website where they get

600
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,240
right

601
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,309
and then when you had your snail mail
whether they get right and when they

602
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:19,820
talk to your ISP

603
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,000
especially if it's a oh well what they
have on the other end to their modem

604
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,550
caller ID you're dialing it so

605
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,669
they had called your contact information
down to you and they can identify who is

606
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,740
down individual so not only does it have
an implication

607
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,860
for spying surveillance or other kinda
so-called

608
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,110
accountability but also helps the
trademark people in force

609
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,510
awesome things like that come after
worse

610
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,480
so what we set up a with namespace

611
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,900
is we were the first one of the first 29
companies to be credited

612
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,720
squirm close for the I can registry when
I read the contract

613
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,570
I saw as the Registrar contract the
mandatory

614
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,908
database escrow requirements meaning one
every week

615
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:07,159
once a week if your registrar you have
to present

616
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,840
I came or one of their so-called
accepted agents

617
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,480
a full and complete day listing every
day to feel that they require in the

618
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,299
contract down to the credit card number

619
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:21,530
for everything for the individuals

620
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,610
to them once a week so what we did

621
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,830
it was not to go forward besides the
fact that we had to close a hundred

622
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,449
thousand dollar bonds and to network
solutions so they could cause

623
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,809
draw for credit account we decide to

624
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,440
by from another resellers

625
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,010
rather than directly interface with an
SI registry and what this

626
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:46,600
did is the registrar that we buy from
slightly elevated wholesale price but

627
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,520
they have to turn over there

628
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,220
WHOIS database we don't

629
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,380
so people register with us we can act as
agent rocks

630
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,610
so the new service for developing we'll
have the whole

631
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,020
software background on for your call
anonymous aid

632
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,000
800 .org and so we would

633
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,520
then the the land-based who is
information on happen

634
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,629
course we our Privacy Policy is no but
at sardi's

635
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:19,630
even if they come knocking on our door
so because we believe that

636
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,590
privacy is essential and

637
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,080
that not Indus making profit of like ya
who is selling to spammers and things

638
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,549
like that

639
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:35,200
so we chose to take that extra little
obstacle

640
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,909
in in the way user

641
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:40,630
the middle company in order to exempt
ourselves

642
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,780
from having to sign a contract that says
have to compromise everyone ever

643
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,770
customers privacy when violates our own
policy in

644
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,299
not on seal and probably not yet but I
should probably find the

645
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:55,009
a guy out here and

646
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:59,309
talked about and also we need to raise
enough money so we can

647
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,320
parser so I no think about supporting us
we have a

648
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,749
service whole move my dot com soulful

return as a said

657
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,940

March 1997 the

661
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,399
namespace March 11 1997 I signed a
letter on behalf

662
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,730
namespace to network solutions basically
announcing that

663
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:04,360
where their competition and handed him a
printout of about 350

664
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,480
top-level domains like dot socks .info
Donard

665
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,800
Titans Center and Aston to him put those
into the root zone

666
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,810
so they would work on an equal playing
field with dot com well

667
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,929
the phone call that we're trying to play
back your was when they called back

668
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:22,810
and it's the Dave graves head of
operations

669
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,250
bills Barbaro outside general counsel a
and the

670
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,469
my former attorney Michael Donovan

671
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,610
and through the conversation basically
what was established was there was no

672
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,460
contractual chain of command over the
room

673
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,250
and when they referred a request back to
Jon Postel Michael Donovan

674
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:42,980
very

675
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,340
astutely ask them you have a contract
with Diana

676
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,750
and

677
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,080
bills farmer response we have a contract
with Diana

678
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,480
no we don't have a contract so

679
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,740
and then they went on further a

680
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,710
but that's just the way things are done
here but in law

681
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,300
actually there needs to be an articulate
chain command so a

682
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,130
the next question was will who actually
inputs the change in the room and your

683
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,510
guy

684
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,130
pentagon the background is do and he
said

685
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,950
I guess we do and we said well that's
our point because

686
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,950
you guys

687
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,359
input the change in according to the
cooperative agreement a

688
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,260
you have the discretionary power to make
this change sonny with a chose not to so

689
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,990
we were forced to file an anti-trust
action was

690
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,190
filed on March 28 1997 which is modeled
after MCI versus AT&T

691
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,480
now we all know the phone

692
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,090
student audience in this here we have on

693
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,920
that MCI versus AT&T broke up the phone
company allowed for the growth that the

694
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,270
internet has allowed people plus device

695
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,780
line that's why group in this case

696
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:58,530
after three years litigation annis I was
given immunity

697
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,609
and US government stepped in asserted
their authority over

698
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,410
which didn't exist

699
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,500
back we argue that

700
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,530
firms within the industry professor her

701
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:14,490
and law school

702
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,630
somehow there's a corrupt file

703
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,820
is net

704
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,119
ironic that in a size file is corrupt
well

705
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,190
that's life

706
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,730
it's on that CD

707
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,110
somebody else wanna give it a try

708
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,170
rights

709
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,980
things I

710
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,010
so what happen anyway Court of Appeals k
Venice I'm unity

711
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:41,119
and but US government stepped forward
and articulated their party over the

712
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,200
room although we argue that no
government has authority

713
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,690
this is a global commons everybody hears
this idea about

714
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,530
digital comments back

715
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,230
according to the

716
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,799
general accounting office since the
United States for the doctor research

717
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,930
that day only

718
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,819
so

719
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,540
US alone

720
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,279
specifically the Department of Commerce
national telecommunications and

721
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,360
infrastructure 80 in CIA

722
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,940
owns the room so don't believe the hype
and smoke-and-mirrors about I can

723
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,590
because all I can is contractor it's
about to lose their contract come

724
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,560
September busting failed in their
mission

725
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,240
basically to oversee addition new to me
what did they do

726
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,010
they restricted to supply the came up
with seven ridiculous choices

727
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:29,190
stole three domains from namespace which
we saw publication or .info done prone

728
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,890

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,099
country

773
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:35,390
surfers

check

778
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,920
so that's a would basically say we do it
we're told

779
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,490
even though they didn't have a contract
they went on for more they were trying

780
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,130
to find out technical details about the
content

781
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,220
miles but it's not really her basically
is that was there was no articulation

782
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,740
command and this is the %uh that have
not cut

783
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:32,740
saw the files and bypass case in the
government

785
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,470
are actually you know what look every
claim

786
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,730
a dotnet as an mp3 hiding in the bowels
somewhere not put a visible link to it

787
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,440
because I never

788
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,130
published it online actually I think
this is the first time

789
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,180
no kidding that it's ever been played
publicly that

790
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,680
that recording

791
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,368
up to this point I never disclosed

792
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:08,340
reclaim the dotnet reklame dot dot net
my teacher

793

00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,280
I guess I cover all the bases guy

796
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,410
