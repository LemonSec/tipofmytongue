1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
many other people are but I must say it
is it's really cool

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,859
arm you know just I'm just one person
and I'm not particularly

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,900
arm special you know any more than any
other

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,730
love you in this room or anyone on the
planet were all unique individuals in we

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,330
all have the power to make choices

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,510
that can change our lives in the people
around us

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,380
and why not try so

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,490
from along the way our TV going kinda
took over my life

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,890
and I learned a whole bunch of things
about how to run a business

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,969
made a lot of mistakes and I'm gonna
share

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,739
a summer that with you and also some
other things I've done right

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,230
and hopefully boiled down with make
sense so I'm

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,230
for small don't just pick a project that
you think might be an OK kinda cool way

14
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:52,079
to make money

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,770
this project if it succeeds is going to
take over your life

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,920
really totally take over your life and
if you don't love it the ups and downs

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,989
have the thing

18
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:05,269
are going to be an incredible roller
coaster the ups of course are wonderful

19
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,250
but the downs

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,070
you won't get through them II there were
times when the downs I didn't know I was

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,080
gonna get through this but knowing that
it's something that I loved allowed me

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
to get through it and

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,759
it's amazing the lows are a bomber the
highs are incredible and

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,130
knowing it's something you love is just
what carries least that's what carried

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,048
me through

26
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,100
so um see yet

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,060
so there's a

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,320
kinda weird process love coming up with
ideas like where two ideas come from

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,130
anyways

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,860
you know the ether your own creative
genius

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,409
a some bizarre Muse floating around
shooting arrows

32
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,860
I don't know but ideas come around and
on

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,579
you know it for me it's a process of
inventing which

34
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,579
is really three steps

35
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,210
you see a problem you wanna self

36
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,670
and for me it was seeing TV's popping up
all over the place in public places that

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,090
were really annoying me

38
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,590
and on then coming up with an idea

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,160
how to sell their problem like obviously
a universal remote control with one

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,480
button to turn them off

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,670
and Om than the last Sep

42
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,150
is up you know implementing and bring it
into reality

43
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,739
a the last step is really what I'm gonna
be talking about because the for two

44
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:26,520
steps

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,450
I really totally mysterious arm the idea
and then the solution to it is

46
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,940
some Bazaar thing and they come these
ideas

47
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,970
and when an idea comes what do you do
with it

48
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,330
I see you've got two choices

49
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,950
the idea if it's in there and it needs
to come out in the world all sit there

50
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,879
and just scream at you I need to come
out I need to come out

51
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,530
and you can fight it or you can go with
it so many people who are

52
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,209
otherwise could be good inventors they
have all these cool ideas

53
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,540
but they just fight all the time coming
up for so many reasons why they

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,010
really can't do it because they're doing
all these other things or

55
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,230
they're not good enough for whatever we
come up with all these reasons not to do

56
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,980
something

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,429
that we think might be really cool arm
you know but speak on says about that

58
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,379
listen to those weird little things
spinning around in your head

59
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,349
cuz if you fight it the fighting
yourself

60
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,390
and if you find yourself you know who
loses

61
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,280
so arm my fight it go with it

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,700
see what happens could be cool so once
you have a an idea that you know you

63
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,180
wanna bring into reality

64
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,390
there's a bunch of things that a

65
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,140
you might think I love I love better
obvious to think about

66
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,280
on other things that aren't so obvious
to think about

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,000
and these are some things that I've ball
down from my process that took a little

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,030
bit more than

69
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,090
one slides worth have time but a

70
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,189
I can put in one's lifetime now arm you
know to do a project that you're

71
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:59,260
actually gonna succeed in getting on the
world you want to keep it as simple as

72
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,069
possible

73
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,860
arm in on in here I'm using the TV on
his example if an idea you have is

74
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,069
software or craft or whatever to be
somewhat different process

75
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,830
but some for me I'm a hardware DK always
have been so having a

76
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,840
a little microcontroller projects in
bringing it into the world through

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,299
manufacturing processes well show you

78
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:23,690
if you have projects that have a a you
know your own analogous process

79
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,040
arm there's still a lot to be learned
from using TV gone as an example

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,040
TV gone is about as simple a project to
manufacture as possible

81
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,570
and it's a lot work but it's a lot of
fun too

82
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,599
so hopefully he'll catch that is I'm
telling you the downsides as well

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,400
arm but some other things that you want
to think about is

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,509
you know the user interface this is
something people are going to use

85
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,620
I want to have something that helps
people in their lives

86
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,100
it's got to be really really simple and
I don't wanna have to like those old

87
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,900
Casio watches it may be alive you've
heard about

88
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,289
universal remote control you have to
program it for each

89
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,020
TV you wanna turn off and by bother
doing anything else with it

90
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,789
when you can turn it off but some arm

91
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:13,840
so I just have one button just sends out
of codes one right after the other and

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,860
eventually the TV in front if you will
find its of code that we translate to in

93
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,229
terms of

94
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:24,159
so one button totally simple are what's
the form

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
well that weird smiley face the
beginning was my first idea

96
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,820
but when I a when friends are mine
wanted a TV gone and

97
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,900
I was doing it for me but when friends
wanted it and then when

98
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,350
their friends wanted when their friends
wanted I thought why I should make a

99
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,320
bunch to these

100
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,550
there should be at least some thousands
of people that are whack enough like me

101
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,030
to want

102
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,400
is so but my first idea was to have a
button

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,440
sort of a perverted seventies smiley
face button

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,570
where the eyeballs were the emitters

105
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,449
that weird turn off the TV and the nose
was the activator button

106
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,580
was like three inches big and numb

107
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,580
as I was telling people about that
people are thinking Lenovo feel

108
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,698
comfortable walking into a room with
that button in turning TV's of

109
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,449
so I came up with his other idea with a
friend of mine who is just entering our

110
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:14,810
Design School

111
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,050
and it's the Batman like case the CE

112
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,630
on the right at the screen and Dom

113
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,159
you know one button remote control key
chain so

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,350
you know and then know what color to
make it a bomb

115
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,830
blacks kinda nice instill fear in the
Batman like car

116
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,409
a image goes along with black I N

117
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,580
you know how are you gonna implemented
obviously you want to keep it simple

118
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,000
I've learned arm

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,340
all my life how to use microcontrollers
effective leaders

120
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,270
a in with the microcontroller you just
need to program it

121
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,549
Lincoln infrared emitter the right way
it's all I need is an infrared emitter

122
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,060
a button a battery in a microcontroller
something simple enough

123
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,009
why go through other contortions when I
can do it simply

124
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,819
and noms the tasks to do

125
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,840
arm lot things you need to do when you
make

126
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,910
a a project that you actually want other
people to use if you wanna sell it

127
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,030
there's even more things you need to do

128
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,370
and I'm really glad I did not know how

129
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,770
difficult all those things would have
been %uh mice he might not have done it

130
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,840
but I'm really glad I did so I hope by
telling you all these things that need

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,789
to be done it won't scare you away

132
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:29,080
arm because it really is amazingly cool

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,389
to put your project out in the world and
if other people like it

134
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,080
and you get up you know you change
reality by putting your ID out in the

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,190
world it's it's

136
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:44,060
it's quite a trip so some going for you
altered to check it out but it is

137
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,930
a lot to do it's a lot of work and I'll
see more about that in a bit

138
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,430
but some for TV B Gone

139
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,580
I thought it would be pretty simple a
but I would have to collect of codes

140
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,960
and arm known that was one of my tasks

141
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,509
and that turned out to be a quite a big
tasks

142
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,940
but I'm gonna say more about that in a
sec to so

143
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,300
clicking the power codes designing the
case

144
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,150
designing the packaging arm are things I
thought about my task list

145
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,370
it turns out that test was gonna grow
I'll

146
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,190
more on that later too so you also need

147
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,729
a cool name in our modern world

148
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,128
that's more difficult than it used to be
cuz

149
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:34,159
TV gone it was really instantaneous when
I thought the idea when I was sitting in

150
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,450
restaurant with some friends to catch up
on

151
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,130
a life with each other we hadn't seen
each other in a while and the TV was up

152
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,958
in the corner with the sound of
distracting us who are paying attention

153
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,350
to it rather than each other

154
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,700
which is not why we were there arm we
started talking about how annoying TVs

155
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,260
were and how would be called the term of
I came up with the idea

156
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,939
instantly came up with the name as well
and it turned out that

157
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,070
no one had trademark TV be gone before

158
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,310
go figure are but you know that's one
thing you got to do anything cover name

159
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,610
is see if other people have used it

160
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,240
so TV gone you look up farm and US PTO
dot Gulf

161
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,700
everything that has ever been
trademarked before is there you can also

162
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,790
look up at your local place

163
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,180
a city a and county to see if other
people have registered it

164
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,470
you go online in google it and see many
hits you have with TB gone there were

165
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,670
0 hits that's kinda miraculous

166
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,589
usually I get like 45 or something
that's okay but if you get like a half

167
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:33,649
million

168
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,760
probably time to get another name but
not only that but it's got to be a name

169
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,480
that is not registered

170
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,220
and on the web the domain name has to be
free

171
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,820
so and it also has to be easy to
remember and easy to spell

172
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,260
so TV be gone you know when you think a
TV uganda's instantly how do you spell

173
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,709
it

174
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,350
does it have dashes arm upper/lower case
doesn't matter

175
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,269
but I'll put it with dashes without
dashes and TV dash be

176
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,640
dash gone and with only one dash in
either place you may as well register a

177
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,569
mall there only like

178
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,610
you know six seven eight bucks apiece
arm

179
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,130
that's what I did

180
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:21,070
so time in order to do something cool
you've gotta make time for it

181
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,450
we do so many things in our life that's
why I don't watch TV

182
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,709
there's no time to do anything else when
I watch TV and I wouldn't be able to do

183
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,540
TV on if i watch TV

184
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,069
so from you know there is some the
choices I make in my life you gotta make

185
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,930
your choices in your life so

186
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,579
you have to make time to explore things
you love

187
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,800
if you're going to be doing things you
love first why you gotta find out what

188
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,240
those things might be

189
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,490
and then you gotta make time to do those
things

190
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,980
arm like I said before it took away the
more time to do these house

191
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,130
for TV on then I thought a

192
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,240
but some I gave myself

193
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,010
a year to do this to turn out to be a
year and a half and fortunately I just

194
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:03,880
had

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,459
enough money to do that and in it worked
out for me

196
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,589
but it did take year and a half my life
to do this

197
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:13,920
arm in particular getting those codes

198
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,589
they don't publish them who would have
thought

199
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,690
he doesn't go online and see a mother a
few of them but

200
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,040
I had to record them from your house
from a control

201
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,250
are actually lots will now go out and
bought and up

202
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,010
I was thinking I just buy an equity data
acquisition system that took up my

203
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,829
computer in which is work

204
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:37,089
well if I had ten thousand dollars that
would've been dandy

205
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,700
but I didn't have ten thousand dollars
up

206
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,410
I had a no couple hundred maybe to spend
this

207
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,510
so um I had to make my own

208
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,050
that took several months more than I'd
planned but I was a fun process

209
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,100
and once I recorded the codes I didn't
realize how

210
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,940
varied these records were and I had to
figure out which ones are duplicates in

211
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,660
which ones were sorted to complete since

212
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,389
is this code different %uh from this
code or two

213
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:11,820
closer too far and I do have lotsa field
testing

214
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,029
fortunately field testing is a lot of
fun in this case

215
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,260
so but it takes time and some 90

216
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,519
this part in the project coming over the
idea is implementing going through there

217
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,160
some frustrations roadblocks

218
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,769
obstacles to overcome but you overcome a
min then you got tired

219
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:32,670
I don't for me anyways ives totally on a
roll with his whole thing

220
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,740
and its are taking over my life already

221
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,420
so um who is coming up with all the the
things to do

222
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,849
it was kinda overwhelming once they
started actually listing them out

223
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,940
fortunately I have a lot of friends who
are really talented individuals and

224
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,360
friends are really amazing resources

225
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,050
I could have done it all myself there'll
be a lot of things I would have to learn

226
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,839
but you don't if you have an idea that
other people are interested

227
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,510
if they're not friends before they
become friends so these are a list I

228
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,050
have

229
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,959
so my friends in perform any the tasks
that need to be done on TV gone like

230
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,649
making the printed circuit board

231
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,620
which all electronic projects the
usually have to start all the parts

232
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,399
designing the plastic Acer you like as
my friend who just entered design school

233
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,040
needed a final project

234
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,740
perfect and arm my friend you know he's
downstairs she did see to sings the blue

235
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,620
she did the

236
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,230
original graphics for it and the
graphics for the web site

237
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,089
arm having a website of course is
important and my friend

238
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:35,459
Peter and I are a originally Phil help
you do the website

239
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,060
and on and on and on all these people
and the

240
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,380
you don't with a little help from your
friends you can go a long way

241
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,720
but of course you are the one driving
the whole thing it's your vision it's

242
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,040
your project

243
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,839
and you've gotta coordinate all these
people who enters you

244
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,339
enthusiastically helping you with with
your project

245
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,699
um course there's a lot of things that I
didn't think up along the way and I'm

246
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,980
sure it'll be the same with you these
are the things I just did never think

247
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,740
about when I thought about putting a
product in the world

248
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,839
barcode do you think about bar cuz I
because we think about it a little more

249
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,410
now because we have to the bar codes
everywhere QR codes on things

250
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,380
but you know our products have a bar
code if you want to sell in the store

251
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,779
you need a barcode

252
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:25,410
where do you get a barcode he just draw
lines for the marker

253
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,389
doesn't work too well and even if you
did there is a central

254
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,110
our organization called GS one

255
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,449
something I see a front a but they are a
central international nonprofit

256
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:38,279
organization that

257
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,290
that you register with you pay in Europe
30 other extortion fee

258
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,010
and you get your own company code and
you get

259
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,630
two digits for product codes and that's
the cheapest one you get that's a

260
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,529
a hundred different products you can
sell than when

261
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:00,060
so um yeah and then package design
obviously you want a cool package

262
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,449
but one thing I didn't know about is
that the size of the package is actually

263
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,480
very important

264
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,839
if it's too small so all these people
who are buyers at stores say and they

265
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,779
really believe this so it's true

266
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,720
arm if it's too small people won't pay
more than certain amount for it

267
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,680
if it's too big then your product may
not be valuable enough to fit the

268
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,949
the perceived value of the package so
are you have to have it the right size

269
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:29,370
and there's a bunch of people talking
about that online

270
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,639
arm and then car design you know you
have this product in a beautiful package

271
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,089
but you're making it who knows you know
wherever you choose to make it

272
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,300
and you've got to put it in shipping
container shipping cartons

273
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,699
for shipping cartons have to be designed
to someone as a design knows

274
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,300
how do you do that I'll get to that in a
bit and

275
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,620
trademark it is another thing if you
have a cool name

276
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,800
you can registered on US PT ot Gove

277
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,560
it's really easy and cost three hundred
fifty dollars

278
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,709
arm and a then there's also

279
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,560
you wanna patent this thing or you wanna
make it open source to do some

280
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,190
combination of both

281
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,029
I did the normal thing back then the
which there is no open source hardware

282
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,420
are so I patented which were all
inventors are supposed to do my brothers

283
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,610
a patent attorney

284
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,540
so I want the normal routine patented
patton patent-pending

285
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,949
but it turned out to be something that
was really popular with

286
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:28,519
the hacker crowd which got me sucked
into this whole mess the change my life

287
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,570
for the better in amazing ways which is
why I'm here now

288
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,870
arm but that's where I learned about
open source

289
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,699
our software in a big way and got me to
think in a big way about

290
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,839
open source hardware and a very negative
aspects of patenting

291
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,639
because patenting in a lot of ways as
saying this is mine

292
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,380
stay away if you come near me I'm gonna
sue your ass

293
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,699
least that's the way I think I've it now
an away a lot of people that I met my

294
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:55,870
first hacker conference

295
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,019
are thought of it that way and really
got me to think about this patent thing

296
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,669
arm and making an open source has been
so perfect for me

297
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,760
and now you gotta think this through for
yourself though like what are the

298
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,119
advantages and disadvantages of patent
versus open source

299
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,500
one big disadvantage hope love patent is
that they cost like thirty forty

300
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,240
thousand dollars

301
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,039
slot money if you make it open source
free

302
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,789
also you have perhaps thousands have
some in the most enthusiastic

303
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:29,950
talented creative engineers on the
planet

304
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,520
working on your project for free and
loving it

305
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,418
giving you all this mazing Lee cool
information to make your project better

306
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,380
and then you can get more ideas from
that and share it with them in the rest

307
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,150
of the world in

308
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,700
you know it's just it gets better from
there I'm just one person

309
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,980
something else all these engineering
ideas on my own isn't as good as having

310
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,820
a world of people with an open source
project

311
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,789
arm so and when people download the
plans which I have online

312
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,470
are that year and a half a life salata
life

313
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,970
but its open source now so no one has to
go through that process again all the

314
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,960
codes are out there

315
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,250
and it's shared with the world arm and
people appreciate that when they

316
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,700
download the plans

317
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,530
I don't get a cent from that if they
make it from them out but they show

318
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,230
their friends who are totally
enthusiastic in

319
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,179
look what this thing does so call in
like a look %uh the horses just about to

320
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,000
get there and

321
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,650
I'm so you know for example arm

322
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,910
and those people might buy my kid than a
good lady at a

323
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,530
arm presently a day makes so with my
idea

324
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,020
and arm I am they made by my keychain

325
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,900
am i buy the pro which is 150 meters TVs
have of

326
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,900
and arm a don't whatever

327
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,210
everyone's happy when beam for my
project being open source

328
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,510
arm the anyways the list goes on and on
but

329
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,879
that's enough to give you an idea and

330
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,020
next idea here is

331
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,980
funding different projects cost
different amount of dollars

332
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,830
or Euros or wherever you happen to live
um

333
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,990
you know it could be its expensive but
for TV gone that year and a half that I

334
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,080
spent

335
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,139
the total amount you know as a year and
a half a life it really cost me a lot of

336
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,950
time

337
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,539
but it was I loved it so it's a great
thing to do but

338
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,850
it cost me two thousand dollars

339
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,059
at all cost me microcontroller only cost
but dollar a piece I went through a

340
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,168
bunch of them

341
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,880
arm and I had to come up with my dad
acquisition system

342
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,410
which you know just little tidbit I used
to work for

343
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,620
I started a company called three where
that makes RAID controllers

344
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,780
and i'd as did the firmware for it I
programmed microcontroller with firmware

345
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,240
and so I haven't have a development
environment for that my hacked it to do

346
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,110
data acquisition home my more info
escalator

347
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,370
a it was kinda fun so it was all

348
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,650
really cheap are your project might be

349
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,789
a little more expensive are you've got a
plan for that cuz

350
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:07,190
during the time when you working on a
project that's taking off your life you

351
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,539
don't have time to make money in other
ways

352
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,980
it's really really rough I i found for
myself and for other people I've talked

353
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,610
to to have

354
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,429
part time and certainly full-time work
and work on your project in your spare

355
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:20,740
time cuz

356
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,840
you find this takes a lot of time it
does take over your life and there's

357
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,639
just not enough time

358
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,490
so if for me i i saved up and saved up
and saved up and I have this year's

359
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,520
worth of money that

360
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,860
stretch to your behalf arm so I could
work on

361
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,169
what I loved and it turned out to be
gone was what got on a roll on what I

362
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,100
did

363
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,960
and I was lucky enough for to give me
enough money to make a living

364
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,809
and just know that this is a possibility
and arm

365
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:51,720
your project though my costs a little
more money your lifestyle might not be

366
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,350
as inexpensive as minor may be cheaper
whatever you've got a plan for all this

367
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,610
and down one option is to

368
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,330
get help from friends and family that's
what I did

369
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,600
when ike's had a stretch to a year and a
half arm

370
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,210
another option is angel funding so these
people

371
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,620
that's what they do for a living after
they've made some pilot money doing

372
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,409
maybe something I didn't like as much

373
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,480
is investing people that they like

374
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,600
are and or are doing things they think
are cool

375
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,150
so they can be a really good asset
according to people I know who've gone

376
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,320
that route

377
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,950
arm they can find other people who can
help in various ways

378
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,659
other enthusiastic so they can tell you
hey I've been through it when there's

379
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,150
the down part serve those up and down
cycles

380
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,190
arm and yeah technical way to go in
there like between

381
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,159
in a few thousand to maybe a quarter
million dollars

382
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,659
a and in arm you can get more than one
angel investor

383
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,780
another option is the Seas

384
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,600
I guess you already know my opinion %ah

385
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,980
I've worked for companies a in silly
Valley

386
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,470
like saying that a silicon valley and
the

387
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,880
he sees is the normal route to go there
the normal route

388
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,530
for VC's is for people to come over the
cool idea

389
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,280
and to get the C funding the VC's put a
lot of money and they say that you're

390
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,549
they're your friend they're totally
enthusiastic and then when things aren't

391
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:21,549
going well

392
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,270
they take over the company fire the
founders and the founders get looted

393
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,100
down the

394
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,900
nothing and you're left with nothing so

395
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,169
that's the normal route for VC's from my
opinion

396
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,570
you might have other a experiences but a

397
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,720
if your project cost so much that you
need VC's like five million or more

398
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,169
maybe that's something you want to do
maybe you can reconsider how much a

399
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:47,539
project costing come up with another way

400
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,140
are maybe you can come up with another
idea that's burning inside you

401
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,299
arm so obviously I have met my opinions
but

402
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,440
the does know that a lot of people I'll

403
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,260
lot of people have share my opinion

404
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,200
you can ask me more questions later if
you like

405
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,850
soul harm

406
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,260
you can manufacture your project I on
your own

407
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,320
once you come up with a all the tasks
that need to be done your

408
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,450
finally finished the but

409
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,240
if you're making 10,000 have these in a
month

410
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,929
a and your project involves soldering
that's a lot of soldering

411
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:36,390
I love soldering but I don't love it
that much

412
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,539
so fortunately there these companies
that exists called contract

413
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,010
manufacturers that exist all

414
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,700
are solely to manufacture other people's
projects

415
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,289
and arm there a lot of them around the
world most an hour centered around

416
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,110
Southeast Asia

417
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,840
although they exist in in Mexico in
other places well there's also some in

418
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,250
the US

419
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,570
originally wanted to do mine in the US
but it turned out that

420
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,399
they were too low quality and too
expensive that combination

421
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,799
so ugh asked everyone I knew and

422
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,760
engraver worked with and china seem to
be the place to go and it pretty much

423
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,460
still

424
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,710
is a high analyst options

425
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,779
I and II actually went to China and
visited some of my

426
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:26,480
a candidates because it's really really
important to me

427
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,559
that if I'm doing something to improve
my life

428
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,020
it necessarily improve the lives of
people around me and I'm not going to do

429
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,000
that is the expensive anyone else

430
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
even if they're in China so

431
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,180
I am really go ahead you agree with that
cuz that's not the norm in our

432
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,930
are strange empezaron wonderful planet
so

433
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,240
from you know but a you know here's

434
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,040
my criteria and a all these are really
really important I would not pick

435
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,180
personally a contract manufacturer that
didn't have all of them

436
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,280
so arm I A found

437
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,510
a couple that were really good and I
found some that were incredibly

438
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,970
amazingly horrible and I only visited
ones that gave me all the information

439
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,610
saying

440
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,250
that this they met these criteria so if
I didn't go to China

441
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,100
I wouldn't have known so actually met
the people that would be soldering my TV

442
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,590
Gagne's and pulling the

443
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,840
put cranes and pushing the buttons on
the assembly lines and arm

444
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,670
a actually sat next one

445
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,610
now I'm gonna show use a little bit
about manufacturing a a bit later see

446
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,780
can see your pictures some those people

447
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,320
arm so another thing a to think about

448
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,250
is some how do you get your product from
wherever it's manufactured

449
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,590
to wherever it is you're going to be
mailing them out to people

450
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,190
arm there these companies called freight
forwarders

451
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,760
I never heard that before but if you are
ever in a place where the port like New

452
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,510
York or San francisco-oakland

453
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,140
you see these huge ships for love
containers

454
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,720
a which fit on the back of trucks Inc
transfer the ships are

455
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,040
or arm or railroad cars called
containers and their standard sizes

456
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,060
and their companies which Phillies
containers and move them

457
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,840
anywhere on the planet with boats and
airplanes and trains and whatever is

458
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,520
necessary to get them where they're
going

459
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,470
and arm I got recommendations from
people

460
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,510
good work with and why no and found

461
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,790
are some that I like and arm

462
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,530
there's trade-offs in in this with
manufacturing

463
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,500
you know if it's in China that's a lot
further to go to ship then if you make

464
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,120
it in

465
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,160
New Jersey arm but the cost of shipping

466
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,460
from China to my warehouse in New Jersey

467
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,810
arm is a including the manufacturer and
the shipping is still way cheaper than

468
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,820
and better quality

469
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,270
then I could have done if I made in the
US arm

470
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,540
but if you want it quickly which
sometimes I need to do because people

471
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,690
want their TV guns now in their ordering
a bunch I can get him now

472
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,290
so I have to pay a dollar thirty five
apiece to get each one here

473
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,420
are if I go by boat which you know the
slow boat from China

474
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,490
those exist a cost 35 cents a piece that
way

475
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,590
if I could do a full container which
I've actually never done

476
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,980
its it's considerably cheaper arm

477
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,680
so that's a little tidbit on shipping
arm

478
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,920
here's a bit on manufacturing so just
real brief

479
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,100
when you manufacture something them and
the contract manufacturer is going to

480
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,000
help you with

481
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,020
doing a lot of things arm a few fine
when

482
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,040
that that's a good one are they order
all your parts for you

483
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,090
are they make the plastic cases from
your design

484
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,920
they can print the I am artwork for

485
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,070
what people see when they look at your
individual packages

486
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,909
they can design those shipping cartons
for you and

487
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:10,010
arm a make the Prince circuit boards and
put the whole thing together put it on

488
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,680
pallets and ship it out

489
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,180
all you have to do after you get the
whole process going

490
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,100
is where the money and then pellets for
love your product magically appear like

491
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,280
a week or two later

492
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,550
at a port in the on my case Shanghai

493
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,290
and then the freight forwarders bring it
to your place where you are

494
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,580
a sell it from but here's those pictures
I talked about

495
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,889
the project managers are these happy
little guy

496
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,960
its a that's the Calvin

497
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,430
handball those are their names they're
really cool people and they love doing

498
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,430
what they do

499
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,460
the people on the assembly line I
wouldn't say they love doing what they

500
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:49,900
do

501
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,840
but the there there there pretty content
with their jobs this place trees are

502
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,950
people well

503
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,900
they train them well so they don't wanna
lose their in China they often do things

504
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,920
for the wrong reasons the right things
for the wrong reasons

505
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,330
so they're doing the right things for
what I consider not quite up to more

506
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,250
reasons but

507
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,990
they train their people they don't wanna
lose their investments will have to

508
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,730
treat them well so they don't quit and
go somewhere else

509
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,460
so so treated well they actually have
their own chef

510
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,490
and I'm a vegetarian menus like on what
what you want if you don't meet night

511
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,640
told them he made it for me insane with
everyone on the assembly line

512
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,160
so they get 3 month contracts are they
usually come from

513
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,350
various places around although the

514
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,550
in Shanghai where they do their that's a
big city so people don't have far to

515
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,480
come

516
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,270
they don't still live in the dorm but
they have three month contracts they can

517
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,760
only have two

518
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,910
few months contracts and then they have
to go but in the three months

519
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,850
they can make enough money to pay for
them in their family for a year

520
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,070
how many americans can do that so yeah

521
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,770
it given the the a scale economy is
pretty cool that way

522
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,210
arm so f you get it in its some its at

523
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:09,210
your your your place between to skip
a.m.

524
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,659
that's coming later so okay so

525
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,250
when she wanna sell it UV you know you
wanna sell it

526
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,680
what you sell it for arm

527
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,770
that's not an easy question to answer
like what is worth we

528
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,830
the parts and the manufacturing the
shipping these are all

529
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,260
very definite numbers that you know
because you paid it

530
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,560
um and some arm

531
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,750
om night it's get one thing let me just
go back a second I said it cost two

532
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,870
thousand dollars

533
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,970
a to do TV on that was to develop it

534
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,910
arm and some it actually costs me

535
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:54,180
I thirty thousand dollars once I want to
press the spend button at my contract

536
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,700
manufacturer and then to pay to ship it

537
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,410
arm and that's where again I ask for
friends and family cuz I didn't wanna re

538
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,710
going investors

539
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,180
angels and you know my opinion up he
sees

540
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,230
so arm sorry hours so but back to hear
selling at what cost

541
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,800
turm you sell it for

542
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,830
I I made the mistake as many many people
do

543
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,820
love the region levy selling my ATV gone
for two cheap

544
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,300
so I was selling them for $14.99 because
this is the United States New canceling

545
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,400
thing for fifteen dollars

546
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,240
and arm so highways designing these
whole thing's going through all the

547
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,700
manufacturing process dealing with all
the online stuff in all the stress and

548
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,280
fulfilling all orders

549
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,520
and at the end of the day up after
paying everybody that was helping that

550
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,910
long list a friends

551
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,760
after TV gone became popular suddenly
they were working

552
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,030
to make TV guns happen and I had to pay
all of them I want to pay them what they

553
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,020
were worth which is paying them well

554
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,090
so at the end of the day I got was left
which was like

555
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,470
serum 0

556
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,520
0 there was a lot of work and a lot of
stress although I love the project

557
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,150
I had to eat so um I had to raise the
price

558
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,000
so it's kinda weird making money is not
his easy as it seems that should be

559
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,760
fifteen dollars basically $14.99 arm

560
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,129
times 20,000 TV guns which is what I
actually made in

561
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,830
a they were super popular overnight
because will wear dot com article in

562
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,899
those sold in a few weeks

563
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,100
fifteen dollars times twenty thousand is
a lot of money

564
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,980
why I'm not ice am why am I not super
rich

565
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,610
well because I had to pay all those
people and at the end of the day when I

566
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,950
got what was left it was zero

567
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,130
that's why so on I raise the price to
1999 cuz

568
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,830
America you can sell it for twenty and
that was enough

569
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,880
as it turns out for me to have some
money left over

570
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,180
are at the into the after repeated one
else so

571
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,500
that was a huge surprise to me

572
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,160
so no hope you can learn something from
that and also lemme

573
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,680
I'll lady out to all the more fried and
and filter owner earlier today we're

574
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,700
talking about this

575
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,560
if you want to sell something you don't
just pick a little bit more

576
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,780
are to sell it for than what it costs
you total

577
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,720
if you wanna sell it on your website you
might be able to get away with that if

578
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,280
you don't pay anybody else

579
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,790
but you know like I said after paying
everyone else I was getting zero

580
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,928
arm if you want to sell it in stores

581
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:35,230
then you've got us pick a higher retail
price:

582
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,440
hopefully our higher retail prices
apprise people wanna pay

583
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,150
as well for TV gonna turns out that
there aren't all that many people that

584
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:48,170
don't wanna buy it for twenty that would
have for fifteen

585
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,060
but for other products: you know it
could vary and there's no hard and fast

586
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,790
rules about that but

587
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,649
there are some rules a farm about
selling products

588
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,429
a a at stores so a store in general
wants to make

589
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:05,480
money that's why they exist primarily

590
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,270
arm and often they wanna double the
price that you sell it for

591
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:14,418
or that they buy from a distributor
distributor wants to make forty percent

592
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:17,500
more then what you sell it to them for

593
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,520
so whatever you wanna sell it for has to
be enough money to pay you in all your

594
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,949
people

595
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:27,639
and then you increase it by forty
percent its

596
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,049
that's what you sell it wholesale for
not plus or minus depending on

597
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,879
a the I miss you sell higher volumes you
can bring price down

598
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,969
arm and then you have attack under that
out

599
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,740
may be double the price from their 50
percent or forty percent depending on

600
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,899
the store

601
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:48,239
be on that and that fix your retail
price and hopefully like I said that

602
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,000
surprise people want to pay

603
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,300
if it isn't think of that before you
press the spend button

604
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,320
otherwise you might have a warehouse
full of things

605
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,290
that you'll sell to some company that a
start selling them really cheap on ebay

606
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,470
so um another thing

607
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,040
website to you in some sense website
super simply just say

608
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,120
ATV going to calm myself TV ons but

609
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,069
some you really want to a website
experience ever whoever's using it to be

610
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,080
a invading and useful hand

611
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,930
easy cuz if people have to navigate
through a whole bunch pages and figure

612
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,299
out

613
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,620
okay this is really cool thing how do I
buy it if it takes them a bunch of

614
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,900
clicks to do it they might give up
before they even find it

615
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,780
so are there's my website put a lot of
thought into this by looking at lots of

616
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,470
web sites I thought were

617
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,750
I mean how many have you have ever
looked at our web-site you thought

618
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,400
sucked

619
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,290
I I think the 100 percent so um

620
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,240
we all know what not to do and we've all
probably seen web sites we thought were

621
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,350
work pretty well so that's what I did I
looked at the

622
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:03,270
view source in saudi HTML and I'll learn
some PHP and then I

623
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,690
paired my friend Chris to do the rest
because he's really good at it

624
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,720
and he made the the shopping cart arm an

625
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,020
shopping carts the really good ones now
legs and cart and

626
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,660
was ask art is that the on a and maybe a
few others

627
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,129
and but back then none of the ones that
existed were all that good for what I

628
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,920
wanted so we actually

629
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,400
went through the pain of creating our
own custom one

630
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,370
the cool thing about that our is a I can
make it do whatever I want now

631
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,520
but love people really like flow from
seeing the front page

632
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,000
actually going there in it's really easy
to do it you just click

633
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,510
buyers online for by now

634
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,000
arm you know and it's kinda weird but
it's only inviting

635
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,660
arm and the TV on no I like retro and my
friend Nina likes retro so there's the

636
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,230
retro trippy stuff

637
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,410
which are recycled for brain machines by
the way

638
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,529
attribute pattern recycling is good so

639
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,170
from go green

640
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,680
order fulfillment is another thing I
didn't put much thought into an should

641
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,529
have

642
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,910
you have a whole bunch love your
products arm

643
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,200
and a a whole buncha people may or may
not be buying it

644
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,900
%uh but if people are buying a you've
gotta put them in boxes or envelopes

645
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,100
input labels on an input postage on him
bring in the post office and get them

646
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,240
somewhere where

647
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,150
the low end up your customers if you're
doing like a handful today sure do on

648
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:27,770
your own

649
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,390
on your own I was getting thousands have
orders a day which I did not plan for

650
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,670
after that where dot com article

651
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:39,200
selling 20,000 like three and a half
weeks and

652
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,730
can use a stress I had a couple friends
with TV guns in their garages at that

653
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,490
point

654
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,930
before I found out about order
fulfilment centres and

655
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,529
arm very hired lot to their friends and
somehow we actually got

656
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,240
orders to our customers before they got
we too angry

657
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,940
you know if you're selling something and
you've got a whole bunch of angry emails

658
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,060
coming in

659
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,509
like if you get one angry mail it kinda
sucks but if you get a hundred

660
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,890
I'm in NJ I get 300 emails a day and
that sucks in

661
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,770
in and of itself but imagine evolve
those were angry ones

662
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,070
that actually happened to me when my
order fulfilment centre

663
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,320
messed up once arm so the thing is

664
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,690
order fulfilment is a real pain if you
hit if you pick

665
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,010
in order fulfilment centre which exists
solely to send

666
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,760
your product to your end customers

667
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,730
if you pick one that does at that makes
mistakes

668
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,070
you get a 180 the emails in the morning

669
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:42,090
that is we know fun arm the first

670
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,350
order fulfilment centre that I picked
made a lot of mistakes

671
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,910
so I picked another one they made even
more mistakes

672
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,470
and not only that but that second one
whenever I pointed out the mistakes they

673
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,510
would yell at me

674
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,260
that had to change fortunately at that
point one of my friends who are used to

675
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,720
live with house-made

676
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,670
a many years ago started his own
fulfillment center and I didn't even

677
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,060
know until he called me and said hey you
know you're doing TV B Gone

678
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,509
I just sort of fulfillment center to you
the think you could use me I really

679
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,650
could use more

680
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,170
and that was when that other companies
started yelling yelled at me for the

681
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,200
third time in nine you had to quit so
it's perfect timing

682
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,690
so it's been a breeze sense arm order
fulfilment

683
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,740
is an error prone process they will make
mistakes but you wanna pick a place that

684
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,760
take responsibility for their heirs and
fixes them

685
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,890
this place they have now they still make
mistakes but they are usually tell me

686
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,020
before my

687
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,820
our customers tell me angrily and even
good customers are

688
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,160
are miffed when they get something
that's wrong I'm sure you've been

689
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,379
through that yourself

690
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,980
so from there's a bit about our
fulfillment

691
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:57,990
customer support is definitely something
I did not think I've

692
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:04,990
I make a remote control with one button

693
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,960
so home just because some things easy
for you doesn't mean that it's easy for

694
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,160
the rest of the world

695
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,399
think about that when you put something
out and make sure you have someone

696
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,350
so I i don't have arm a phone that
people can call I have voicemail

697
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,420
on my website the people can call and

698
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,650
and email that is answered a rather
quickly

699
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,980
a and a boy

700
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,980
you know I'll I have in a teacher most
of my life

701
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,500
in many ways and before I was a

702
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,210
teacher professionally I used to think
that too is really there's no such thing

703
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,050
is stupid people

704
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,760
that people just need a little more time
and effort but you know stupid people

705
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,630
actually exists

706
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,650
they really really do so on

707
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,220
I and if I wasn't convinced about from
being a teacher I am definitely

708
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,650
convinced of that now

709
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,670
so on but you have to you know

710
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,390
TV B Gone is not just for intelligent
Deeks

711
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:19,710
its for the mass market and so we have
the broad spectrum of people

712
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,300
not only stupid people in the United
States but stupid people everywhere

713
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,350
and everyone everywhere so on customer
support is necessary

714
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,830
are in my friend Peter a

715
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,230
does that really well we have a whole
bunch of templates with you know

716
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,390
you mean it doesn't go thru floors and
then you just as you know

717
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,520
I'll email 3b and arm

718
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,100
sometimes though he he gets emails that
just

719
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:51,520
anger him so much to the st. call me
invent so it's my project that's my job

720
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,800
arm you know so

721
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,430
specific port you be prepared for that

722
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,640
arm publicity if your projects so

723
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,480
popular you'll get publicity whether you
want it or not

724
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,630
and TV on I was really really lucky that
I got

725
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,890
Hunza publicity you know People magazine

726
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,440
you know my picture and a full page %uh
People magazine

727
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,150
that is bizarre to life is weird

728
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,660
it's really cool so arm again New York
Times

729
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,850
spent four days with me following around
taking pictures interviewing me and

730
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,080
I'm in the front page %uh the Technology
section I'm on CBS

731
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,620
ABC NBC Fox TV news for turning off TVs

732
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,730
I mean life life is weird but

733
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:43,010
thats a once in in a lifetime kinda
thing that'll never happen to me and

734
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,130
probably never add anyone in this room

735
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,490
arm so I really really lucked out there
but the thing is

736
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,960
advertising you have to let the world
know that your product exists how do you

737
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,270
do that

738
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,330
so you know it's really really cool you
can tell everyone you know

739
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:00,370
are you could advertise with super
expensive what's way better

740
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,970
and advertising is news

741
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:09,380
so will probably have opinions have the
free press in our country

742
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,400
arm but the thing is these are
individuals who are doing their job

743
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,089
and they're doing it poorly but they do
it as best as they can and they want

744
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:17,259
ready-made

745
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,470
news if you give it to them they will
broadcast that they will print it they

746
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,700
will put it out into the world in the do
it for free

747
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,470
so write compelling stories make a
controversial even if it isn't

748
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,859
all-news really really is good news it
gets people to know about it

749
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:37,029
TV gone I was really lucky that it seems
like it should be controversy all

750
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:44,030
but its not it's just a fucking TV
turning off

751
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,980
so arm I got all the advantages ovett
being seeming to be controversy or when

752
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,470
it's actually not so people

753
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,510
other press love did they they had a
heyday with it

754
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:58,670
and I got tons a free press but even if
it's not something that's so compelling

755
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,010
to the media you give them

756
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,940
PR releases press releases arm and a

757
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,120
they printed they broadcast it and if

758
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,040
it catches on one place other places
pick up on it media viruses go out in

759
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,859
the world

760
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:16,290
bloggers pick up on it word of mouth
gets really really big

761
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,820
one thing I learned in my studies have
media literacy kind of stuff which I'm

762
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,670
up on

763
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,859
are as well as advertising people have
to hear about something in general an

764
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:26,850
average

765
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:31,259
seven times seven times before they'll
actually buy it

766
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,830
but they know they wanna buy it or not
within 30 seconds of hearing a bit

767
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,819
emotionally they just know and then you
give them just a little bit in your

768
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,730
press release

769
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:43,150
a giving the intellect enough

770
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:48,230
information to convince are to overcome
the reluctance to spend money

771
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,589
because they already know whether they
want to buy it or not you're only going

772
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:53,000
after the people that know they want to
buy it so

773
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,089
and you put it out in the world so that
they'll hear it at least seven times

774
00:44:57,089 --> 00:45:01,060
word-of-mouth newspaper arm a mention on

775
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,440
drive-time radio interview whatever
seven times some

776
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,100
they can all be the same or different
but you just wanna put it out there so

777
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,339
people here at

778
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,930
enough people here at seven times so
that your product is known

779
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:18,470
and people are buying it

780
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:23,680
if your pup if your product is popular
you pry don't answer the phone yourself

781
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,129
so I hired someone do that and

782
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:34,130
the people I picked a our little better
than that

783
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,430
so II said you know it its followers are
ups and downs

784
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,089
and and it really is arm running a
business is not

785
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:48,380
my idea I love what I totally love in
life

786
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,410
but running the business makes
everything else i do

787
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,660
possible so its way worth it

788
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,810
but there are times when hit really

789
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,850
really release Sox I mean it

790
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:04,080
really Sox arm a

791
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,990
see how am i doing for time what time is
it five minutes

792
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,950
%ah okay so a let me just tell you
quickly someone stole TV on UK

793
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,810
used to be a customer arm and I violated

794
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,779
my one rule

795
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,750
I have a rule I have one rule

796
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,069
it's really important role

797
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:31,640
you should not violate this rule

798
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,680
really you should not violate this form

799
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,049
it's important

800
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,710
this should be something you should
follow in life are but

801
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:49,690
life and business are the same because
it's your business it's your project

802
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,290
it's something you love you don't wanna

803
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:56,100
nixon people you don't like every time I
violated this rule it is bitten me badly

804
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,060
and it leads to those incredibly sucky
downtimes

805
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,370
I hope you will not violate this rule
arm

806
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:08,810
so this guy in the UK stole TV gone he
started selling it was a piece of shit

807
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,509
and I got all the angry emails I already
told you what that's like

808
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:17,089
you probably already know so anyways I A
sold to him because it seemed easy

809
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:21,109
enough but this guy was a total bully he
was a manipulative bastard

810
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:26,040
and I sold to him and it came back to
bite me that way when he said

811
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,250
you know you guys are getting these
emails and I asked him what was up is a

812
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,930
beer or give me a good enough price so I
made my own

813
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,790
and is an open source project only had
to do was copy my open source plans

814
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,550
online with a really well documented in
didn't do that he stole my trademark and

815
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,170
even ask anything about it

816
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,510
and he got a lot of me we customers
because anyways

817
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,370
it worked out all I had to do is pay a
hundred and twenty thousand dollars to a

818
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,359
lawyer

819
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:55,180
for which I got sixty percent back
because that's all you get in the UK

820
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,819
and are now all his customers are mine

821
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:04,790
so there's no guarantee that if you make
your own project even if you totally

822
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,960
love it is burning inside you to come
out that

823
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,319
it will give you enough money to make a
living but

824
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,710
what is guarantee that if you don't make
time to do what you love

825
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,210
you will definitely not be doing what
you love in your life

826
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,410
if you don't take the time and

827
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,810
a start doing

828
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,529
finding what you love and doing what you
love putting your own ideas out in the

829
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,400
world

830
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,030
you'll definitely not be making living
doing what you love and there's a

831
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,120
really good possibility cuz a lot of us
in this room

832
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,390
have already done this in this congress
arm

833
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:43,460
have figured out a way to make a living
doing our projects and does know

834
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,960
if you have a job that you don't love

835
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,290
a worse yet you don't like or even more
said that you hate there are other

836
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,589
possibilities

837
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:55,839
and like I said if you want someone to
poke you

838
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,870
contact info so

839
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:05,870
that's my rap he

840
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,480
if you have time for any questions

841
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,430
so any questions you can be

842
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,399
I'm totally willing to answer any
questions always anytime email phone

843
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,160
text whatever in person

844
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,830
abut yeah I can ask

845
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,980
what is the stupidest question you've
gotten from cuz

846
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,060
for customer support oh you have to a
mid

847
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:39,060
i was just wondering

848
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:46,030
if you noticed and immediate financial
effect after publishing the specs online

849
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,050
like a change in order volume or
anything like that after what

850
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,730
a few published the specs online Owen
once I made it open source bi

851
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,540
sales went up because more people are
telling each other where the mother

852
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,040
totally excited they're showing their
friends and many other friends are

853
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,050
buying the key chains mean you're buying
the kids

854
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:07,260
arm yeah so and more people are telling
it sold more people got those seven

855
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:07,890
times

856
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:14,000
are the of codes fairly static

857
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,050
do you have to be from time to time to
make sure that new TVs can still be

858
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:18,860
turned off

859
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,360
yes so I have to keep updating the thing
is though there's

860
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,790
something like fifty billion TVs that
have been made in the history of our

861
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,920
people on the planet almost all of them
in the last few decades

862
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,340
and I am all those have the same codes

863
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,440
even when they make new TVs so arm but

864
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,410
there's a handful have new codes every
year they come out I try to keep up with

865
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,370
it by buying your

866
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,940
from universal remote controls courting
them in adding them to my database

867
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,770
great presentation

868
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,140
anything special you did with your press
release we're dealing with the prestige

869
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,650
all that great but getting on the New
York Times

870
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:00,310
and people I mean that was just more
than an accident I'm sure that you had

871
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,890
San special insights you can share with
us about how we do it ourselves

872
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:09,549
you know after I was in all these places
in on TV I got all of these are

873
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,460
letters and emails asking me who my PR
people were

874
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:17,900
because a it was a brilliant strategy a
billion campaign

875
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:24,900
and I didn't have PR people I it was a
total fluke arm

876
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,540
it was just I was on where dot com and
it turns out that

877
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,940
where dot com people actually read where
dot com

878
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,330
arm and I'll NPR national public radio
in the US

879
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,350
listen purple read out and they called
me you

880
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:44,089
after being awake all night so I could
get the shopping cart working for the

881
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:44,970
few people that might

882
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:48,110
rewired a common maybe by this bizarre
thing and

883
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,780
no sleep and everything they did okay in
live radio interview before like poverty

884
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,750
million people in the United States

885
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:58,260
for drive time and that's when all the
other people called me

886
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,990
so I wish I could say that I plan that
cuz I'd be

887
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:07,080
amazingly brilliant but I don't think
anyone can plan something so amazingly

888
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,080
complex

889
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:14,600
and bizarre so yeah but after that then
I did hire some PR people who know how

890
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,570
do arm

891
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:20,050
brake press release is better than me
but there were people friends again

892
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,880
who who are good at this stuff who
helped I

893
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,450
when you first put together your list
your close friends that were gonna work

894
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,600
with you on this project

895
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,970
how did you determine you know is
percentages

896
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,150
hourly how did you how did you feel that
you would positively

897
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,920
you know now pay them for their efforts
'em

898
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,690
it no arm I'm kind of an anarchist term

899
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,950
and I've never really considered myself
a capitalist but we live in Oak

900
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,330
a society which is probably capitalist
so II

901
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:55,440
make you so that as best as I can and
arm you know we need money to pay rent

902
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,000
and all that stuff so

903
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,130
I figured if I making enough to live on
on in

904
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,880
and incidently I make barely enough to
live the life I live on TV behind

905
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,620
but I love the life I live so I'm making
a living doing what I love which is just

906
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,240
perfect

907
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,130
so arm it's worked out really well I
just asked my friends what they thought

908
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,400
they want to be paid and and it turned
out when I analyzed together

909
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,540
after all that paid and the shipping and
all that stuff

910
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,600
I take what's left in its barely enough
for me to live so works out if it didn't

911
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,080
I would negotiate with them saying that
look like we're all in this together

912
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,700
should we keep doing this

913
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,260
it's not working for me yes so people
come up with ideas including payments

914
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:41,300
compensation arm and I get final say
it's my vision is my company but I'm not

915
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,500
going to make any decision that other
people are dissatisfied with

916
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,000
thats 30 the decision-making process
that

917
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,950
I company which I call cornfield
electronics cuz they came up with the

918
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:56,910
name I lived in Urbana Illinois
surrounded by thousands of miles of corn

919
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:00,609
I interesting presentation thank you
very much for sharing your insights

920
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:05,290
I'm wondering you have projects you're
ready to go you believe in it yourself

921
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:09,250
but you're trying to get it up there to
the public the public's not responded so

922
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,180
much

923
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,390
what kinda spark to you think you need
in order to get it

924
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:18,120
really out there and get that fire
started well that there is

925
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,759
no one simple answer for that if it
still burning inside a view

926
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,190
arm just gotta keep trying different
ways I N

927
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:28,400
a friends and arm

928
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,520
colleagues fellow hackers are great
resources so

929
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,880
if something's burning inside to me I'm
enthusiastic about it I tell everyone

930
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,550
about it

931
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:42,980
and a if a ideas come my way I pick up
on them their opportunities

932
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,550
arm in if not then No even if its

933
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,570
the burning inside me I did what I could
maybe it's time to move on

934
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,700
these are your decisions ya gotta make
along the way I've certainly done

935
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,300
projects that

936
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,660
I had obstacle after obstacle after
obstacle and

937
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,480
does not happen and I had to to other
things with my time

938
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,210
so you know I can go that way to Oregon
just be something as far as supplements

939
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:06,610
the

940
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,920
as I'm doing other things so yeah so

941
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,180
no simple answer for all that but yeah
we receptor way that out continually

942
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,550
because what I love now is it necessary
when I love

943
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:23,330
leaders

944
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:30,330
so I guess that it so things through 10

945
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,040
and feel free to ask me questions that
plus the congress or any time in our

946
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,290
lives

947
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:37,540
home
