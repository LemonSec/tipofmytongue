1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,800
which all fuzzy from last night still
before

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,019
don't worry I doubt there it seems like
couple other quick announcement so I

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,260
wanted to make sure you guys

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,530
are 5 o'clock your love was there's
going to be the lightning talks this is

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,250
replacing

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,480
the cyber forensics talks also want to
mention

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,779
that amateur radio exams are going on
now down on the sixth floor

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,380
information about this is in the program
pretty cool stuff it's great to have the

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,939
opportunity if you wanna were

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,869
take a shot at the test haven't done a
search for so putting on my shows like

11
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:35,210
this there's a tremendous amount of
behind-the-scenes work

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,320
for somebody like me it's nice and
simple I walk up to the podium I talk to

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,899
sound goes out everything's

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,690
wonderfully easy guys like we'll hear
running sound make that possible

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,559
tremendous man stuff going on are behind
the scenes were folks there

16
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,250
can be seen and now John Huntington is
going to talk to us about what other

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,230
hacks ago on

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:01:00,230
to make sure that the show goes on and
thanks for a good enough

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,900
on the last day the conference here
intact for mister

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,740
yeah and I think that's an important
point is the amount of work for takes to

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,759
put these things on

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,990
to try any kind of show is just enormous
and people really

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,289
to do we have no idea how for if we do
our job correctly they

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,530
really have no idea how much work it is

25
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,310
story into the far corners from

26
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,310
yeah because the city can see the screen
so I'm

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,329
sorry i havent talk here in a given just
a quick overview

28
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,049
on who does one on a live show just
generally we use a few demand for this

29
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,290
%uh little bit overview the technologies
we use in the process by which they

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,759
getting

31
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,000
incorporate into shows I this is a fly I
teach

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,409
teaches in college so this should be a
four-year quick answers are not gonna

33
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:47,970
cover

34
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,658
all that we're gonna give you too so we
will review and then

35
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,790
but one thing i think is interesting
from the hacker perspective is

36
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,149
some other strategies we use to ensure
the show goes on I miss the old cliche

37
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,280
course the show must go on but the it is
important to us because the show was our

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
products were selling if we don't have
it

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,810
writer job so I'm a professor at a

40
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,920
scamper concoct city tech teach
entertainment technology our city to

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,510
pick you

42
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,640
piece to my book which the first lady
software

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,670
I'm member local wants the chance

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,209
here in which covers Manhattan and
Staten Island and actually Randall's

45
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:24,819
Island I'm

46
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,620
just discovered this all the islands
around your current location

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,709
jurisdiction so

48
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,410
I wrote a book on entertain me control
systems um

49
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,599
night I'm I was one of the people Road
the certification exam for

50
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,910
entertainment where traditions are few
that's a brand-new to go home in the

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,840
last few years

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,220
shows that our industries maturing which
is pretty exciting

53
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,629
and I'm than a little bit everything in
just about every aspect of life

54
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:51,079
performance an awesome work on feature
films TV production

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,629
been around time so I'm I can actually
see but whose

56
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:57,929
were gonna show before work acid allowed
to walk

57
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,110
oca I'm what areas sound happen this
raise your hand like sound

58
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,580
I'm the song goes reviews and skins
violating

59
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,530
scenery were you at the start you do you
already know this stuff

60
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,030
so I'm okay good so that gives me a
unique perspective on

61
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,470
whose here

62
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,409
so wanna start with some technological
trends and entertainment sorta what's

63
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,409
driving the market I'm

64
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,720
one thing is that I argue that the
future for our businesses braid that

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,190
things are going pretty well mean course
its recession

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,799
there's always things go down but the am
term trend is good for us because

67
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,900
storytelling is our business that's what
we do and storytelling can mean anything

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,580
from

69
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,690
a corporate event to the you know the
juggler at the Renaissance Fair to

70
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,030
Parker at Coney Island it's all part of
the same things

71
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,069
teller from parent or causes the show
business which I was like random

72
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,680
showbiz technology is gonna change us
example

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,870
that I use for this that people always
want to be in the same room the same

74
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,739
taxes this

75
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,280
is anybody in this room know what this
is is probably somebody here

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,830
it was there something I'm and if you
can see on the picture but thats

77
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,900
with 11 about 11,000 computers in a room

78
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,519
there there's absolutely and they're
playing games this was in Sweden I

79
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,000
believe

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,550
absolutely no reason to do this
technically right there's

81
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,180
cheesy %uh

82
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,100
you could just do this on the internet
there's no reason to have everybody in

83
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,790
the same room

84
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,169
so why did he do it the people like to
be with other people were socially so

85
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,948
know this technology I we was going to
displace live performances certainly

86
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,009
heard over the you know

87
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,990
100 years I fear is not as dominant as
it once was things like that but

88
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,770
live if you look at live entertainment I
would include this in my merit a min

89
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,969
%uh and across the risks marchers from
my retainer to sing bands playing things

90
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,500
like a

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,660
markets pretty good for us so I'm

92
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,250
and the course we've already survived
you know this is permitted

93
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,190
for spam entertainment we already
survived movies TV radio

94
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,979
the Internet's not really a big deal in
that context across this meeting itself

95
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:07,710
wide

96
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,109
why we meeting in person don't need to
could

97
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,870
everybody here could manage sir you know
some sort of the internet thing actually

98
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,400
this weekend there's a

99
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,690
magic conference on line for magicians

100
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,060
and they got a good response to be very
interesting to see I i

101
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,300
obviously been here all weekend the urge
to see how that worked out because I

102
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,389
mean to me

103
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,550
running into people always just as
important as coming to the tart so

104
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,789
thats and that's hard to do in your so
until they figure that out I think word

105
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:40,650
good safer live entertainment so I'm

106
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,139
the entertainer bars reasonable
competition now we have all these things

107
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,660
withdrawn about others and I'm gonna
read somebody's writer

108
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,330
I hate to be PowerPoint returns to know
there's some are you

109
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,889
reverses talks with non-life media
internet the maker movement course

110
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,110
there's all these other things out there
so the bar is raised some people go to

111
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,750
see a live show their expectations are
higher

112
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,060
I'm than they were and a course the
other

113
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,160
trend which is kinda combined with this
everything's we on the network in

114
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,610
an outline as well that's what my book
actually the

115
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,240
first edition other had I think maybe
fiber does in the mid 90's

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,650
and maybe five or ten pages on Ethernet
the kerner

117
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,419
tradition has like two or three chapters
so that's happened over that period

118
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,359
we've gone through when things very
critical for us in order to work quickly

119
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,979
isn't my little processes are in caps
we're not talking about that

120
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,020
course computing Party SPD is ever
cheaper

121
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,219
arm you can put lots of things over the
place eclectic

122
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,539
the net network than 130 diminish Inc

123
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,840
sorry intricacy of simple programming
has been removed and that's the only way

124
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,630
that we can do

125
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,080
we do not talk about that as you go
forward after right now

126
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,050
so we have to work very very quickly
under very very difficult constraints

127
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,349
so we need to to box things %um to make
them as simple as possible

128
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,940
to make it as reliable as possible also
be able to fix it quickly

129
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,240
that's really that's really critical for
us

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,479
arm it's crazy said right on the
packaging is a big part

131
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,020
so a lot of things are very high-tech
systems that we use in our field

132
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,639
will be packaged into something Micah
waiting consulates is probably one in

133
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,780
this year's

134
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,259
in the other room certainly 13 going
through user's computer

135
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,419
I'm to something like very complex thing

136
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:33,250
you know moving waves and things like
that we packaged into

137
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,900
be here of course be standard software
some running mixer

138
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,259
windows or something inside repackage
into a box with wanna buttons on it

139
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,270
that has some constraints to it so we
that means

140
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,849
if something goes wrong you can't be
well on another program is on vacation

141
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:49,719
this week and maybe

142
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,180
no means you need to be alert to a call
somebody who's already

143
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,490
use when these things you can answer the
question work at somebody from the

144
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,280
manufacturer

145
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,940
for some these things seem expensive and
to think about you're providing

146
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,949
24/7 support you buy a digital audio
console

147
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,180
you know 50,000 hours the hardware might
only be fired sick 7,000 hours

148
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,410
but they have to go instead to build it
engineered but they also have to provide

149
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,710
found somebody to go on the phone hey
you can get somebody on the phone at

150
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,930
three o'clock in the morning

151
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,930
wherever you are and that's important
because you don't know you know we do

152
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,780
shows all kinds appeared

153
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,370
times I was moving out near for Monica
three-car

154
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,789
Thursday Thursday I'm so

155
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:35,049
just briefly who does one on the show I
think a lot of people already know this

156
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,098
but

157
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,909
and I'm talk about the fear man because
that's the the one that's been around a

158
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,679
long ass and

159
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,420
man has officers standardize Department
and most other fans why I'm

160
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,219
entertainments

161
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,990
concerts or corporate meetings or

162
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,089
theme park performances you alright are
dried

163
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,959
where neither from the future tradition
14 another so

164
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,399
me those departments role there I'm also
in the industry we have sort of three

165
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,779
general sectors

166
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,279
the industry product development which
should be manufacturers so

167
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,300
are the mckarrick you think you'll see
in the second for

168
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,899
their traditional hardware hack it's in
the second for we have people who do

169
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,360
that at work for twenty years

170
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,589
it's interesting I'm but %uh

171
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,019
that's done at the manufacturer
typically and then again package into

172
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,190
unit that can be

173
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,250
sent out for show and their suppliers
and rental shop so you can either buy

174
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,380
this equipment

175
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,850
were rented for production so for this
again on the email list for the AV for

176
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,209
this conference for

177
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,589
there's been hundreds and hundreds the
mouse coordinating all the stuff

178
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,670
getting it from different shops who has
achieved this work we get it wears a

179
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,649
truck coming from some

180
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,980
so that's a whole other sector the
industry's people who supply the gear

181
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,450
rent it out and then the actual crews
that do the show so there's lots have

182
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,149
gray areas between all these are
manufacturer might also

183
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,810
rent their gear suppliers might also
provide show crews and so on but in

184
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,649
general

185
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,820
that's for the way it breaks out arm

186
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,269
and within that I am the basic process
we have is pre-production

187
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,899
so that's getting everything ready
designing and signing with the show is

188
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:12,230
and I'm

189
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,600
mostly talking here from mostly from a
technical perspective but also from the

190
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,160
overall process

191
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,360
so design preparation: beating
equipments are

192
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,540
and then rehearsal this is critical for
us in order to do the type to things

193
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,240
that people expect us to do today

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,120
the amount of technology we have we
didn't we almost make it look too good

195
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,850
many cases you'll see people say all why
can't I just change the way the right

196
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,250
now

197
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,329
immediately took us three weeks of
testing to get the Q&A put in an it's

198
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:41,570
all permitted as

199
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,420
we can do it but it takes time and
that's the more technology we put into

200
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,040
these things

201
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,279
the more time it takes a nap talk about
Cirque du Soleil why

202
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,120
in this talk because I would argued
there really sorta pinnacle

203
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,220
entertainment technology these days as
other specific areas are higher-tech

204
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,010
in terms of embracing an insider process
their proper certainly my opinion there

205
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,290
they're doing chairman better than most
other people

206
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,540
their shows take months and months and
months and months you

207
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,430
were hers and that Spurrier 32 process

208
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,760
but that's really important sauna anyway
so we have pre-production for her so now

209
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,689
we're loading we put the keirin

210
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,200
so for this conference is so there's
hundreds of emails for the

211
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,329
pre-production corny equipment

212
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,519
I there really is a rehearsal in this
case it will be there

213
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,550
him speakers mabel mercer talks for
example

214
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,110
then the equipment loaded into the venue
I think the ring here Thursday night

215
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,740
overnight putting in all the cured some
tremendous amount of work

216
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,880
corny technical rehearsals

217
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,950
this conference probably wouldn't be an
example that but if you're

218
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,320
same Broadway show you put the gear am
and then you have

219
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,329
rehearsals for some period time and
that's where the performers

220
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,620
integrate with the technologies
technologies their issues after the

221
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,700
first time that those are put together

222
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,079
then previews really important to be
able to do this together

223
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,019
whatever it is you're doing up in front
of the audience because this is the

224
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,389
server

225
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:10,100
placard what we do is that you never
really know how the audiences to receive

226
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,769
into you try

227
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,720
so that Ryanair process very very
important

228
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,209
in order to develop that created content
on the show that's really critical

229
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:24,880
and often you don't have reviews I was
attempting to show video here quick time

230
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,779
was a corporate

231
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,959
Tribeca Film Festival drive in which
i've done for

232
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,070
beers design a sound system for that we
now have a preview which is going to be

233
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,990
doing

234
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,290
we able to pull it off but no rehearsal
every year we screw something up so that

235
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,709
but the producers understand and accept
it as part of the process and it's not

236
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,480
worth it in that case for them

237
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,480
to you spend the time to actually
prefers the entire thing

238
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,089
opening night so we open the show to the
public this typically when

239
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,540
did designers and people like that

240
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,839
leave the show name leave it to the
operational crew again

241
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,529
this is it idealized model there's
always exceptions to this

242
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,779
and then the show closes so that our
process not over them

243
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,790
when it could be an hour later you can
just go in and doing it meeting in its

244
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,709
over an hour

245
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,950
might run for 10 years might be you know
sir Soleil show

246
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,529
car were family are for a were a theme
park attraction is designed to run

247
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:24,550
for many many years and then

248
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,500
critical part striking loadout have to
get all the gear out the venue these

249
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
guys I mention I think the schedules
tonight

250
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,510
to be getting on the some fortunately
goes out a lot faster then it goes in

251
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,689
custom pieces abuse made scenery and so
on be returned to the shop sir

252
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,810
offered to strike out because if you do
a custom set for something

253
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,970
it doesn't really work for anything else
specter's you seem to be online right

254
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,670
now

255
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,570
with a Broadway producer who is arguing
for

256
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,750
repertory parts in the Broadway theatre
so you can rectory part would be

257
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,550
you install you get a basic lighting
design you install if you to review with

258
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,810
their

259
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,810
really doesn't work for those type of
shows but from

260
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,449
he it's a good thing question ask for
financial respect because obviously

261
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:11,050
you can make the argument cheaper
reality probably wouldn't if you want

262
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,149
the same result to be just wanna be sick
thing

263
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,639
might be a okay but that's unusual most
things are

264
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,339
put him in taking out and for example
this conference they chose to

265
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,639
bring in their maybe because I'm sure
the hotel housing speakers in the

266
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,290
ceiling and so on

267
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,480
but it might not do it which you wanna
do an awesome mine abuse good as you can

268
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,130
worry remain a view to controlling the
way you want to this is why

269
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,130
often seems to not make sense why
everything's put him in taking out

270
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,930
battery

271
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,180
really does does make sense know the
rental equipment

272
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,899
if there is any was returned to the
shops in a check it back in so

273
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,720
the koster if you're running a video
projector something

274
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,370
the people my gotta keep me going much
money is but then he think up the cost

275
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,040
of providing a projector

276
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,329
it's unbelievable it's you have to by
that your number one

277
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,990
these things are cheap you have to
maintain its preparing

278
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,089
yet to deliver to the venue operating a
truck in New York City is not cheap most

279
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,449
my friends and I'm

280
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,050
the shops they don't make any they
charge an enormous amount for trucking

281
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,949
and they lose money

282
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:21,079
might be five hundred dollars for truck
running your attack you have to attract

283
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,149
a guy running it a parking ticket tolls

284
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:28,930
23 hours it is the get here then you get
back to Jersey or Queens wherever it is

285
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,649
here its cost money so

286
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,860
it's amazing any room shop constraints
his story true so it's a it's pretty

287
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,420
incredible

288
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,230
way that stuff works I'm so the
department organizational structure is

289
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,600
really key to us

290
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,350
arm this is the way that we are free we
break everything down in the

291
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,339
department's

292
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,190
arm it for again there's often times for
these are merged together inside

293
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,310
we have scenery who don't think she
referred conference League next we do

294
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,540
have some scenery

295
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,490
back here pain there would have to be
painted tracks would be

296
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,430
you know things that are handled by the
performers the prop department

297
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,279
handles all kinds of unusual things like
mopping up for

298
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,649
food then actors would even stayed
inside costumes of course

299
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,320
%uh that's a whole other us separate
department

300
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,529
mining sound video eccentric Center in
some figure shows mine have

301
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,750
additional specially like special fax
although Social Fixer really just the

302
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,000
things that don't flaunt other
department

303
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,279
departments reading for example a circus

304
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,370
things like that you might have a
special hearing Department show control

305
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,050
that sorted

306
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,730
wanna my specialties I am that you
really only find in a

307
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,089
big as a separate department we find it
all over the place but as a separate

308
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:44,690
department

309
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,860
we find it few Parker Waseca

310
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,380
communications if you're doing the
Grammy Awards whatever they're very will

311
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,550
be a separate department

312
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,630
just handles the the intercom system
because it's so massive and it's so

313
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,160
critical to the show

314
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,209
%uh their new need separate people to
handle it

315
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,720
so I'm just gonna go quickly through
some in these areas just to give you a

316
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,860
quick overview the process the process
is

317
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,059
more or less the same freak so the so go
faster to go through

318
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,990
but generally there someone who's
designing for example the searing the

319
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,599
pain

320
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,829
seen designer call theatrical production
there

321
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,879
that's a creative artist Omega trying
sketches in

322
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,400
often contract documents within a system
I'm

323
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,570
they send this creative package to the
scene shop for release or the engineers

324
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,200
they bid on this it's very hard to these
are things you never do

325
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,750
before C have to come up with the number
friends are on scene shops in a dynamo

326
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,620
how the

327
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,049
dawn answers unsteady ones that have
been successful business it's a pretty

328
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:47,510
amazing

329
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,160
the way they survive cuz really tough
business and even if you're

330
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,049
somebody who has 20 engineers on staff
to do really complex things

331
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,299
you're still competing against the guy
in a garage for the tables

332
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,950
so it's always always it's always rough
forcefully

333
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,679
for the mortar shops the shows are
getting are complicating the guy in

334
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,549
with the table saws not gonna be able to
build others showing the shop right now

335
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,990
called for for soliloquy the desert scum
based on a movie

336
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,260
for the entire bus is a video screen and
its II

337
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,080
County millions is worth but its working
on it for months already

338
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,149
I'm to the shop to build this equipment
um

339
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,480
I'm sorry that did the equipment the
contract is awarded by the producer the

340
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,970
general manager the people who control
the finances for the show

341
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,799
they base their factors might be you
know

342
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,918
me this countless company can do it I've
been working on this guy for twenty

343
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,200
years I know that I can get him on the
phone if there's a problem someone

344
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,270
that's actually worth a lot

345
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,309
and and all those factors very
complicated them

346
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,350
shop people build the scenery in the
produce is gonna in that series

347
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,390
typically unless its automation
equipment which is often peace to the

348
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,299
show

349
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,539
every again always it depends there's no

357
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,660
people

358
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,690
who my to do what some are two different
things and are very good at building

359
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,039
stuff

360
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,160

363
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,340
very very fast

364
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,699
ever watched actually the most
impressive props the mir things like on

365
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,910
The Daily Show

366
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,970
were letter minner those kinda shows
where is writers come up with something

367
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,240
at three o'clock for 2 o'clock and they
have to get something together

368
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,450
by 5:30 or 6 me tape that starts

369
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,470
he's going to work fast they don't plan
to step out

370
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,820
you're not gonna know that Dick Cheney

373
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,169
France's a prophet who does an I'm

same sorta process that again very casa
shots are very

375
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,720
need some very specialized employees

376
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,990
you know people that want to tiny tiny
be were or

377

know how to to cut things in 3d this

378
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,620
it's very hard to do Constance

the resign kasinga painter the reason
I'm to you with so

381
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,539
at get custom-made you have to fitness
to the performers

382
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,590
I'm sorry when should mention the the

383
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,490
casa shop again there's a shopping make
it with the specialist

384
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,679
Custom Shop people and the Wardrobe
typically called mister cities usually

385
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,809
women

386
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,270
most of the time weirder misuse the word
rube to read

387
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,010
Wong runnin the castles in the future

389
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,168
have you know and be able to fix things
quickly I used to work at the Metro

390
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,340
Africa and I was doing some for from
House event

391
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,549
I had to go get a tax talks I wouldn't
wear if I'd

392
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:18,639
didn't execute loading a truck leader
I'm

393
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,020
and I got a course talks and

394
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,850
disabled list I'm the

395
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,780
cookers you know madhouse region rings
for tax years because the course leads

396
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,178
where saigon

397
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,679
and about five minutes before or maybe
sorry about an hour before the party

398
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,370
started

399
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,600
every single but go after sure on this
so

400
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,059
I went to bring up to the wardrobe guy
and he actually stitch every single one

401
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,960
back on before had to go out

402
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,770
and hand the microphone to pop right
here so its

403
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,250
again high pressure stuff but you have
to do quickly

404
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,100
this is why the stuff is expensive you
need lots and lots of people around

405
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,270
could you not gonna you know it's not
working here we want to put buttons back

406
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,450
toxic its gonna

407
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,480
lighting again when it's gone from being
very very low-tech to very high tackle

408
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,409
sry its stuck in 10 ways I could spend
three hours talking about than you can

409
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:12,530
read mine

410
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,918
blog had a few I'm same idea wearing
designer U-mass structure sugar

411
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,250
production attrition

412
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,720
though prepping the that when things
will be different preppers much to the

413
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,250
gear

414
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,600
in the shop in advance as possible time
on site is expensive

415
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,820
even in this place with volunteer labor

416
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,760
they had to rent the whole town so you
know be really nice if you could just

417
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,710
rent a hotel for the whole week

418
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,150
you come and you work eight hour days in
its not worth it

419
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,100
so this thing know what time they got in
here but Thursday

420
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,630
what are your getting here Thursday in

421
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,980
10 tonight so yeah so that's

422
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,990
yeah you got in at three amber

423
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,620
am so and again so you wanna do as much
the prep work is you cannot say because

424
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,960
you wanna make everything goes smoothly
as possible

425
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,169
on-site also you have to be ready for
everything to go

426
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:06,940
began on-site so that's the other part
basically same structure

427
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,220
same time just popping together sound
and video you're not

428
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,370
to quit same departments but they were
very similar process

429
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,340
gather some designer were consulting
engineer that designs at

430
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,530
crew chief upon proper gear again as
much as possible

431
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,270
off-site if it's possible on the Cure

432
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,129
actually sediments is relating to the
gear is typically ran into the

433
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,080
production on a weekly basis if it's a
few actual production

434
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,870
Werner Ben pieces like this this meeting
has

435
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,929
you know your rented from Thursday into
probably

436
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:42,360
very early Monday morning and again are
free to maintain by

437
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,880
crew on site and then it sent back to
the city advantage

438
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,190
fighting in sound and video on things
like that is that it's built up at a

439
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,770
standardized components

440
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,389
these lights back your source for pars
and those probably source was up there

441
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,309
as well

442
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,399
really become the work or standard
instruments that could have been used on

443
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,850
another show on Wednesday

444
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,070
to be used in other shots hearing and so
on same thing with mixers and speakers

445
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,299
and so on so that's the only way we can
afford this really expensive stuff

446
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,779
in order to get the showdown scenery
though is bill

447
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,090
you know their you make a this backdrop
for example

448
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,379
whenever the next meeting is in here
whenever that is they may not want this

449
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,770
right so it's you're not gonna be around

450
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,360
%um hope for me be able to sell it to
somebody else so that's why syria

451
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,690
being custom be very expensive

452
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,370
good okay so the title a talk here they
caught hacking my merit a min and I

453
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,169
and I really do think that that's what
we do actually times acrimonious

454
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:43,299
I'm so our industry I am

455
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:47,418
we've grown a huge amount the last
couple decades side been in about 20

456
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,200
years 25 years

457
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,549
it's gone changed so much in a time it's
really exciting

458
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,000
still text tiny by standard most
industries site that would have been a

459
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,020
good wing

460
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,799
I'm the other night despair quick read
the entire concert industry

461
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,610
was about four billion dollar gross in
2008 that's a lotta money four billion

462
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,679
dollars

463
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,120
revenue Genn year 183 for 183 billion

464
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,620
so trying all concert production I can't
do math in my head but very tiny

465
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,470
fraction about

466
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,970
one major companies revenues so were
tiny

467
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,200
business in the in the big picture so
that means we can't afford wanna be sick

468
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,490
research

469
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,690
so and what does that mean if we can
develop things

470
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,029
specifically for business or exchanging
a little bit

471
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,169
what we have to do is hack other
people's technologies

472
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,390
one thing it's interesting is the basic
research thing is still very much true

473
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,650
but people are starting to

474
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,990
to recognize us as a testing ground if
you look in the other room there some

475
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,200
LED

476
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,309
fixtures on a grounder appointing those
cans in the ceiling

477
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,330
the LED manufactures are realizing that
hey you know

478
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,289
with what they wanna make for the home
market is really nice looking

479
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,400
wat late incandescent replacement

480
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,750
we weren't really weird colors and
things like this

481
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,120
very vivid reds and greens and blues in
San ambers in whatever

482
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,250
so they've said hey here's a market that
we can develop all this stuff so

483
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,830
little tiny market are company for our
business actually got fucked by Phillips

484
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,460
and obviously you know they can go make
some money for him but i mean again

485
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,590
its 1 percent of what their where me

486
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,130
residential land market will be so are
starting to realize and also on the

487
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,059
internet world

488
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:31,168
guide is in charge the paramount Power
over Ethernet

489
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,279
committee actually comes from our
business because we do really weird

490
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,450
things with Ethernet

491
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,169
and dragged through the mud through
elephant crap at the circus and things

492
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:40,750
like that so

493
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:46,580
%um typical office environment people
don't do that so

494
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,129
where you work I'm so we have two

495
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,450
also do all this while meeting these
challenges these constraints

496
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,760
has seven right now great directors
don't wanna see

497
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,049
to weed and time on stage is cost a lot
of money I work up the radio city

498
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:01,940
occasionally

499
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,110
and I can our work at the don't come
universe cuz I can remember but

500
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,390
that per hour up there is 1000 hours and
it's not that the guys are making

501
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,580
houses are they really make a good
living but they were gonna walk

502
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,789
there's lots of people work that's when
it that's why it's expensive and you're

503
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:17,289
in the middle

504
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:20,760
Manhattan it is big massive remix maybe

505
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,970
be used for you know to make money a few
nights out of the year

506
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,190
you know in the big picture compare to
hotel where you can

507
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,140
Council insurance we have to move now we
have great

508
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,289
also has to be reliable or at least
appear to be wrong

509
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,260
talking about that so you know the exam
party's use for this is if you go see a

510
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,960
Broadway show and the mike is coming out
all the time you're talking in its like

511
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,500
this

512
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,299
and people who want their money back but
we're using a radio transmitters tu

513
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:49,908
quiere

514
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:53,870
are but same thing that there's you
known same basic technology they're so

515
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,299
phone works uses

516
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,830
their cell phone crapped out all the
time an argument the same thing

517
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,129
when but you know but we're doing a show
so it has a certain

518
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,779
has to work in a and for good reason
your during the

519
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:10,190
during a period piece and you things

520
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,899
then microphones and see have those kind
of problems

521
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:17,490
show must go on again we don't we're not
doing brain surgery or something but

522
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,559
this shows our product that's what we
sell

523
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,779
so without the show we know our product
this is one thing

524
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:26,080
that we pound into the heads for
students is that you know now in this

525
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,480
bitch

526
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,830
the key to this is you have to show up
on time at the reliable

527
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,918
you can be the most amazing waiting

528
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,940
board programmer in the world but if
your group oversleep

529
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,370
routinely you're not going to work if
you're an asshole

530
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,720
you not gonna work it doesn't marry
gotta get people talk about them

531
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,390
I'm and again when we know you have to
get through the show Cirque actually I

532
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,940
pick up with the French term is but they
have a thing

533
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,940
when everything else breaks top concern
the jugglers

534
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,159
right saddam don't if you want your
money back to give your money back but

535
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,460
in don't don't give you show me another
that's that's what we saw a surprise

536
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,600
so how do we do that we to the highest
level systems integration we can

537
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,779
so up this II

538
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,419
I think my car tracking to queue is
really cool I think it's great

539
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:15,110
we I personally try to do as little as
possible about anything related to

540
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,730
entertainment project

541
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,960
from is a buncha reasons that number one
is time and number two is why

542
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,820
I it's great to learn about stuff how to
do it

543
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,939
I don't wanna you know if I'm I just put
any interactive

544
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,539
sound system in a guy's garden nantucket
I don't want any phone calls about that

545
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:36,539
would be wow I never I never you know
knew that

546
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,890
the century interact with with this that
way here

547
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,480
I that's another story I'm

548
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,539
the so we do systems integration we take
blacks have things and put them together

549
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,669
and there's a water reasons for that
speed of course is one

550
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:55,049
the other partners %uh the boundaries
between things aren't good

551
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:00,330
we I like because that means if if i
contested is working from here to here

552
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,520
not working here here I know that this
box is the problem

553
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,320
and if I am 10 minutes before the show I
need to be we'll fix it right now

554
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,020
i campi well you know won't get to it
tomorrow morning

555
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,879
doesn't work the other thing for us it's
about the end result

556
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,630
in a magic trick there's an effect and
there's a method is the effect is what

557
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,340
the audience season the method is

558
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,929
with magician is doing so we're like the
magicians

559
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:26,960
River were the method people backstage

560
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,070
with the audience eases the effect
sewers talking

561
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,500
I'm downstairs there's guide to the
really cool

562
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,870
live wire I think it's Martin Luther
King thing anybody see at them

563
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,010
truly cool people everything himself
which is great

564
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,700
I would never go to like that ever for
show affect us has been used by Blue Man

565
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,200
Group a lot

566
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,059
we have animation controllers that are
bill packaged up

567
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,270
that have friends for dinner that we
could build that probably cost 10 times

568
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,850
as much as his cross

569
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:02,590
but it number one I can do it very fast
I could build on a couple hours

570
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,230
I'm underestimating the complexity I'm
but also there's somebody did on the

571
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,669
phone

572
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:11,960
I can get also other people that use it
that those people who already made no

573
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,010
mistakes

574
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,669
and them for me so that's that's really
important in order to

575
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:22,049
to work for the show so boat when we can
find something that we can build from

576
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,899
technologies that we really understand
then we approve appropriate adaption

577
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:26,289
hack

578
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:29,620
we have two hacked items aren't giving a
good example them

579
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,080
of Americans were real product
eventually

580
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,129
in again the product the moment as
retake space taste

581
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,679
seizing takes place by manufactures and
the packages technology so that a few

582
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,409
times that's really important

583
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:45,899
I'm the people on site did you know

584
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:49,580
typically and people who like to build
electronic components are not from the

585
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,980
Thai people who wanna sit and run a
Broadway show for ten years

586
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,630
I'm not saying you don't wanna smarter
than the other anything like that but

587
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,320
they're just different mindsets

588
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,689
so you're not really gonna get somebody
you can do board level repair

589
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,360
often who wants to sit on the show
however again there's always accepts

590
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,690
these rules but certain

591
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,679
theory generally the people that do the
work on the show

592
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,860
are or could have a different skill set
so again is packaging is really

593
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,779
important these boundaries are really
important to what we do

594
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:22,090
so give on some examples of this them
sick

595
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,970
this is a going to lighting system and I
was 13 and

596
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:31,340
made my own flashcards something I don't
recommend

597
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,039
and I use black powder for a flashpoint
so again I don't

598
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,990
people now I was 39 mcdonnell small-town
America

599
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,840
both even worse than that as I actually
fired the flash cards for the 110 volts

600
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,519
with to bolt sticking up through piece
of wood

601
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,840
I'm still I'm I have all my fingers
everything but

602
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,120
yeah 9 recommended to do that the best
was actually when I misfired

603
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,870
30 once in India ban my brother's band
or something

604
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:04,220
but we're in the second for the
volunteer firehouse was okay

605
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,590
but so this is my backing I don't
recommend

606
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,720
I'm but here some night we have a thing
called the stagecraft mailing mailing

607
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,640
list

608
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,659
some you might be on its

609
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,360
often there's a very low signal-to-noise
ratio numbers but

610
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,470
there's a lot of good people on a strike
postal affairs and am getting the stock

611
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:21,850
on

612
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,630
misusing technology an ass refute
samples I got some good ones

613
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,789
stricter me crazy um so does

614
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,649
solar shower this meant for camping used
to provide running water for kitchen

615
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,309
sink so

616
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:38,779
that's a great idea it's a little
viewership hang it somehow but maybe you

617
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,360
can hang up on the scenery

618
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,690
you know you can also go on in you can
really play on the thing to the stage

619
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,769
but that's not can be worth it for an
effective runs five minutes

620
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:51,390
courses lots operational issues that
make sure it's for

621
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,029
enough pressure and some but you know
the singing go down and buy for

622
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:59,159
15-20 tarzan you know to get a plumber
out there to plant

623
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,230
copper pipe up to the stage would be you
know 100

624
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,789
are so this is a type mentality that we
have to stop

625
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:10,239
this is when I didn't know about bin
people use baby diaper wipes her

626
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,869
fit the actual make up their course are
the actual make up for years but they

627
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,220
probably said the same materials is this

628
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,260
this is a really important one %uh I
should have known as myself but

629
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,300
from chain motors that searching Voice
that's a

630
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,669
product from industry for extra points
thing

631
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:32,230
everything's back on I'm the the pic the
way I have the picture there

632
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,918
is the way they're really designed our
free as her cunt op

633
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,949
%uh the chain with the mechanism the
world

634
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:42,939
black thing there is the where the
excess chain goes

635
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,159
and the Hawks office you're using this
in our garage you hang this thing on

636
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,210
ceiling

637
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,550
you hook up the box where everyone a
lift and you looked it up

638
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,020
I'll in the seventies when when contrato
re-released

639
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,480
for started they need a with heavy
things in the air waiting trust the

640
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,290
speakers and so on

641
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,820
but it's really a pain in the ass to to
Hampton these things we Skype 100 pounds

642
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,970
we have two degree in the masses were
gone so

643
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,060
excusing arm so babe tried

644
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,070
RAM upside down axes and we actually put
the motor

645
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,560
down and the the chain with ok the

646
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,009
going to change up so I to do is pull
the chain up

647
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,430
a lot easier first manufacture this
pictures from CM which is a very big

648
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,069
manufacture these things they've all
your violating everyone teens or

649
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,450
now they are macomb actor Africa so this
is our

650
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,730
basic work force component that we

651
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,670
read meant that we sir found by misusing

652
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,180
originally so interesting Obama comes on

653
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,348
condoms the a.m. muse on my wireless
mic's because

654
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,670
performer sweat a lot dancers and so on

655
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,810
sweat and the you not salty sweat gets
into the electronics the mic

656
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,109
shorted out it's not good so the
cheapest thing is to buy some condoms

657
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:02,770
week preferably non lubricated condom

658
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:06,630
putting around the mike is also great to
send production assistance down to the

659
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,490
store to buy

660
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,300
case a comment names and streams

661
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,470
things with somebody 55-gallon drums for

662
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,930
of artifacts I don't want these in that
same system use on the back their reduce

663
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,220
you use it for put rice in here

664
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,230
get hot water and we get release carbon
dioxide for

665
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,940
now I'm this was the way it was done for
years and years these things always

666
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,720
rushed out the back to fall out on stage
the

667
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,900
company on New Jersey used to be a man

668
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,339
came up with a classic version in the
snows are used widely now

669
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:44,349
because they don't doesn't create over
time but again

670
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:47,480
something we found for another industry
some this is somebody

671
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,220
Steven Rea send in your pool noodles you
can buy them at the end

672
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,980
year very cheap and then use them for to
fake up morning and things like that

673
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,579
because it just look like morning

674
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,760
doesn't really have to be more expensive

675
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,280
there are times where you need it but im
in this case

676
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,400
not only do we you're not going to be a
close to a bit of our scenery has to be

677
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,800
moves we might be right with his past

678
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,420
R crumb gr for pyro this is used the
this person said it is easy assignment

679
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,490
Dragon which way we believe because I

680
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,950
did this myself in college if you get
enough power in the air

681
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,240
lining up to get a pretty good dust
explosion

682
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,630
and as cheap so I don't know when

683
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:34,470
and I think the MSDS on horribly talks
about combusting and burning inside

684
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,150
some issues for this is

685
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,609
I did right to go to college is working
for a special fact Scion

686
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,700
this is me how you like rain in
california and those are photo strokes

687
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,730
big

688
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,099
high-power forest roads that
photographers use

689
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:55,750
and we had hacked this thing together in
a system there's

690
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,260
we had two racks 'em 12 wasn't I'm

691
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,810
and by 2003 phase generator feebis chasm

692
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,930
unbelievable recharge so to do lightning
affects not the ball

693
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,970
but the flash in the waning we were
fired he's often sequence with total

694
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,270
secrecy pact

695
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,920
extra goodies and the next thing about
this now I did you get the

696
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,589
the flashing differ fast with you get a
little bit a movement flashers

697
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:23,130
going on course that would to beat
against the camera shutter

698
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,230
do weird things so this actually

699
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,890
I was up in a bucket even higher there's
a brush fire broke out underneath me

700
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,819
which is very exciting

701
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,079
it's always interesting stuff %uh this
is the same company

702
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,109
anybody recognize this location week we

703
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,859
had bought a military surplus 20001 see
on searchlight

704
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:46,009
so we actually use it to shoot up on the
world trade center

705
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,270
us actually I drove the U Haul truck
onto the positive the

706
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,900
World Trade Center twenty years ago
there's the same

707
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,609
way their big things taken off like some
weird

708
00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:00,759
helicopter in vietnam or something was
numbers on shoppers

709
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,210
I'm so you know again something as men
from military surplus from a searchlight

710
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,790
adapting and using it for our purposes
here

711
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,450
see check from third

712
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,300
picture Arctic okay so they can

713
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,930
talked a lot about the search strategies
how we use our stuff successfully

714
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,879
but it really is a the key thing key
factor in all this is the people you

715
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,700
have to have

716
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,510
you have to people question you need
good people to do the show

717
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,349
track when you treat 'em my friend had
some guy Rio city was just saying the

718
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:35,869
other day

719
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:39,339
bad catering was bad show and it's not
about

720
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:42,750
that oh we got crappy for his regular
job it just shows the approach to the

721
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,660
producers

722
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,799
to everything if they're going to scrimp
on the catering means they also

723
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,849
script on everything that's I can read
them 15

724
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,900
great I'm also generous a specialties
that's

725
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,589
what's really interesting about this you
really have to be able to do everything

726
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:58,828
in our program

727
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,829
and I teach in even if you we wanted to
sound the rest your life

728
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:05,040
still have tix eerie waiting in some
other areas because

729
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,200
you a you have to interact with those
people we have to get along with them

730
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,260
also be you don't know where what you
end up doing

731
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,880
I got outta cards are gonna do waiting
ended up doing sound show control

732
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,560
kinda weird video weird social facts
things like that you know

733
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,020
so be able to bounce around

734
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,470
Union different areas is important in
the film world it's interesting because

735
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,869
even the union is very specialized you

736
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:32,599
go in and you are set up in 52

737
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,960
her whatever union is as a focus poor
our camera system or whatever that's

738
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,680
what you do or gaffer grip

739
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,078
in the stagehands local New York turn
any job quest

exciting it's even that's so exciting to

746
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,589
do that I've done that for

747
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:19,750
more than 10 years for the people are
great

748
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,540
the you have that's the way to do it

have people who can load the truck and
talk to the CEO

trucks lets people can talk CEO

751
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,630
to search small subset they could do
both but that you need to do

752
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,859
I can carry on that job I was standing X
is Aaron me there with a microphone on

753
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:38,839
stage

754
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:42,140
at eight o'clock who's the director for
Monica and then

755
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,240
2mm loading the truck with the teamsters
so you

756
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,980
that to me that's cool but if you're if
you don't 130

757
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,420
or you wanna get 13 everything it clean
that's

758
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,430
that's not the place to go at viewer
into chaos

759
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,149
i'm talking a lot about that shocks we
just did we had Chinese orchestra in the

760
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,910
first act

761
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:06,049
and there for Monica second mass chaos a
change wasn't planned very well

762
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,060
everything the waited to hackers rain it
so I was really badly

763
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,920
planned I can see that recording today
stand by that

764
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,380
very badly planned and managed but for
us that's

765
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,760
you know me just gonna do it you still
have to get the show up so you have to

766
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,160
deal with that pressure

767
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,740
chaos and i'd actually enjoy work in
that situation especially when

768
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,060
testified did cars diecast

769
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,490
I'm deadlines a deadline you you gotta
get the show

770
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,609
you gotta do so it had something has to
work

771
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:39,759
if this is this is their the cardinal
sin being

772
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,079
wat and not getting shorties things that
we

773
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,720
trying ever do um

774
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,460
we work in teams as the only way we can
converse anus there's really no

775
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,410
on a show for a selfish backstage starr
somebody I'm the greatest

776
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:58,770
whenever you know in the room so what
you have to get along with people

777
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,390
you can run a van with them for 14 hours
or whatever it is we're beyond toward

778
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,230
for year

779
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,589
or be stuck in them with them in a room
for three days

780
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:09,770
things like that and also it's not about
us back status about

781
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,460
the person performer on stage so

782
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,290
if he do you need to have social skills
need to be able to deal with people

783
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:24,380
also understand into the wee how people
were camped group work things like

784
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,540
I'm the really cool part about that is
that everybody is the same goal

785
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,859
and working towards an opening night and
that's really exciting that's unusual

786
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:36,279
the older I get the more I realize how
that's kinda rear in other industries

787
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,650
I mean course you have personality
conflicts on

788
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,819
everybody still trying to get the show
and again I mentioned before we like

789
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:45,829
these Department boundaries because

790
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:50,130
we need the Kansas points accountability
and points to manage the communications

791
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,109
between departments it's really
important

792
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:56,420
also like technical boundaries I
mentioned before

793
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,160
but something like an Ethernet port is
great because gate you know we used to

794
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,910
use

795
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,690
you know serial and parallel own 12
contact closures minute left coming in

796
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,040
out some device

797
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,089
now it's just an Ethernet port that's
great because that means it gives us a

798
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:10,759
way to testing so

799
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,020
also Intertek design you like that stuff

800
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,869
so from my system design principles for
the way we were cuz I'm trying to go

801
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:23,829
through this pretty quick exit only a
few minutes for questions here again

802
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,369
absolute number one ensure safety have
to do that

803
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:31,480
get them a second show must go on and
these are importer

804
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,859
importance in my mind and this is Mary
directly on which after my book so

805
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:38,960
I have water information their futures
then

806
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,240
I'm summers always better strive for
organs

807
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,730
complexities inevitable convolutions non
be room for unanticipated changes

808
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,240
what's

809
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,690
ensure security this is a new one
actually for Oscars

810
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,310
cuz people like at this convention

811
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:04,210
so from pretty obvious but the old
cliche CT the waxing is really true

812
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,920
you have to think about this from the
beginning to the end it's not no show is

813
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,700
worth taking

814
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,150
risking your arm crushed or something

815
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,030
determines glickman running the truck
the other night to rock

816
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,530
morning thousand-pound rack speakers for
a run in the truck

817
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,339
nobody got hurt that's partly luck but
also partly people been doing this long

818
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:25,040
enough

819
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,270
but you know you don't stand there you
know so if you watched like 10 wiews

820
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:32,050
catch you don't stand in the same place
for that packs gonna fall onto the deck

821
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,260
if you're going the truck you don't see
anywhere near the speakers for that

822
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,619
reason some

823
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:39,780
experience counts rely on um

824
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,280
and I really have time to go through the
stuff but there's some safety principles

825
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,560
we know we have a lot to safety
standards are industry the fuse for

826
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,759
coming in now

827
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,880
but are some basic concepts like single
fair food safety

828
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,140
feel sick design emergency stop PureView
for safety in some

829
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,710
am going around time for but I have my
blog which will give you your own p.m.

830
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:02,930
there's video the pink concert from

831
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:07,328
was last week where it was a looks to me
total speculation is a procedural

832
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:08,290
failure

833
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:11,670
she didn't equip tender heart is
properly she goes like this: it's me

834
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,530
stack

835
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:17,220
and they went anyway and she got dragged
off the stage into a barricade

836
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,810
amazing a minute hereof YouTube you're
somebody right next to them a camera to

837
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,349
capture the entire thing which is great
for us

838
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:26,540
to figure out what happened so watch
that honors pre

839
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,470
you know forty she's OK but that kinda
stuff is

840
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:35,050
thats this is why I'm CT some food for
us not don't look to me again like a

841
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,599
procedural failure not

842
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,140
it's pretty rare that a motor goes crazy
starts pointing it doesn't happen very

843
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,730
often

844
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,109
your likely is there somebody got
completion vacancy

845
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:49,799
something like that happening again a
party that those humans always need to

846
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,849
be in the mood for anything to hurt
somebody

847
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:56,460
because we never wanna put the your life
in the hands of some

848
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,200
computer I am because on we certainly
use a computer to walk to help us with

849
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,490
this

850
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,790
at about the same people in factor
animation the defense the machine

851
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:09,599
we can't do that we can just build a
fence across the stage in same

852
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,819
don't come here

853
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:16,550
right track I'm its

854
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,470
affect enabling these are ways that we
do this that we in in a great computers

855
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,130
and humans into one system

856
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,500
%uh really interesting idea money when
the comes from theme parks

857
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,640
I am after your issues you have to
consider like ours is talking about

858
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,160
dead man switch very important comes
from we stole that from the train

859
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,190
industry

860
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,950
accuracy taking Pelham 123 the old
version they have a good explanation

861
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,520
nothing I'm show must go on

862
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,770
redundancy reliability so I'm gonna make
sure I get to this program

863
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:50,359
time I'm so this is really this way to
make sure we can get a show in

864
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:54,140
in these days is is not that expensive
to have another machine running a backup

865
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,098
somehow

866
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:58,990
really some sort of backup functionality
YouTube lighting consoles are expensive

867
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,420
we can get a little box for a few
hundred hours to run a few scenes were

868
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,440
quite seen

869
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,079
a basic waiting for the show house Leeds
you can have that ready so some

870
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,130
something goes wrong with the main

871
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:14,020
system you can switch to the back up
quickly always use copper is the review

872
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,040
wherever possible

873
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,259
use for you when you have to you no
choice something spinning and spinning

874
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,970
on stage whatever

875
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,150
for obvious reasons with that skim over
this casino

876
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,410
lets them but i wanna get to this I'm

877
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,569
have a backup plan very very important
for this train for disasters talking

878
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:32,009
about Cirque again

879
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,680
they have entire exercise with ok to sit
around and think everything goes wrong

880
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,618
and every week every month or whatever
the train for that they try an ounce

881
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:43,430
military does is so that way you know

882
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,569
all somebody just got hurt over here how
we get them out

883
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:51,069
you have to figure out we already know
doing like I used to do a lot of offense

884
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:51,700
with

885
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,480
you know it important person speaking on
a podium I would have another Mike under

886
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,490
the podium ready to go

887
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:01,460
just makes me gives me less stomach acid
right fit this something happen this

888
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,940
to very rare that this happens but some
here you go

889
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,380
beam done think about testin testin test

890
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,710
figured consul like this there's a PF
robust previous listen but you can

891
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,010
missus microphone

892
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,359
before it's turned on into the audience
listen to it

893
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:22,848
lighting Saint everything experience
important I like Greece reports a

894
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:26,089
concept from the mine came up with we're
working on a

895
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:29,770
paradigm speakers a way to get out a
good

896
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,329
a failure in a graceful way that's an
important concept

897
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:37,680
failure from would serve you embrace in
this in that's a hacker community in

898
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,169
which to embrace that entertaining as
well

899
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,270
but you have to do it earlier ferrier on
the stage is not really an option

900
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:47,750
we want to do that well in advance we
can fix the problem

901
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:52,640
great thanks fix the problem before in
visible to the audience

902
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,270
I'm simple is always better they're
kinda goes explain some

903
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:01,400
was gonna go through these cuz I'm give
time for questions

904
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,079
really important leave room for an
interest rate changes the one thing you

905
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,589
can guarantee is you have no idea what's
really gonna happen when you get to the

906
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:08,349
venue

907
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:11,960
when the show runs things go that's what
makes it interesting

908
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,339
audience members do weird things you
never know so you have to be ready for

909
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:17,450
them

910
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,470
think your so I'm I think that these
about five minutes for questions if

911
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,380
anybody has any

912
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,940
I can't see anything so

913
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:32,339
to

914
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:36,089
mmm arm you had mentioned that you were
using

915
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:39,339
coffee creamer for flavor packs in like
arm

916
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:43,630
would use cop Comoro for like sawdust
arm because it's more controlled easier

917
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,030
to attain or

918
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:48,240
hoster what's what's the factor in their

919
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,550
arm I think when we use did something I
got the key the real answer is you have

920
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,319
to test it

921
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:57,529
to try and see how it works that by
buildings

922
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,700
well again I'm can recommend that you do
that so yeah

923
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,380
you have to try and add women to worsen
you have to test and then

924
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,730
key is talk to your you can do anything
safe leaves have to talk

925
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,780
your finger think it through and then
work with the authorities so

926
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,980
when I would suggest something like that
it be to our experimentation

927
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,010
my own experiences with I was at the
something like Romero this is

928
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:20,059
and time ago but its it's much more
consistent

929
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:24,440
in terms of how surface area how small
it is

930
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,490
to Mikes on us is served by deafness is
something random

931
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:30,839
but the key is tested on a fact we

932
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:34,589
did that affect we we got the fire
marshal this is encountered at the

933
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:36,230
farmer's a collagen

934
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,780
we set the thing up fired it off and
then realize that we positions think

935
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,170
directly under the smoke detector

936
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,569
to the big crowd smokers up in
unfortunate going to start laughing

937
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,259
cause in a radio

938
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:53,630
and talk to disregard your but work with
those people that's the key

939
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,990
hi what advice would you have on

940
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,079
for maybe a student Ron

941
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,270

and training cuz I know in the
professional world you have

944
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,099
love the funding in arm you experienced
people

945
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:18,119
and high school setting you know if
people are just right now for the first

946
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:18,710
time

947

meaningless they mention I have a link
to it from my website

954
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,690

963
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:12,609
called

964
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:15,759
I'm gonna get the name wrong but it's
like a central technical skills

965
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,349
start reading their curriculum in

966
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:21,530
people with where you located

967
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,109
Northhampton mass IOM what's the

968
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:28,540
was a high-output up there with that
view is due in vermont

969
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,509
talk to them have them come into a
seminar there's not a whole lot maybe

970
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,900
some Reeboks into

971
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,329
can you talk for min about automation
control it sort of seems like

972
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:44,000
a lot to the big shops have their own
proprietary things and we keep hearing

973
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,660
that he Seans gonna change everything
and not seen anything

974
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:51,970
actually out there %ah dike just got the
one minute sign so

975
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,300
I'm I could talk about three hours about
that I'm

976
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,530
the I mention no your most automation
systems are proprietary that'll be

977
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:03,530
continue to be the case there's a really
and i jus should be next

978
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:07,849
into your me onto a whole session on it
when is a really amazing new protocol

979
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:08,890
conhece and

980
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:12,230
advance control network it's an open
standard

981
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,359
developed by Astor has an incredible
opportunities for hackers have been

982
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:18,220
trying to get the people

983
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:22,050
and there's an open source
implementation online it's going really

984
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:22,619
slow

985
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:26,480
unfortunately there's a lot of factors
that when it came out waiting market got

986
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,650
its first serious

987
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,760
offshore competition the bonfire that
the recession happen so

988
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,640
those people aren't putting a lot of
money into that stuff but it is slowly

989
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,890
but surely coming

990
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,078
ETC's spearheading this the biggest many
manufacture

991
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:42,710
they've got an enormous investment stuff
and they're not gonna die

992
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,619
think is probably less when but check on
my website I have a whole article on

993
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:47,180
