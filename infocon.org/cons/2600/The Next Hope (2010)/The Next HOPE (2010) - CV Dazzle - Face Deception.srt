1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,799
here I'm doing my presentation on CV
dazzle Onyxia website there for more

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,440
information on internet again

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:15,440
towards into the TOC so

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,010
its

5
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,970
its Kentucky things small

6
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,770
been good alright does try it again

7
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,770
sorry if she does oh

8
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,020
is a.m. fifth Epson North campfires from

9
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,160
face detection am a recent graduate from
my TP in New York University

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,560
before that he worked as a Flash
developer

11
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,990
men for money worked as an interactive
designer

12
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,140
may loom it left my work as a
photographer

13
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,930
I made less money phil an ounce shot
nightlife in some products

14
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,810
on Facebook if you wanna reach me at her
the wall banger

15
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,340
that's also the name for a drink in and
Twitter as

16
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,310
Mr and that's my email also have a small
company called age projects

17
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,560
and it's called each project cuz it's me

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,039
and I do you my art project from there
on some here today

19
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,319
this man of am here today shared

20
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,810
what I did for the last semester during
my Masters field

21
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,810
pieces at NYU and the project few dozen
CV is for computer vision

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,130
computer vision is a few ability to see
within a

23
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,380
imager video using using a computer

24
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,319
and with that you can do all sorts of
fun stuff like look at their expressions

25
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,260
you can even determine their age some
new software and the

26
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,609
death a party that comes from its kinda
campfires that was used during

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,640
one dazzle camouflage is kinda over
non-obvious

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,540
improbable solution to protecting these
were ships from

29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,209
attacks from submarines if you

30
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,720
maybe squint your eyes you can kind of
see there what's happening is

31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,620
the gestalt the ship is being broken up
and it's hard to determine

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,680
if the ship is going to the left for the
writer

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,290
sometimes the size of it and for the
idea

34
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,250
with CV dazzling the same kind of things
to

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,960
to break up the costar both original
1000 CV dazzle

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,170
is not going to completely conceal you

37
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,280
like traditional camouflage my because
that would be kinda improbable

38
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,060
you figure computers can at least give
the sec to you using

39
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,690
if not a regular imaging sensors firm

40
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,540
or could do motion detection on you so
completely confusing yourself

41
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,870
his little hard but what you can do is
this

42
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,870
CV dazzle and the idea here is fed you
are breaking up the cost of a face

43
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,790
and you're using an analog technique for
hair and makeup

44
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,640
another example it here

45
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,850
someone else interpreter for

46
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,930
magazine called this magazine not go
over those later

47
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,680
and what is working in them either I
figured as

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,390
this is my number targets a secret as
face i com

49
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,970
something you might have been in the
news lately it's a

50
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,100
automated face recognition system and
actions attacked

51
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,830
your face your friend's face as powerful

52
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,310
and it's a little creepy and Facebook
knows that

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,310
and I think Google knows that too
because both of them have on this great

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,330
technology

55
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,479
but it's a little difficult to roll it
out because people are

56
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,008
kinda creeped out about it be alive for
me to talk about today

57
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,530
for selected for a little history
photography and talk about deception

58
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,199
and why might a good for you face
detection

59
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,340
and recognition how they work with the
differences between those few things

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,690
and then how she does it works and how
it can be applied

61
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,860
from the results and and accepts

62
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,060
some the other things I do

63
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,229
in school in outside the school

64
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,580
as a project like this which hotel
operated arm and this is sent to

65
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,909
Copenhagen during the

66
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,420
CRP 15 climate change conference last
winner

67
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,710
and from people here in Union Square
were able to hit a device

68
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,870
and that arm was actually sent to
Copenhagen connected in real-time

69
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,180
here all the people in

70
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,200
Union Square hitting it has been an
active

71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,840
there so it's an experiment tell
activism

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,260
and later this year be working on a
larger version that

73
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:37,030
56 in Mexico City and another project
that I'm working on

74
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,160
the anti proxy clutch and the device
that protects your

75
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,880
identity from paparazzi photographers
and have fun using

76
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,040
LED's high brightness LED and emits a
blinding possibly you can do that

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,040
as a slave flash or more like a
flashlight and protect against video

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,150
now it's all visible light I R the IRS
an interesting solution but like cameras

79
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,960
actually have filters in the cut that
lead out

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,030
and this is a a preview for a look like

81
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,200
Oakley towards the end development

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,380
for the history of an history interest
because a safari photography

83
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,600
ever Test Tiger for an hour to the
foreign journalists

84
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,639
before that am cameras

85
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,810
ever since the men develop service we
capture devices

86
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,720
on whether its chemical using a played
really long process

87
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,410
or if it a little hidden camera in your
pants they're all doing the same

88
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,700
action for you which is documenting
something or capturing something

89
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,560
but ever since cameras were introduced
into society back in

90
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,510
about 1830 there's been a kind a complex
relationship

91
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,659
two cameras and assistance on talk
points out

92
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,750
in a book on photography

93
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,330
be released it was kinda has been
ongoing for tutorial and the person with

94
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,229
a camera

95
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,330
is one that has more power over the
person who doesn't have a camera

96
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,990
and what she says photograph people's to
violate them by seeing them as they

97
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,370
never seem self

98
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,090
or by having known to them they can
never have

99
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,530
in any other turns them into objects
modifies

100
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,930
there's a reason story in the New York
Times about this and need to create a

101
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,550
Mardi Gras Indians were photographer

102
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,000
come in snap up a lot of photos and not
give anything back

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,230
the reaction from the subjects was that
they felt

104
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,220
Rob by the photographers

105
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,660
there's a lotta different views who have
privacy some people think it for

106
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,600
luxury some people think that is a
necessity and a difference

107
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,710
difference between borders of countries
to

108
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,880
of course for US maybe doesn't value

109
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,550
as much as the country germany has been
the news recently for Google

110
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,990
using WiFi networks and they definitely
have a

111
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,540
a stronger view on privacy

112
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,580
strong reactions from using it and

113
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,909
the difference is if you someone takes
your photo here on the street they can

114
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,790
use that for

115
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,669
of on except commercial purposes

116
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,659
but in these countries rules are
different and you can't do that much for

117
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,740
public figure

118
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,290
which i think is actually a huge
difference between the cultures

119
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,419
after some countries like to protect the
citizens

120
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,990
and some countries like protect the
police if you're at

121
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,590
Sasha stock he talked about how it's
becoming

122
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,229
legal now to take photos of police on
the street which is

123
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:43,159
what's happening in russia to heard

124
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,290
yeah may be there for sign of things to
come

125
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,319
so know what happened the privacy since
cameras came out

126
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,699
in 1830 is right now will initially
because nobody has a camera

127
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:58,979
images can move very fast you skip ahead
a little bit

128
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,190
to 1883 and there's this guy Francisco
Elson

129
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,870
could be experimenting with cameras
extracting information on them

130
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,850
and his experiments overlay images on
top of each other

131
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,690
a composite process and then look at the
similarity between somebody had TB

132
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,670
and summer youth in and try to predict
whether you're gonna have to be

133
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,149
which is do these experiments i think is
intentions are okay

134
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,760
nineteen-thirties was a big time offer
because that's unlike introduced thirty

135
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,060
five-millimeter

136
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,330
and that was a game-changer men
photography is now portable

137
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,160
thirty five-millimeter film not nearly
as expensive as the other hand

138
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,310
so you take it anywhere and this led to
Street

139
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,720
style photography observation
photography

140
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,120
or in your face photography

141
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,660
as a famous image from henri Cartier
purse on French photographer

142
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,839
and what is really nice for this image
is the captures

143
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,850
not only the decisive moment as a call
that

144
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:06,290
but the lateness portable cameras
inability to snap up

145
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,550
nineteen sixties comes along and the
term paparazzis introduced by Federico

146
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,720
Fellini

147
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,850
the film on those computer animals
people are familiar with

148
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,450
on this stuff and that's really

149
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,089
shows in those traits for predatory
affect decisions on time was talking

150
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,690
about

151
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,700
even though the look at some cameras can
Pretoria

152
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,700
and there's a a feeling you get when you
walk in front of things like this for

153
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,830
you don't know what's happening

154
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,830
to all that footage you know who's
looking at how long is being stored

155
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,880
if your face is being captured if being
linked other things too

156
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,560
there's a is in effect

157
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,649
are studying psychology by and the guys
name

158
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,270
science in the nineteen sixties

159
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,189
and what he found out was that actually
is in effect

160
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,970
being washed survey people and the fact
is that

161
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,140
you're less likely to engage in new
behavior

162
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,990
take a risk doing something new you're
not comfortable with

163
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,940
however if you're doing something that
is Rd learned new master

164
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,589
and being watched at a stadium for
example athletes

165
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,740
many tend to perform better out the
problem is that

166
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,270
you know you on the street in public and
you're not always doing things that he

167
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,199
mastered for you end up

168
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,040
becoming subject to you this decreasing
your performance not

169
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,459
i think is may be measurable results
surrounds

170
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,830
living in a survey on society

171
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,940
i'm talking mess around societies London

172
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,250
is probably the most surreal City

173
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,490
may have about 500,000 security cameras

174
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,770
inside with a call they're still running
bring a few

175
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,079
and the number they have about five
million cameras

176
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,330
from cameras in in the UK

177
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,610
number households in the US that on at
least one digital camera

178
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,910
is about 78 percent 234

179
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,529
million people

180
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,430
and on Facebook they boast about two and
a half billion photos

181
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,709
are uploaded every single month for us a
lot of photos

182
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:30,080
and Facebook may have some privacy
restrictions on that

183
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,410
to protect them that flickers a little
more public and they have

184
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,640
as a last october before for billion
photos on their side

185
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,550
and what's great about all these photos
that anyone is doing research on

186
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,700
computer vision

187
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,649
can use all this information and develop
new after but the really rich resource

188
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:47,450
for them

189
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,209
and it's good in some ways but maybe

190
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,910
you know screening to you and the
software that are used in

191
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,910
what people are saying creepy wave

192
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,040
now I want talk a little bit about
deception his lease mention its value

193
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,760
outright parents who wrote a book on cam
flaws

194
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
chemically via so the deception has
always been some

195
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,890
critical for does arrival for humans and
non-humans like

196
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,080
and judging from its current victory
there's no end minutes late

197
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,680
i think is interesting because you don't
always think about deception is being a

198
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,330
a positive thing and I listen to a
podcast Saturday from WNYC

199
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,940
their local radio station and what they
said was that people who

200
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,589
by are smarter the brain is more active
in some

201
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:38,850
and that people who told the truth all
the time

202
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,850
expressed more depression so

203
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,560
the no's Goodman good to know about

204
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,610
another firm deception no solutions

205
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,850
and this is a friends Halloween costume
from last year

206
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,720
and that's that's actually painted on
her face and it is

207
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,839
my mind how hurry lurked I thought that
was a

208
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,990
interesting that deceived me but I
wondered what it would do to you

209
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,380
computer vision machines and how they
would interpret that and remember

210
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,240
looking on site some reported open CV

211
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,250
computer vision framework from C to Java

212
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,680
for anyone uses processing I could get
sick often see the library for that

213
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,070
and show that doesn't have to be a face
phone this way

214
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,769
this guy was deceiving senior

215
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,930
for those related to pointed inspiration

216
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,110
for this project the kind of full
machines but

217
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,399
not create an illusion for human so

218
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,959
as a mention open Phoebe briefly it's a
open first computer vision library

219
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,959
musher half-million people miss kronor

220
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,700
to in the computer vision kinda stuff
gonna 2 million downloads

221
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,839
if not just her face detection people
use robots

222
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,870
oren unmanned vehicles

223
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,470
navigation chemical Res all sorts of

224
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,620
but it's really popular because it's
free and it's pretty robust

225
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,040
so you see it a lot on mobile
applications article print iPhone

226
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,660
applications

227
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,290
as available time different programming
languages

228
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,329
and how many people know this guy but if
you're

229
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,620
face detection algorithm all you want to
say is that that for

230
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,320
face not now few now or anything out of

231
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,779
and if you had a face recognition
application for a few know that that's

232
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:32,480
for

233
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,019
travelogue I so there's a

234
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,529
large difference between those two face
detection is just isolating a face from

235
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,760
the background

236
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,130
and face detection is a former object
detection

237
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,700
you can do object detection and
everything from cars money

238
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,000
hammer any kind of object for face
detection

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,560
is available in all sorts of different
algorithms

240
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,450
and people been working on this problem
maybe twenty years now

241
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,820
and so the technology is really come
around as much or

242
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,649
which are enough to give really good
results and be integrated into all sorts

243
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:09,810
of different software

244
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,130
for commercial purposes I'm sorry this a
great example right here zahar cascade

245
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,189
this is kinda party for profile

246
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,040
that is fed into the object detector six
feet in a profile for anything

247
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,620
this is just an example for small
component in the profile look like

248
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,959
and if you're to visualize those atop
the face you can see

249
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,149
had to cover all these different regions
and what if

250
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,010
with a mean is that am in the %ah
Griffin it's looking at the way region

251
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:44,130
in the dark region subtracts the values
from the lake region

252
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,510
up the dark trees from by region that
make sense

253
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,939
and I look to see if Ed values benefit a
certain threshold

254
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,450
so if your look at some of the face for
this money through the eye region

255
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,970
should be darker in the region right
blows the cheek

256
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,269
they're pretty and these are the kind of

257
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,620
correlations in the pixels that the
algorithm is looking for

258
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,630
this is a sample over

259
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,819
20 or so view profiles have about

260
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,240
several thousand views so it's kind of
impossible to address each one

261
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,039
you can't go in there in design solution
for one

262
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,939
and another one and go through attack
love them

263
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,919
every lap and they all have different
values I'm so put together

264
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,480
a example but missed over footer

265
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,010
how open CV works ministering a scanning

266
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,260
sub window across the image and looking
for all those patterns

267
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,980
for all the differences between darken
regions

268
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,490
and we can notices that moves faster
over the

269
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,880
reasons for its planned with is not a
lot of

270
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,880
country Frank and as it gets closer to
the face from that if it slows down

271
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,970
may be a little hard fever there's tax
on the bottom other

272
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,350
rectangle and it says stage is going
through serious

273
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,709
stages and the profile

274
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,710
which has all these little definitions
for the rectangles

275
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,250
has about twenty two stages if it makes
it through all the stages

276
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,549
panel classified as a face and as a
dozen minute

277
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,040
moves on to keep scanning the image say
good thanks

278
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,760
well maybe you could block this by
blocking the first

279
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,049
rectangle doing something really traffic
the first rectangle

280
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:38,220
is to find so loosely that it's almost

281
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,320
anything qualifies and you can see most
reviews go up to at least

282
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,620
seven or eight in the stage number right
around facing large occurs at

283
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:53,360
22

284
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,690
and then you see that the rectangles are
deposited over the face

285
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,100
and in order for to confirm a face when
I need to do

286
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,179
is have enough for those rectangles
overlap each other

287
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,410
if you only get one classifies it as a
false positive

288
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,990
but if you get the default is 3 get
three overlapping rectangles now

289
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,710
qualifies

290
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,820
face districts well

291
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,299
so going about trying to find patterns
old work for this

292
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:24,080
i download all these images from fashion
sites from parties have been boxing in

293
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,530
London looking at how people are using
makeup

294
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,450
to decorate themselves and as a
disguised themselves also

295
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,049
but wondering water potential is for
makeup hatter's order

296
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,970
already out there including lotta by
decoration

297
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,990
Pacific Islands and masks and you can
see

298
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,270
was kinda crazy that there are a lot of
thing go back to

299
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,900
even these things a classified officials

300
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,340
and I saw this than I thought I was in
love travel from abuses in

301
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,970
things are looking good and gonna end up
looking like

302
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,200
sure which ones next but they're
everywhere actually

303
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,320
some in the youth promising and I use
those as a inspiration

304
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,500
for treating face detection

305
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,640
if recognition are different automated
face recognition

306
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,390
maker program mention the beginning
facebook.com use automated face

307
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,520
recognition

308
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,000
the first step in any automated system
face detection

309
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,530
tracking after that trestle I'm the face

310
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,799
and after that it does feature
extraction

311
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,860
many classifies it and then I'll give
identification

312
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,669
gonna go here is not to target face
recognition

313
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,260
which is much more complex but just take
away

314
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,400
50 texan and when you do that becoming
the

315
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,380
head office making a can't doesn't have
anything to you to extract features from

316
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,250
so that's one in the underlying
principles us even as it works

317
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,919
doesn't explicitly target face
recognition but it does that

318
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,289
by targeting face detection am

319
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:07,250
I guess the best way to summarize what
is doing is changing the contrast

320
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,270
and the spatial relationships between
key facial facial features

321
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,450
and let me make you facial features are
things like your nose eyes

322
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,860
things that everybody has on their face
and also have shadows in their defined

323
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,900
and the the ratio the size of

324
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,150
those are fairly similar so you can get
a really tight pixel correlation between

325
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,039
these objects on the face

326
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:32,179
am just to say that again

327
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,230
you've seen a lot of them are looking
for things around the eye region

328
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,890
nominee very many are on the outside
interface of them are kinda

329
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,990
in this region right here so one

330
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,929
way to go about this would be to take a
cascade and look for all over

331
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,990
the features on their we want it to be
lighter and darker must be dark turn a

332
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,700
light

333
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,539
you can just ignore special to get
something doesn't qualify now facing

334
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:01,000
and the maybe hammerschmidt on that but
ends up looking

335
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,429
very very rough pattern

336
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,380
like conservative generative artwork
from ten years ago

337
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,750
so I generally work very well and other
thing to point out is that

338
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,039
if it doesn't occur than people I can
wear in 30 failed

339
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,280
an example of that is this camouflage
pattern which is used in a

340
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,970
I am person go for and this was

341
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,320
actually an effective camouflage
functionally worked very well

342
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,360
but the it was called chocolate chip
camouflage

343
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,559
and the soldiers few word confident feel
military enough

344
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,299
so camouflage pattern was dropped and
then it was later reissued to Iraqi

345
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:41,480
soldiers

346
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,630
in 2003 know there's a guy

347
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,289
the mission before you talked about
affects

348
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:53,830
surrounds unmastered house increase your
likelihood to try new things

349
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,178
and this was an image that Joshua

350
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,320
so the other day and I thought this is a

351
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,590
expanding example love how to fail

352
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,418
awesome stuff so then going about

353
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:14,100
creating these patterns mom since we're
not doing the genitive thing now

354
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,150
the reverse generation those patterns on

355
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,200
the way I went about it was looking at
all these key facial features

356
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,240
testing each one independently and
looking at the resolve

357
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,380
and going through these classifying them
in order to determine which reasons

358
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,789
actually look at to alter with a
makeover hair

359
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:35,620
so you can see between the USV the ones
with a lotta green rectangles are being

360
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,640
ever really strong face signal and the
ones without

361
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,440
a lot of rectangles on the bottom row
you see one other way rectangle

362
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,570
for the I for the eyes of a dark if you
have a white rectangle

363
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,750
as the inverse of what's happening
mountain show up

364
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,740
so you can determine you can gain from
this one that away rectangle a further

365
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,830
left i'd my work many contests things
like this rediscover

366
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,370
I'm just to see what the hell's going on
here different parts to the face from

367
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,530
black and my reasons now of course for

368
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,120
large ones in work covering the entire
nose and face reason

369
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,840
me looks weird but just to show you a
little bit what's going on

370
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,260
now would block it for if you have
something to cover that much the

371
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,830
nose bridge area which I found to be a
sensitive area

372
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,178
is not effective if it's the only

373
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,620
place on the face that altered and is
trying

374
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,690
a bunch more these variations these are
old targeting

375
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,250
the basic key features and you can see
here again

376
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,419
s interesting here from on the upper
rates

377
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:44,140
we have a black rectangle going over the
face are not a fan

378
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,220
their sunglasses in by other car like

379
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,620
photo blockers as the black rectangle
because over your favorite ideas to

380
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,900
protect your identity pretty cool cheap
solution

381
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,059
but where you can see happening there is
that if it's all black

382
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,260
then its still counselors a face so you
had on a pair of

383
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,840
sunglasses left over from watching
Avatar

384
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,320
anymore the I'm an hour

385
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,200
basically what's going on here is that
if you take a face

386
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,750
any takers inverse the inverse is
everything

387
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,419
that would work for a pattern a black
face detection

388
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:27,890
everything that's carcass later in this
latest dark

389
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,340
and using the you know what I've learned
from

390
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,929
all those different examples and there
are a lot more memo shown

391
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:38,159
to from a brief example ametuer the
target

392
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,390
is key feature keep features in the face
and by doing it digitally first

393
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,900
the face and Andrew and tested each one
sequentially and you can see the number

394
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,549
green rectangles decreases echoes

395
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,039
across the road other way on the right
side

396
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,260
the dotted rectangles they represent
detections with their Foster Texans

397
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:04,080
my cuz missing early requires a few
overlapping and over to confirm

398
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,668
a true face detection

399
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:11,130
so using this pattern here her to the

400
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,340
hairstyles and makeup artist who created
the look on that

401
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,530
this is a model before to show

402
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,879
those are all over her face texan's that
are possible

403
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,289
by running after a face detection

404
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:29,650
and and stirrings applying

405
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,200
styling hair and after

406
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,929
so you prolly think that if in
impractical

407
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,740
makeup to wear out in public but this
one is designed

408
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,210
to wear to a party or something like
that not when you're robbing a bank

409
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,330
and some other is also this is the first
one we did to trial on a different

410
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,899
hairstyles

411
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,250
ash

412
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,700
and Xeon the bottom just got a little
bit to make up the hairs coming down or

413
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,120
the nose bridge area

414
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,730
is not working have a makeup began on
the top row

415
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,429
and it works increasingly better from
right side to the left side

416
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,039
your nose the hair is really far down in
the nose bridge area

417
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,080
from the key key features another thing
with the inverse thing

418
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,980
but if he hears the cheek feel i was
dark on the top

419
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,280
miss also changing the symmetry

420
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,149
for having the Petters reverse a little
bit sorry you know it's not a trial in

421
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,539
there

422
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:36,840
at this point what is needed and after
this is to you

423
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,039
take us learned here turn into programs
they can do a lot of this

424
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:44,210
automatically take your face and
generate a banner custom

425
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:49,360
your face and then it's a good series of
these photos multiple angles

426
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,340
multiple expressions trying to be
scientific

427
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,780
and I uploaded them to photo tagger
which is a this application on Facebook

428
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:05,780
and a random after their to see would
face would be detected

429
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:13,059
and it turned out it was never finding
you the faces using

430
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,668
cool and the next test was Picasa

431
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:23,770
which you ever use the prior know they
have face

432
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,029
recognition in there cass is made by
Google

433
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:31,960
Google as face recognition Apple has
face recognition in iPhoto

434
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,809
Facebook hazard yahoo has in Flickr to
the Packer has a

435
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,100
almost all the top after companies have
some version

436
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,220
face recognition but the problem is that
they're all slightly different everyone

437
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,169
has

438
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,440
what they think is our own advantage
over the market and doing something

439
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,100
better

440
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,200
fun was interesting here i think is that

441
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,720
as advanced as they are in comparison to
the open sea and open CV

442
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,000
are the village and detector nobody was
developed

443
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,360
and 2003 and now it's kinda have

444
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,830
that was the the turning point for fifty
action and I made it really possible for

445
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,918
anyone to do it

446
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,980
in real time competition power

447
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,120
another really robust face detection is
pat pat

448
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,650
you can also you can go to their side
check out a demo there a lot of really

449
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,850
cool demos

450
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:27,380
I make sure to post whose MSA you can
download them

451
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,760
like going to get you recon check your
aging expression

452
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,200
and stuff like that so this is against
pat pat which is one of the

453
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,080
the top face detection softwares
award-winning

454
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,840
years in a row it's a company that was
fun out of Carnegie Mellon

455
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,390
and in my testing it was most robust fun

456
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,279
in here you have the same example those
tested against open CV

457
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,360
and we can see here the green rectangles

458
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,720
are strong confidence yellow medium
confidence and blue

459
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,919
think there may be a favor but your
chances are that actually being a face

460
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,820
for very low so I would think that it
would declassify and that is a face

461
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,539
because word it also classifies wood
glue or things like

462
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:19,940
somebody's chest

463
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,799
so c The Devil's knot like some

464
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,900
cryptology tools actually I'm very much

465
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,890
embedded in fashion and NADPH when I
think Ive

466
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,909
makes it work is that it can hide under
the guise fashion

467
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:39,750
hair and makeup and you can get
something like this which I just noticed

468
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,590
on the cover of Elle magazine

469
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,159
we have hair that's asymmetrically

470
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,610
and brightness an air is coming down
over the nose bridge kinda thing

471
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,730
for that was undetectable in a PCV
method I was really interesting

472
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,740
have a contact there yet don't think

473
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,100
she interest in from here like I was
mentioning we really want to do is turn

474
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,350
this into you

475
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,950
project anyone can use the kid from a
good take

476
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,679
and create a pattern for their face male
or female

477
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,710
whether you want to use make a the

478
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,880
cool with that or if you want to use
hair or if you want to use glasses

479
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,100
the idea have using something as simple
as hair and makeup

480
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,140
that then designers to take that
information in turn into you

481
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,950
actual objects or fashion for

482
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,600
example someone's iPhone you could do
collar

483
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,789
kinda pops up a little bit and hides an
area here

484
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:39,629
and you combine a things I care our
classes

485
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,049
glasses aren't really crave another
obvious

486
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:47,320
solution because are incorporated so
many people have class

487
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,860
as part of these algorithms and nothing
is doing

488
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,640
modifications ban deserve breathe right
strips interface

489
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,179
a growing facial hair and coming in a
certain way

490
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,760
move on from a sign and other thing

491
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,860
is with that software then creating a
rating system where people can

492
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,289
compete against each other and see who
can develop a stronger look

493
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:16,240
the way they be rated is by the system

494
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,520
car spf CV the FTF

495
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,179
from sunscreen computer vision

496
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,980
goes from 0 to 50 50 being the best

497
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,610
and when I think I wanna do for you guys
for some the source code

498
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,929
if you are interested in checking it out
my website an extra

499
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:40,000
I two weeks or so downloaded was it is
in Java

500
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,159
some that's being ported to see and so
it was an actual script

501
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,090
and i was just a horrible idea so never
do again

502
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,970
and so now take any questions you have
on the go after the lecture room

503
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,970
for questions of the guys house EKF

504
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:11,529
have one here I am all the year facial
recognition systems already mostly using

505
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,880
something based on open sea view your to
using proprietary your

506
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,409
how's work exactly as there is a be from
matter just totally not

507
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:22,980
and I think some of them use a similar
detection process

508
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,090
it's the the village owns method

509
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,640
is RFM for checking the

510
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,279
areas in the face but what most favored
doing is similar

511
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,500
in that it's you know where that is
creating a profile

512
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,710
on the profiles are made using these
things called

513
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,210
a to boost folk do sir gentle boost

514
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,529
and thus it is a scam out around 2003

515
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:51,220
that's when things really took off and I
think from what I've read most people

516
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,260
are using

517
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,990
the candidate abuse technology that's
you think really knows profile still

518
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,600
and in a lot of commercial people are
doing that because we fear is this

519
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,529
was fairly effective in the test

520
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:08,719
yes what sounds like muscle this is
informed

521
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,990
by using a hard cascade because it it

522
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,849
operates on aggregates pixels correct
for light and dark

523
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:20,919
as competition gets better and you only
need optimization anymore maybe

524
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:24,799
in the far future might not how how will
the CV death will change

525
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:28,949
or adapt to that so on

526
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:33,828
know what I found and in a way that that
it worked out for developing news

527
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:37,440
patterns is that fair the best approach
is is

528
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,730
if you can get a copy a demo this
routine get anything

529
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,059
regularly see the result and you can do
the same test but I did for this new

530
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:46,799
contest all the areas

531
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:51,069
but I think with new algorithms are also
looking at things

532
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:54,129
more more fine-grained like the texture

533
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:59,009
have the faith and more fighting details
for these are really blah key features

534
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,349
are being defined

535
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:04,959
in the office EV and you have done some
test for the other ones have kind of

536
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:09,209
what I found is that when you and no
texture are a lot of little detail in

537
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,368
certain areas

538
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,029
when you get a better result so
basically if you can get a demo

539
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,349
arthur's copy online or something and
you can use

540
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:21,009
you can create is kinda plates the
context you to the other

541
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:24,670
on the tests run those and then get
feedback from them and develop

542
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,680
softener an

543
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,828
good talk arms got a question
anti-poverty clutch

544
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,319
yeah actually development as commercial
product yes no

545
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:39,359
awesome are i'm looking for to seeing
this and that together on some Rockstar

546
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,538
summer

547
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:45,359
acid

548
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,229
has a quick question jack about the hair
and makeup did you just aggregate these

549
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:50,930
features could

550
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,879
you know you're going for this very
destructive look maybe you into more

551
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,469
detail in your thesis

552
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:59,410
whether it's the hairline and the makeup
the makeup alone is more effective in

553
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,308
preventing

554
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:03,329
detection other face and it seems like
it much easier to prevent actual

555
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,680
recognition

556
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,549
whose face that so did you go into more
detail

557
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:12,089
later the project well if you can make
have

558
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:17,109
would be more effective if you are
running face recognition on the face

559
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:20,890
is changing a lot in this area just
define

560
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,269
just can read about my eyebrows in that
area the

561
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:27,369
the face detection is looking for the
larger area

562
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:31,729
looks for the shape ahead from look for
a border Matt

563
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:35,359
what I like about the hairs that it's
really convenient if you have

564
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,400
my hair and you can kind of thrown from
your face and threw it out

565
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,579
for a quick change makeup is

566
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,339
I may work better if you're going to a
party and wonderful send-up

567
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,578
some automated system whatever you're
doing

568
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,910
but it's not as quick as a change

569
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,009
that answer it seems like from

570
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:00,140
examples presented that the makeup was
more crucial thing because you're having

571
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,180
a very high contrast

572
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,890
did you also look at different face skin
tones hair colors

573
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,219
how effective those were and

574
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:12,729
how much contrast was helpful in
blocking the face detection versus

575
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:13,599
blocking

576
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,890
identification I am I tested

577
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,368
we are just with this model an we have

578
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,400
I only slight variation on the plane and
condition

579
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,839
yeah one really needs to happen to you
makers

580
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,979
much more serious project ethanol
different skin colors

581
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:36,019
is not so much the skin color that
bizarre algorithms are looking for

582
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:39,059
because they just change the image to
black and white but darker and lighter

583
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:40,440
skin

584
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,299
much comments

585
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:49,579
but in the dark skin if late make a to
change their

586
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:53,059
strangers

587
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:56,680
on the pic that example they showed the
last one

588
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,368
model top left-hand corner blue box

589
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:05,019
with more frames of reference do you
think that the software

590
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,019
could did have a higher accuracy

591
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,450
detection at 1 I'm working on

592
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,420
on either that you're working on with
with the style so you're working on

593
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,309
camp Irish but also of the softer being
able to

594
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:22,650
have more accuracy I am definitely I
think jack's

595
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:28,130
I mean there's could have more accuracy
very feeling it more images

596
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,910
what people are doing to not be detected
but you have the more points you have

597
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,129
the Marley family can submit to the
system's

598
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,269
and fine art and those tests are

599
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:42,969
and mr. tito better results you can get
back from a

600
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:47,589
and what I showed before was about
twenty different images

601
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:50,709
but it's more like running about a 100
to 200

602
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:54,098
different variations on that and you can
see

603
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:57,349
an example Monroe rate gradually
decreased

604
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:00,690
you can if you doing that process where

605
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,749
you like sharon is after

606
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:07,109
sorting algorithm binary tree they're
looking at

607
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:11,380
to take extreme you look in the middle
and if it doesn't work

608
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,219
and you go back closer more

609
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:21,930
more focus on certain areas

610
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,288
so these patterns in this

611
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:28,309
this typeof feature altercation

612
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:33,259
only really seems to be ap born a
certain type of social situation

613
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:36,940
at least right now unless its you know
kind of face recognition

614
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,969
come so pervasive that a blue-collar
guys willing to go to the Marlins game

615
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:44,989
discuss stuff space make it stop

616
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:48,239
yeah that's true but

617
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,569
did this is very adaptable for someone
like a rock star who wants to go to a

618
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:53,660
club and doesn't

619
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,729
you know in doesn't want be recognized
all over Facebook when people take

620
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,660
pictures of them I get

621
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,109
but the first thing I'm gonna do is
someone who

622
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,440
thinks in terms of internet social media
sites and

623
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,150
developing applications for them is
Spider through

624
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,380
Facebook on a regular basis which is
easy to do

625
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,789
pull out pictures and accept data that
matches for this geographic location

626
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:21,890
and match and figure out your open
source

627
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,828
pattern generation algorithm and match
to do that

628
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,849
and then just have a human look at that
go look there's be on set

629
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:35,759
so in a way this is creating just an
alternative way of flagging someone

630
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:40,299
on their I mean your you're not this is
really cool in need

631
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:44,788
like there there or this isn't really
going to

632
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:48,640
solve a lot of problems in reality is a

633
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,700
I mean for anyone I depends what kinda

634
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,880
problems you have I think miss Anna
anti-poverty thing

635
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,449
evaporated us only to a certain audience

636
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:04,039
and it's not widespread has not for
everybody

637
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,279
the yes celebrities and their images
being mined

638
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:12,140
other public figures in that's gonna
happen there even services

639
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,029
face I come as well celebrity finder
right rolls through

640
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:20,880
photos on Twitter I think an A matches
up to celebrity faces

641
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,140
there so many examples of those out
there becomes easier and easier to find

642
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,589
but it it in that the problem you're
trying to solve for here specifically

643
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:31,150
for celebrities are people like that

644
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:35,529
I mean it's is that the problem you're
trying to solve for is

645
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:38,660
now to what is the problem not going to
solve for your

646
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,709
if not celebrities this is for

647
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:47,038
I think a ever meet you number two goals
here's to create something

648
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,410
that not just have functional value the
functional value

649
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,569
I guess it's whoever wants to wear I
think

650
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:58,009
has had a designing it for I i've is

651
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:02,349
systems like facebooking going to a
party that's kinda

652
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,739
many ideas for it teach

653
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:12,739
just

654
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:17,390
could the comment about the Rockstar
come come in earlier as I wonder what

655
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,469
kiss looks like on the facial
recognition site but a

656
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:24,849
question was a have her daughter for civ

657
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:28,799
software that announces that analyzes
people's tired bodies in their posture

658
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,680
yes it the singer's the difference
between someone walking to their car in

659
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,058
a parking on someone assaulting someone
in a parking lot

660
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:37,789
prisoner playing basketball ur climbing
up Anna

661
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:41,769
as wonder if there's any Calif thoughts
on camouflage applied to

662
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,969
those are situations and

663
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:48,650
but some other really hard to do because

664
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,039
in those situations you have really
thermal

665
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,449
thermal signature and gate detection

666
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,599
having Josh mention that you can change
the way you are

667
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,930
bring different things in your shoes a
just don't know

668
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,118
what you're looking for but there's if
you're not aware a program called

669
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,299
HID human identification at a distance

670
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:13,819
which was rolled out shortly after 911

671
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:18,019
that looks at way people walk syndicate
and if I

672
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:21,729
to tears it up to 150 feet buzzer go

673
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:24,900
and I'm not sure where they are the
technology

674
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,969
but it's definitely since then developed

675
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:32,130
you have to give the texan motion
detection actually concealing yourself

676
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,449
from all these

677
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:36,699
is huge task I'm

678
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:40,549
whether you can make camouflage
promotion

679
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:44,249
I don't know mean that if be really
difficult thank

680
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:47,519
so yeah I thought the face detection was
probably

681
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:53,880
want to target with my budget

682
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,579
on I sort of had his first if you three
key questions about this in terms of

683
00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:01,809
um I was hoping maybe some other things
you tried but failed to know if you have

684
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:02,739
any other examples

685
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:08,219
you as also nursing a missus really high
contrast paint at the very least

686
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:12,239
do you try anything with do like how how
low you could step down the AM

687
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,670
unity a passive that black in order for
it to work also sorta wanderings is

688
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,079
still pretty symmetrical

689
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,079
hungry just to like half a face with
that with that still work

690
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,910
and Michael you know would you be able
to blackout 1/2 thanks again

691
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,589
yeah I think so it's all about trying
different things and some examples

692
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:32,119
and I found in that movie does looking
through party photos

693
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,019
%ah there's one in there was Lady Gaga
as Jesus Christ

694
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:39,999
and that image seem to work now is mine
members

695
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:45,650
asymmetrical Headley is coming down on
one side

696
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,749
the autograph question is the contrast
your high contrast

697
00:44:49,749 --> 00:44:53,609
works better if it's too similar to the
skin color

698
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,799
and if its color its red green or
something

699
00:44:56,799 --> 00:45:00,069
and when you change that black and white
there could be the same

700
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:03,690
total value skin so most for the

701
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:09,289
successful ones I found there all high
contrast

702
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,380
I just got a quick question the much
support

703
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,709
you've been talking about doing is with
Ghost Face Detection

704
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:20,440
and bar have you die so if actual
research on the side

705
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,079
on whether there's any less severe
modifications to

706
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,549
just fuck with enough that it can't

707
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:34,788
a directly identify or make you less
computationally identifiable

708
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:38,589
no added that it would still pick you up
as a fierce p.m.

709
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:41,969
pick up as a person but it would make it

710
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:45,579
more difficult so you don't identifying
a lot of attention

711
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:49,809
just enough make your face exactly so it
whenever someone is actually looking at

712
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:52,719
it and somebody so you had the pictures
have great photos

713
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,029
that a human operator looks about says
fees fees fees fees square square square

714
00:45:57,029 --> 00:46:00,999
over it there's a fees for those square
yeah and I mean it is

715
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:05,519
have you had a look if there's a and

716
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,549
less drastic makeup jobs or

717
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:11,690
hairstyles world still registers a
fierce

718
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,949
but not be as easily identifiable

719
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:19,449
I think definitely face recognition is
not quite as much or

720
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:22,969
yet as face detection and they rely ways
around it

721
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:26,170
and who was it HP or even over

722
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,099
had a face recognition system on a
laptop and I had to do to get in was

723
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:31,789
held up a picture

724
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,019
adverse inference webcam access to your
computer

725
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:38,309
and then of course there was the lovely
ask a favor dick recognize anyone who

726
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:39,170
was in white

727
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,170
yeah so it's kinda long

728
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:48,319
along with your face recognition but
that's where all the money is right now

729
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,038
so you you said you come from a
background love of photography

730
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:56,430
and like fashion arm when you frame your
research

731
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,788
in that context has a change the
perception of her research to like

732
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:03,109
hardcore CS people

733
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:06,339
yeah I'm not from computer science
background

734
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:10,779
and how the change will

735
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:13,819
I'm not sure how to present to a review
in CSI much her

736
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:20,589
presented see if what do you guys wanna
hear

737
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:25,630
I gave you may give you pretty pictures

738
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,589
well

739
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:33,839
i'm talking more more in the like the
dissection

740
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,019
love the face detection algorithm that
sounds like a lot of what you're doing

741
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:37,910
is

742
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,459
is more of a mom

743
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:45,558
a trial and error that states based very
specifically on

744
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:49,380
a certain subset of algorithms so

745
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,259
arm like what you heard among like CS
colleagues

746
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:56,739
about this like at NYU or elsewhere

747
00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:01,059
I'm I heard from creator open CV

748
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:04,269
gary Brown ski and he said

749
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:07,739
he founded funny Mike a joke

750
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:11,819
and he thought it was probably a waste
your time or something

751
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:15,808
but yeah and I think that preventing
this kind of thing

752
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:20,509
to people marva technology background
can be difficult because

753
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:24,650
I'm I wanna make this mired down in the
technology

754
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:29,749
it's more about the how you can work
with her I can have fun with it

755
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:34,359
and when I presented and in other terms
like

756
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:37,719
project all about privacy managers dozen

757
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:42,079
have as much appeal and the computer
science thing

758
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,609
an email me and I can I'm happy to talk
more

759
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:49,558
I think if it's a a Computer Science
Group N

760
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:56,559
I would change this from focus more

761
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,140
okay
