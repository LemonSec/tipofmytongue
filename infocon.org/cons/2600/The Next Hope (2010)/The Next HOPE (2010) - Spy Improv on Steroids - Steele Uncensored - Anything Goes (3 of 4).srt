1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,699
if the danger boy some small group like
a boss

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:07,879
which kind of goes to the whole world
wide I am so much more frightened of

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,910
them being under the control the White
House

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,379
I did yeah

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,619
that's an original thought so I

6
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:24,070
you just made america a reference to the
other long emergency

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,760
by consular yell so does a blog every
week that's

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,579
amazingly depressing I had just
wondering what your thoughts are I i'm

9
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,340
you go I'll

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,840
on and consular maybe because if I keep
reading him

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,160
all the stuff to kill myself now

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,390
don't do that on a super smart guy

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,370
I i would love to have the privilege of
knowing him personally on

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,600
what really troubles me I mean II was
educated in the 70s

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,289
and there were some very good work done
in the seventies the limits to growth

16
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,010
by the meadows and you're gonna renders
for people forget was one of the Coopers

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,350
he actually came and spoke you one perk
and

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,229
the Richard Fox did a lot of good stuff
Barnett

19
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:18,539
did the book on multinationals global
reach and what I find these days with

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,240
the authors that I'm reviewing

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,670
is that they're reinventing old
knowledge on

22
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,720
the people who were educated in the
nineties haven't read the books that

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,070
were written in the seventies

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,350
and wesat whose Jane Jacobs

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,509
what about Jane Jacobs

26
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,740
or Paul Goodman

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,329
community to us a we've really lost the
ability to do literature research in and

28
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,100
and the internet for all of its glorious
choice

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,670
has day

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,140
has really kind of change scholarship

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,759
I mean wikipedia has its pluses and its
minuses

32
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,899
you know I gave up on the open source
intelligence pages I just had too many

33
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:07,719
morons

34
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,569
trying to push an agenda a

35
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,739
but on the other hand some Wikipedia
pages are absolutely thing enjoy in

36
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:19,520
and nature to the comparison at
wikipedia: with

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,370
botanic encyclopedia Wikipedia want
that's pretty cool

38
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,980
because that's the power of collective
intelligence the problem is I i've

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,790
decided

40
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,959
that E Wikipedia would be better served
if

41
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,090
anyone can create but only masters can
destroy

42
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,260
because we've got too many morons with
editing privileges

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,950
and so that's holding Wikipedia back

44
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,879
arm and I have once again lost my chain

45
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,170
I am map it on your life say that

46
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,250
the question year the question is about
consular

47
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,959
and oh yeah well i'd you know okay I
love them and and and the point that I'm

48
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:56,530
making

49
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,150
the point that I started out to make
before I lost my mind are

50
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,879
is that we've known all this shit for
forty years

51
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,190
I mean there is no question and CIA did
some very good work in the 1970s on

52
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,329
eights and pandemics and infectious
diseases in water and the whole bit

53
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,010
and and it was against the CIA culture
to do that because it didn't

54
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,109
have any secrets you didn't have to
steal shit on aids

55
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,799
a in the white house and the congress
deliberately ignored a

56
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,569
I mean the Senate had hearings on peak
oil

57
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,810
from 1974 to 1979 and you know we went
through that gas guzzler

58
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,030
saying and that small cars were involved
in them fully staffed right back and

59
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,860
started pumping out big SUV

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,640
season we we lack integrity and the
finding a truck is a car into cars a

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,280
truck

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,420
arm so I think although the long
emergency is absolutely credible

63
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,569
I think that we

64
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,360
should not underestimate the genius of
the human mind

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,230
and we should not underestimate the
exponential capability the human mind

66
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,900
when it learns to talk to each other

67
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,599
on and I think we should not
underestimate the speed with which we

68
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,140
can learn from an applied by on the mic
pre

69
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,620
and and other principles of sustainable
design

70
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,800
on and it may even come that it's like
this massive global mean you know they

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,699
talk about the monkeys and one-sided the
earth learning how to wash knots and all

72
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,660
the sudden all monkeys everywhere

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,840
wash not you know I I take a lot of that
stuff seriously

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,460
I think there is a new a sphere on and I
think at some point

75
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,180
we might become collectively intelligent
right now it's just us

76
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,340
for at the eventually I think it a lil
spread

77
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,729
so I am NOT an optimist and in fact as I
was

78
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,000
inscribing the the new book for many
people II

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,889
most people I said and then I have high
hopes for

80
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,919
for our shared future on

81
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,090
if anything this is an opportunity in my

82
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,630
opinion I mean there's it's it's easy to
kill yourself but I like to say

83
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,940
you know that Daddy is or Alive daddy
without a job is better than a dead

84
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,820
daddy

85
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,490
and so on balance I think we should keep
every person alive that we can

86
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,130
go on sir

87
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,370
okay I'm what's your opinion on I'm
China and its relation with Google on

88
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,740
the entire things I mean

89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,449
cool obviously poor I was the one who
put out

90
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,440
they were financial reasons for that
help them make that this is

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
I won't save me if it led them to this
is about it

92
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,130
certainly had to give them some happy
hey it's a very interesting conflict

93
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,130
between two different worlds

94
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,949
I mean one other things china may not
realize is that Google can make China

95
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,090
disappear

96
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,120
on in cyberspace

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,410
and that's a lot of power

98
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,050
and that's power I don't want Google to
have

99
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,720
at the same time you have to are you
don't know this but

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,360
but I finish high school in Singapore

101
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,509
and Minister Mentor Lee Kwan Yew whose
English name is Harry

102
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,560
and who was once called the best
englishman Asia

103
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,669
by a visiting British

104
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:26,590
or or whatever on he has spoken about
demography not democracy

105
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,509
and 16 people now realizes just how
tough China is to manage

106
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,259
I mean it's got over 300 water stress
cities

107
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,330
and it's got some really big issues

108
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,020
on energy and and all kinds of things

109
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,729
and right now I think the last thing
that China needs is democracy

110
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,349
especially our kind of democracy or

111
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,520
and so I I vote for giving authoritarian

112
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,349
governments latitude particularly if
they're making sensible things I mean

113
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,340
china now has a stock market they just
did an eye peeled it is the largest in

114
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,410
the world

115
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,560
on on balance I have learned over time
to really respect the Chinese

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,710
I mean I don't know if it's true or not
but from what are the French Prime

117
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,160
Minister's was asked what

118
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,199
he thought about the outcome of the
French Revolution

119
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,229
you know ten to fifteen years ago he
said it's too soon to tell

120
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,610
%uh that's a very cool perspective and I
will point out that the Native Americans

121
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,270
like

122
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,770
to do with the call seven generations
think alright so I think we're at the

123
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,409
end of the first seven generations and
at the beginning of the second seven

124
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,720
generations

125
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,490
and on balance I'm optimistic on balance

126
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,460
I'm quite certain that Brazil China
Indonesia Iran Russia and Venezuela

127
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,919
are going to be major world players for
the next 30 years

128
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,378
and there is not a damn thing we can do
about their power

129
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:53,530
but we can do something about passing on
lessons that we

130
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,629
may have been unwilling to learn but
that we now

131
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:01,740
lost kinda articulate and communicate

132
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,169
you're tired have a warning out

133
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,830
%uh stay here until there's no one else
in the room

134
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,080
no one else is going to get off I I

135
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,340
we get to Skype

136
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,960
up you know I'd say why I came back at
my own expense from Guatemala from this

137
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,629
the UN does not know I'm here

138
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,909
actually they do I got permission from
my boss I told them in

139
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:37,380
and he said well steel what you can and
I didn't explain to him that it was a

140
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,450
like that I love

141
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,360
but you guys really charge me up

142
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,360
this is this is my play date Frank

143
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,260
oil

144
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,870
know I've been thinking about North
Korea in all these dysfunctional

145
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,060
and Corrupt Organizations and all those

146
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,300
thinking of practical way to soul that
kind of crazy

147
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,540
all through I was wondering how on
honest

148
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,000
person if would be possible

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,740
even if he has all the power they have
personal of the United States

150
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,920
even if Obama outlaws honest

151
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,849
if the whole all races and water would

152
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,870
listened with that actually affect that
honest person

153
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,080
in the government I of

154
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,190
our hosting imagining Lego a gang of
bikers you know

155
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,870
and the leader becoming weak the GAO
living in the killing him

156
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,120
so is actually came to me you know

157
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,170
freehoff doing whatever he wants

158
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,060
or he's actually a slave of his own
organization II

159
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,380
I find all that very provocative and I
don't know

160
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,260
so I can't really comment on North Korea
but one thing that I've observed with

161
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,050
great interest is the

162
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,670
the encroachment of cell phones into
north korea

163
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:11,500
home and one of our 24 25 members that
created the earth intelligence network

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,560
talked about how the cell phone has
reduced the resistance the on-resistance

165
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,420
stuff I don't understand

166
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,030
20 on and and frankly north korea

167
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:28,770
I you know I just just have to marvel at
the ATC the US government %uh

168
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,340
the the ideological imperatives that
cause us to leave so many troops as a

169
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,950
trip wire and South Korea

170
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,670
and to to basically try and punish North
Korea and Cuba

171
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,110
you know there too sustainable
agricultural models in the world

172
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,850
one is the a mission the others the
cuban I mean we force them

173
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,190
to not do bad shit by embark going all
that shit

174
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,630
all clever us a you know so I i think
that

175
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,930
this whole idea of surrender with kind
this is very powerful

176
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,300
on this book that I review which will be
released on

177
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,610
the last day of August talk about this
one man that would walk through Afghan

178
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,520
villages with the Red Book It

179
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,620
enhance stuff out and then in the
perfect language

180
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,870
whats ur I can read it

181
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:28,870
the Sun rises in 45 minutes

182
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:35,140
park

183
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,810
yes we do yes we do

184
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,690
perhaps I absolutely have to leave by 10

185
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,140
but the but I'm good sell that up

186
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,949
i mean you know it but the record i
think is four hours

187
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,030
a self anything over 400

188
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:02,280
we just passed a record eighth yeah
park's area

189
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,350
alright thanks I'm still going on

190
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,940
I so

191
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,410
a

192
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,010
all red bucket thank you thank you thank
you say the collective mind is good

193
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:24,310
a I need you a end and he would walk
into this one village

194
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,700
is very powerful book any work in this
one village

195
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,250
and this old guy would beat the other
side my ring about %uh they're trying to

196
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,740
convert to Christianity know this jazz
and sidewalk at the old guy

197
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,180
any hand them a copy the new
constitution Afghanistan in his language

198
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,990
and he explained it all met a few words
and he said for the rest today the guy

199
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,290
followed him around like he was the
messiah

200
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,130
K we suck at communicating

201
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,960
and I'm just shock

202
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,030
at the did childish stupid

203
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,650
wasteful crap we call public diplomacy

204
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,740
I and Human Terrain teams

205
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,110
cents IOC you know assists

206
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,270
its all we gotta do is still in the
truth innkeeper integrity in

207
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:17,060
and everybody wins we don't seem to
figure that out

208
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,630
this yr on my question was more

209
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,500
about if hourly there's are actually

210
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,020
power the they actually have the power
alright lemme

211
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,540
yes let me let me come back to that I
don't think many people know

212
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,880
but khrushchev and kennedy had a back
channel during the cuban missile crisis:

213
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,560
and both of them were having trouble
with their generals

214
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,570
who wanted to nuke each other and the
real heroes of the cuban military crisis

215
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,630
was the soviet submarine commander
refused a direct order to fire a torpedo

216
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,030
a US Navy ship

217
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:56,079
okay and Amin I i think history is
absolutely phenomenal

218
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,880
a John Lewis Gaddis has written a book
called the landscape history

219
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,270
and the whole bottom line is that book
in the CIA people hate my review of it

220
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,060
are is that history is it tonight area
for us because we've chosen to be a

221
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,550
current

222
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,680
history we've particularly chosen to be
a part of history written in other

223
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,480
languages

224
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,820
I mean this is the most naive clueless
society I've ever seen

225
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,070
someone in South Africa on the street
knows more American history that we know

226
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,510
about

227
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,200
any country in Africa period something
wrong with that

228
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,250
so I think the leaders have more power
than they believe and I think they're

229
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,240
also more timid than they need to be

230
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,430
I could save Obama's ass from this point
forward

231
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,250
but I can't get tool yes sir

232
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,510
being an optimist I I like focusing on
folks who are doing it well

233
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,580
time now really take much news in but I
do hear something

234
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,710
about the World Peace Index done the
sheer

235
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,570
about the land and I'm curious if you
have any insights into

236
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,980
certain things that they've done being
marked as the number one

237
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,680
was there an island that kill simone's
on arrival

238
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,950
I mean and I'm sorry that's really

239
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,040
to flip up well i i but they are
Thailand

240
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,069
and the man love the shape in the shape
love the man and

241
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,840
they really a actually they're having
big they're they're having big crime

242
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,460
issues

243
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,330
up because the Samoans are are
experimenting with being gangs

244
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,100
on and that's a problem because some
owns a really big in really bad

245
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,920
says the World Peace Index is the crock
of shit no no no I think the World Peace

246
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,240
Index is very good

247
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,860
its its it's one side of it but if you
really want to do a World Peace Index

248
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,040
try addressing all the battered women

249
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,540
try dressing all the people in the
United States who live behind

250
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,650
grills who are prisoners in their own
home

251
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:59,430
on the bottom line is and I am not built
for five strategic analytic models in my

252
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,190
lifetime

253
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,650
are it's a good piece index it's
certainly worth it

254
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,810
but it isn't anywhere near the whole
picture now it certainly helps at New

255
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,380
Zealand is an island

256
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,910
really far from everything on and one
other cool things to look at

257
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,140
is is the world in the Buckminster
Fuller sphere

258
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,550
the fuller projection I think it's
called

259
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,170
it's on my website I love because what
you see

260
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,660
is that the entire South American and
African

261
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,510
landmasses red zone really screwed up
places

262
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,720
and the only two green place is actually
the green places in North Park at

263
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,170
Iceland is the next boom town

264
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,400
600,000 people there and they are going
to mine the gold

265
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,940
global warming all what's at

266
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,400
no not really but they also just
declared independence from Denmark in

267
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,920
Denmark let him do it

268
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,940
on and so I think we're going to have a
Northwest Passage

269
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,190
and we're going to see some real
interesting stuff in a fire in the

270
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,209
northwest

271
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,040
territory and Yukon I'd be telling
Canada fuck off real soon

272
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,020
on because that's going to be a lot of
fun

273
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,199
on and then down on the south

274
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,160
Australia is actually poised to become
the harbour southern sphere

275
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,370
the real southern sphere how so well New
Zealand Australia and the antarctic

276
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,940
on and and this just some really
fascinating stuff happening and then

277
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,220
this red crescent

278
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,760
from where I said is desperately in need
of a Marshall Plan

279
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,100
and our problem is that we've been too
busy concentrating wealth

280
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,290
and and concentrating wealth very badly
I mean America

281
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,860
has is the top one percent

282
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,530
you know I mean RR wages are now back to
pre nineteen sixties levels

283
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,928
we've lost all the ground we've gained
in the last 50 years

284
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,040
labor unions are dead we spent 30 years
exporting jobs

285
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,490
we've killed the the the blue-collar
class we've killed

286
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,170
half of the white collar class all

287
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,880
so the Peace Index is useful but the
strategic analytic model is more useful

288
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,210
on because I don't want I don't get lost
in the Peace Index I guess what I was

289
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,350
would run into it was some the notes

290
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,300
New Zealand's disarmament which sounds
like that polish at

291
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,139
do you know anyone else who is leading
disarmament other

292
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,490
military regimes in just the power Apple
well Costa Rica

293
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,150
on sing a forest doing very well with
that small military they're emphasizing

294
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,160
naval interdiction and command control
and intelligence

295
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
rumor has it that Apple poindexter is
hiding their

296
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,400
on and the Total Information Awareness
was exported the Singapore

297
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,670
that's also were all the american
scientist go to do cloning and all that

298
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,460
other stuff

299
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,320
Singapore actually recruits them from
here all

300
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,730
how are those movements initiate because
I i do envision that for ourselves here

301
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,950
I do envision well I mean you save:
peace is the way that they also talk

302
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,450
about

303
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,270
keeping military I don't see changed
microphones

304
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,679
okay I i love you and I'm not being
disrespectful and you come back as many

305
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,200
times as you want okay

306
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,450
%uh but I think this is like five up but
anyway

307
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,770
%uh this a very clever I'm not the only
one that I i mean if

308
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,080
succumb daughter I'm I'm with you and
frankly

309
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,370
I mean you were in the a for today a

310
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,810
and and thank you arm Costa Rica has
done very well but see what are the

311
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,659
problems one other problems we're having
is it that can backfire

312
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,330
because we have spent the last 20 years
leading the Colombian and Mexican gangs

313
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,000
build-up

314
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,790
multi-billion dollar war chess one of
the things we found a guatemalan was we

315
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,920
couldn't hire any local police her first
because they all work for the

316
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,570
druggie okay and we couldn't hire any
technical security measures people

317
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,750
because they all worked for the druggie

318
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,990
okay so we had to import people

319
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,890
on and so what are the problems you have

320
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,640
is when mexico has a success

321
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,390
Guatemala and Costa Rica have a problem
right now although all the drug

322
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,409
processing labs have been moved up to
make it out we're

323
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:23,840
and the Guatemala put on is now on our
coast a

324
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,270
on and the whole thing goes bad fast
because it used to be that the oligarchs

325
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,908
would renter landing strips

326
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:34,990
in their big thinkers for twenty
thousand dollars and then

327
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,810
the drug he started insisting on paying
half in cash and half in drugs

328
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,200
and so the whole thing went downhill
from there in so now there's an internal

329
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,380
market for drugs

330
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,570
in guatemalan elsewhere on

331
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,480
and the police got corrupted and there's
no military the military got demobilized

332
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,560
became a private security industry which
essentially is

333
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,870
is the hidden powers these are the
people that kill you if they're angry

334
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:07,870
on is one of those things I can go pee
faster

335
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:15,330
I guess not were

336
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:22,330
what's your fuckin problem year's run on
electricity or something

337
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,030

your fucking point

338
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:37,030
say what's your point

339
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,960

service but go ahead cocoa with the mic

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,170
air you lose a certain amount of synergy
and I i

374
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,760
all the late notice we don't have the
europeans here this year up

375
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,160
Rob Congress doesn't seem to be around
well he's probably committed suicide

376
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,490
after the Dutch fucked up the soccer
final

377
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:05,710

379
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,510
Guatemala

380
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,010
a the Spanish one that fair and square
the Dutch just cheated themselves out of

381
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,700
a victory

382
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,540
a yeah and and really attic choked on
two goals to

383
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,659
absolutely actually that was a feature

384
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,450
I alright so another question

385
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,980
yeah I'm I'm just taking a general look
around here but back when I used to be

386
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,840
like a little Spurrier we

387
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,360
we had some issues with to a place
called cuber

388
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,070
and there's little nuclear issues will
be a big issues

389
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,169
on many many years ago on

390
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,800
US as far as I know is still one of the
few countries perhaps the only

391
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,940
that still holds a grudge on that
respect

392
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,090
on you for whatever reason

393
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,370
but but how can the US possibly have our

394
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,660
a high influence on a country like that
are

395
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,050
when everybody else including you know
you know my Canadian friends can

396
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,460
nonchalantly or their vacation have
agreed exchange in a great time in a

397
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,310
and come over welcome back to the
fifties hey the 0

398

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,490
is really been good I mean this is the
it too

403
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,100
four years ago I loved it that we had
hackers carrying babies

404
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,160
and we had little hackers and it was
just kinda me

405
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,570
but this year it's like normal people
have shown up and and it's been really

406
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,000
remarkable and I know

407
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,900
a third homer fits but %uh you know at
least they're smart enough now to send

408
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,650
young good looking babes instead of the
guys with with I swear to god this is a

409
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,110
true story from 1994

1996 to Air Force security guys shaped
heads white t-shirt shorts and I do not

411
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,830
make this up black or France shoes

412
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,460
walking in lockstep this was Air Force
undercover

413
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,270
your I

414
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,639
if you're on

415
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,340
yet will come a flashback about five
minutes here

416
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:28,910
yet cuba right QSR Egham me at my age
flashback server

417
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,000
good as it gets so the bases is arm

418
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,360
you don't you're dizzy US has got a
little bar go against the Q

419
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,790
here but but nobody else really done
much worse in NC the FBI was threatening

420
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,450
people who had charts of Q but just in
case a hurricane blood on the shore

421
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:50,490
the US government was confiscating boats
and airplanes it had charts with cuba

422
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,090
okay

423
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,170
it's like bill clinton is blow job
because we could

424
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:03,840
I'm serious one time was because they're
letting this get away with it

425
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,730
I will give them back on time on a
heartbeat

426
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,740
not even for money we have so much to
make up for on you know the the fastest

427
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,380
way to kill communism

428
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,010
in cuba is to is the left the Miami

429
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,040
market go back there

430
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,580
you know what

431
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,129
a I'll tell you what there are some
really priceless cars down there

432
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,220
I mean I have a 1964 MGB which is the
last car

433
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,540
I could understand which my wife calls
the god damn little red car

434
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,020
of but it's worth every penny the twenty
thousand dollars

435
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,270
a that I've put into it and Dom

436
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,730
now cuba you know me cuba for

437
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,740
I mean casters fucked up in a lot of
ways on

438
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,560
in the cuban people have suffered
greatly but is it worth holding a grudge

439
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:03,010
against someone else we don't have a
bright what we have is an ideological

440
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,120
cattle prod upper ass okay I mean really

441
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,920
which is still but I Q %uh they've got
some %uh the best health care in the in

442
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,190
the world they've really done some
enormous developments I mean

443
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,470
I anticipate the day when we're training
nurse practitioners

444
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,480
who go around it teams you know like
their ten of 'em equals one doctor

445
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,810
only each of them is really really good
in one area

446
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,490
and they do surgery and we're doing tell
a surgery and the whole bit

447
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,700
me we haven't even scratched the surface
some what we can do

448
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,020
so bottom line on cuba for me is get
over it

449
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,200
but we've got elected government with
the brain first

450
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,600
and that's really hard there are too
many things that are controlled by the

451
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,120
multinational corporations and the banks

452
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,250
and kiss sugar subsidies is one of them

453
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,360
you know it's it's it's just a real mess
and so I guess my bottom line is let the

454
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,600
truth come out

455
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,860
and eventually little percolate but
you're absolutely right we should not be

456
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,140
embargo on cuba

457
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,650
we should not be pissing off a good
service we should be sucking up to him

458
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,300
and using his money to make

459
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,780
a good things %uh happen in Latin
America

460
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,590
so so when castro folly case about you
for perhaps you're the second or third

461
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,820
time's you thought that if so

462
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,389
on be will would you envision what
happened was on the

463
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,780
eventually lights which will go on and
I'll say hey guess what we have a new

464
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,420
person in power me read in court

465
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,670
them and Ben well and we we were all
very worried when I was in CIA we

466
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,240
consider

467
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,290
role castro a raving lunatic

468
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,440
lunatic with the Melaka mania prague
however that works pronounce yes thank

469
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,250
you

470
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,030
up but I think he's become kinder and
gentler in his old age

471
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,040
on they're starting to release political
prisoners they're starting to make every

472
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,850
possible move to make things better with
us

473
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:58,200
and we're not responding on I mean I
personally I'm stunt

474
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,430
that the US State Department

475
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:06,560
and the White House is is continuing to
be stupid about dictators worldwide

476
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,889
its call Miami are well you know I
actually

477
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,800
you you make a very good point there
there are some cuban exiles

478
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,910
need to have the Reeses revoked actually
I think there a lotta citizens who need

479
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,570
to have their citizenship revoked

480
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,830
we have just clone and and one of the
problems we've done as I mean it's like

481
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,030
a repeated the Nazi

482
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,080
from we let all the not cases in

483
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,800
and then they form a little mafia they
make a little money and they buy their

484
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,080
congressmen

485
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,240
you know and I am in one other problems
islamic 7 the United States is there

486
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,460
like forty three Jewish congressmen and
one must look

487
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,900
you know they haven't figured out that
giving to bin Laden does not give them

488
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,000
as much as giving the congress

489
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,820
and and so when they do figure it out
we'll have more Muslims in Congress

490
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,100
tell II I love cuba's got beautiful
beaches I dream of the day when I can go

491
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,850
see your

492
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,790
Hemingway's house there which they've
really kept up

493
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,820
yeah really are that's great I I wanted

494
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,480
I want to visit their

495
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,620
now I've got a Mexican connection to

496
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,280
a but no I E R I'm a law-abiding citizen
who

497
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,170
who does the best he can so any more
comments I think you all look kinda worn

498
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,790
out go to bed

499
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:33,639
what what what he say

500
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,010
are you have to go to a mic up but you
who are at the might go ahead

501
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,150
I was gonna ask what's up a sociologist
India at the policy

502
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,650
the apologists a a couple at 4G is back
with a penis and I thought I was a

503
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,240
they could lot of Health trying to
achieve some the military

504
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,230
from the inside it's the military
actually came to miss are trying to

505
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,990
recruit them

506
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,010
right was it apologies America who
pretty much said a year to policies that

507
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,370
all

508
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,060
goes to help the military or advise on
any issue regarding Afghanistan Iraq

509
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,120
will be

510
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,660
we're getting the socks item after P
again but let me answer the question

511
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,630
first

512
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,460
arm number 1 I've reviewed a couple a
very good books on anthropology

513
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,170
and public policy and one other problems
that we have

514
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,520
is it anthropology the ethics of
anthropology is actually understand the

515
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,210
other people in order to

516
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,050
engage them in a constructive manner and
the military

517
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,899
the military wants to use the
anthropologists to lie to people

518
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,940
understand how to lie to them better

519
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,080
and the most fucked up program in the
United done this this

520
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,530
monograph on human intelligence and one
of the fifteen slices the Human Terrain

521
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,960
teams

522
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,190
and that is apparently the most fucked
up on ethical program in the US

523
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,810
government as far as using

524
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,600
humans and they're sending in
unqualified people

525
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,320
who are going in looking like Darth
Vader

526
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,030
I think media to help fill be at all and
an Aryan and they still fit

527
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,470
to begin with their not anthropologist
they're just someone who happens to need

528
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,340
a job in

529
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,480
said oh yeah I'm an anthropologist when
I speak Farsi -6 level

530
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,980
in our your Pashtun whatever yeah and
and so again it's a money scam

531
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,700
and unfortunately these people are not
only getting killed or getting other

532
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,860
people killed

533
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,340
anthropology is probably the single most
precious

534
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,770
a field of study right this minute for
the united states and for other

535
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,680
countries and were blowing it

536
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,780
arm so is there any way that we can.

537
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,010
conveyancer like you're dropping into
the military hire these people the

538
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,629
the specialize in what you want a

539
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:46,030
have already told you guys about the
somali thing I did the Somali piracy

540
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,889
study

541
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,180
in 2005 for the US Central Command I was

542
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,930
is really good that was when my high
year's 1.7 million

543
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,220
and up I studied Somali piracy s if we
gotta go in there and we've got to

544
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,180
contain this

545
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,210
and nothing happened and a couple years
later I had a chance to talk to both the

546
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,100
US Navy

547
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,480
irregular warfare guys and the Special
Operations

548
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,150
hunter-killer teams Arsene Wenger guys
take care the somali problem

549
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,910
and the answer from both was almost I
chemical

550
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,100
it's not an expensive enough problem

551
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,190
K now Navy irregular warfare right now
is spending all of its kind trying to

552
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,360
figure out what kinda shit it can fit
into the 5-foot

553
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,610
white torpedo tubes have an SS GN

554
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,970
so that the navy can justify nuclear SSG
and says

555
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,210
irregular warfare assets

556
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,560
it doesn't get any dumber than that %uh
so

557
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,699
the problem is not getting
anthropologists

558
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,150
to be picked up by the military the
problem is getting a military that

559
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,680
actually wants to do something

560
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,180
with anthropologists please let me take
a short break

561
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,470
and I will be right back and I'm quite
serious about staying here till ten

562
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,020
o'clock

563
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:11,020
but you won't make it

564
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,730
there

565
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,348
when your own government refuses to hire
you

566
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:32,500
you guys here the next best thing

567
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,349
skin Roberts you know that's true but I
but to

568
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:41,150
I just reviewed a book called the hidden
wealth of nations and it's run by very

569
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,740
smart guy who was a strategy advisor to

570
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,509
Blair and he talks about intangible
wealth

571
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:50,809
and getting along and sharing
information is a

572
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:53,970
huge huge wealth creator

573
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:59,170
on and we're not good at that we've
really messed up our suburbs in our

574
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,119
cities in

575
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,160
we've lost community I mean paul
goodman's community us is still a very

576
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,390
very good read

577
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,819
are so let's go here in front now will
come to you sir

578
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:11,920
your strong opinions about board
billionaire

579
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,500
Miley mares the city of New York I think
Bloomberg can be saved

580
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,819
on I really I read Bloomberg on
Bloomberg is a very good book the man is

581
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,119
a very smart

582
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,269
businessman he's a very stupid
politician

583
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:31,079
on he lucked out with Jackie sailor

584
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,819
and the independent movement they gave
him that election and he betrayed them

585
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,308
by insisting on a third term now I won't
hold that against him

586
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:43,829
but i watch Bloomberg make an ass of
himself in oklahoma

587
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:47,089
on he appeared on the so-called

588
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:52,869
bipartisan panel with david boren and up
all the people they're the only true

589
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:54,119
that we're still alive

590
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,640
were were Bloomberg and sam nunn

591
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,348
okay you had colon get senator Graham

592
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:05,619
head other losers I can ever remember

593
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:10,829
and Bloomberg had no idea that everybody
in the audience understood that this was

594
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,170
the two-party tyranny

595
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,650
making a mockery love any possibility of
his being a president

596
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,960
and heady had half a brain he would have
actually done what I suggest that

597
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,640
because he did send me a thank you note

598
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,009
on and then blow me off %uh I sent them
a binder I said you need a coalition

599
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:32,829
sunshine cabinet while your mayor of New
York to demonstrate

600
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:36,069
that you can create a balance budget for
the government United States was

601
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:39,839
sensible policies across these 12 areas
it doesn't get any simpler and im

602
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,269
fucking country on a plate

603
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:44,410
and he didn't want it are

604
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,920
so if anybody here sleeping with
Bloomberg or

605
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,769
talking to him %uh Robert Steele still
loves him and

606
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:57,339
he can be president but he's gonna hafta
think some new thoughts

607
00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:01,288
yes sir

608
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:05,039
in the back your are should answer to
fade out I wonder if I

609
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,539
family form like this question but okay
here we gonna give it a try

610
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:14,200
I'm so as unfold the Department offense
is the biggest funder

611
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,690
facing research in computer science and
mathematics

612
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,160
yes which is strange but true on

613
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,190
so I think the questions both go
something like this:

614
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,720
on now on the one hand that kind
research produces highly fragmented

615
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,200
results but it ended classified it yen
class fighter nobody gets to read

616
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,500
right not all of them but a lot of right
most of them food so then the question

617
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,390
becomes

618
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,890
on do you think in a decentralized model
you can still produce this kind

619
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,250
deep results and do you think you can do
it without on

620
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,000
without everyone having to squabble for
patronage from you know the cash cow

621
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,009
that's the Department fats especially in
academia especially naked

622
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:58,319
here I trucks pennies a good friend of
mine and

623
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,410
and we had lunch November 2 ago and &
Shop

624
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:06,680
told me something that this been burned
in my brain he said the Department of

625
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,019
Defense has cause the United States of
America to raise an entire generation of

626
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,539
engineers who know nothing

627
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:18,259
other than government spec cost plus
which is about the dumbest this way to

628
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:19,359
ever build anything

629
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:25,569
up vertically sense about 1986 the
government forgot how to do functional

630
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:26,950
requirements analysis

631
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,480
and statements work and so they hire
contractors to do the statement said

632
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,809
working of course contractors rate
statements work that demand that the

633
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,289
government by everything they can't sell
to anyone else

634
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:40,309
okay including all the people who are on

635
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:43,910
overhead and need to be on direct on

636
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:49,769
I think also that while DOT has done
some really excellent things

637
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:52,910
across-the-board the United States has
become a culture

638
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,529
cheaters is actually book called culture
cheating

639
00:39:56,529 --> 00:40:00,589
and universities have sold out they've
commercialized

640
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:03,839
on tenure has been abused %uh

641
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,839
the students are skating by not actually
being forced to produce anything

642
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,089
intelligent

643
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:16,089
poem

644
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:27,769
her actually have a boss it needs an
undergraduate degree

645
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,440
but it has to stand up to scrutiny

646
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,059
cut I

647
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:42,279
woo I

648
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:49,279
what he saying I can only speak for 50
more minutes

649
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,119
says who

650
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,880
here

651
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,420
here he i mean

652
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,349
I if the hotel is saying that for fire
we have to close this

653
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:10,819
what that I think they have to close
radio statler don't know I think we're

654
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:13,569
open

655
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:17,839
is this what you bring this to Manuel's
attention because he knows we're going

656
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,690
for a six hour record

657
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:23,180
and the six hours is in 45

658
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,589
45 minutes okay

659
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:33,109
all right we're good good

660
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:37,598
so where were we

661
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,000
are we keeping anyone awake

662
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000

663
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,799
alright so go on I mean all stop when
I'm order to stop the only guy here that

666

and had also he gave me permission I
think today go with the six-hour think

667
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,569

668
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:07,599
says were gone for six hours cell

669
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,940
week has six is good

670
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,309
a Dec 11 o'clock here bomb

671
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:20,239
yes sir yeah i i think a lot of the
areas here become like she's a great but

672
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,519
I I wanted to ask your opinion I love
love first of all

673
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,940
are President Obama's been a
african-american

674
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,039
and and how that plays into the fact
that

675
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:36,779
I dats worked him into the presidency
perhaps is given some immunity

676
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:39,880
on politically I love for

677
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,019
whenever he's done our hasn't done
perhaps pp

678
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:48,319
and and how that kinda please anything
in

679
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,500
other people in the things in the future
having you know the

680
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,390
on for been you know we can talk well
case no he's he's conflicted

681
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,750
are I love the black calf Obama

682
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:03,400
are that's the half that's no I'm
serious

683
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,500
collectible really I've I thought about
him a lot

684
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,170
on because I I really felt that he could
have been a change agent

685
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:18,180
but he sold out on and he also didn't
have any when he could trust near him

686
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,930
that would tell him that the dumbest
thing he could do is put rama manuel in

687
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,058
the white house

688
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:29,000
on you know so so I mean he basically
and and he's got general Jones is the

689
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,390
most senior clerk in the US government

690
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:35,970
okay a jones's confuse loyalty with
integrity

691
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:40,539
and staff work with thinking and and
these guys are absolutely worthless in

692
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:43,769
terms of actually helping Obama be a
great president

693
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:50,049
on but Obama is basically counting the
days till when he can join bill bradley

694
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:53,890
at Allen & Company on so he sold out for
money

695
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,868
and he doesn't give a shit about us but
his black ass is the half

696
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:02,930
that had one authentic moment and that's
when he said he could no more renounce

697
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,299
reverend right that he could renounces
on mother

698
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:10,859
that was a moment love deep deep
integrity

699
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,920
and he gave it up his white half

700
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,239
is so fucked up I'm ashamed of them

701
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,250
but in return I can't wear in when I'm
when

702
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,029
when yes he's getting turned on later he
turned on later but one of the things we

703
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:30,819
will realize is Reverend Wright was
quoting the US ambassador

704
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:34,400
and the reality is the United States has
done some

705
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,450
really terrible things in our name I
mean there's a list of over 200

706
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,160
things that we've done incursions and so
forth and oh by the way

707
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,839
we stopped asking Congress for
permission War two hundred years ago

708
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,910
okay I mean the US government is out

709
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,109
of control congress has given up its
integrity

710
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,529
I think every single senator and every
single congressman should be put on the

711
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:00,799
street

712
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,259
for the next three election cycles so we
can churn the Senate

713
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:12,119
can you elaborate more when a man you
why was the right choice

714
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:19,119
is a vicious unethical little mother
fucker

715
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:26,380
that's it I think that's enough

716
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:31,460
okay a I missed a good chunk at the
first part of your

717
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,799
talk so so I apologize in advance from
nice okay I'll call I'll

718
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:38,890
up bring up to date I think about an
hour and a half okay %uh

719
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,098
are you familiar with the book called I
think was called the economic hit man

720
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:46,809
oh yeah I love it Tom it's eighty
percent accurate

721
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't think he worked for NASA NSA
doesn't do shit like that

722
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,779
on I i think that

723
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:58,460
their their portions of the book that I
consider highly questionable

724
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,099
but I gave it a very strong review on

725
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,319
and in fact where he's most credible

726
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:09,859
is on things like corporations using
fraudulent religious organizations to go

727
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:10,819
in and

728
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:14,900
basically poison a village or or get a
village to move off a mountain

729
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,579
the other thing that people do is they
pay a Peruvian colonel

730
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:22,599
a million dollars to have his battalion
move the village of a mountain and then

731
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,210
a Canadian company comes in and takes
all the gold out and pays no

732
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,270
no significant export tax

733
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:32,400
I mean we've been looting the third
world for for

734
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,289
over a century on and and that's one of
the things it kills me because there is

735
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:40,089
plenty of wealth on this planet for
everybody

736
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,239
on and there's there's one guy that
walks around

737
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:46,450
saying that we really need to have a
guaranteed income for everybody

738
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:51,190
and and all I think the Lord's Prayer is
one of the most oversold

739
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,049
in coherent players I've ever heard

740
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:59,250
it seems to work for a lot of people and
their talks about daily bread

741
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,619
%uh home and there's no question in my
mind that if people have dignity and

742
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,299
food

743
00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:09,980
they're not going to kill each other and
so we're

744
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:14,259
yes yes and that's that's where really
emphasize that the human brain is the

745
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:16,869
one inexhaustible resource we have

746
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:20,140
arm

747
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,210
well you can have it you can have it but
but

748
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:30,210
you have to be content to just look at
it on a shelf

749
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:35,529
okay so the all along wanted that book I
I guess what my question is

750
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:41,170
is now is the way the book was laid out
where basically these corporations were

751
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,239
taking advantage

752
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,640
right developing countries to get
underneath the some the World Bank

753
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,430
is that like like an intentional
manipulation in the country from the US

754
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,598
government side of things or is it more

755
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:55,650
no thats corporate so it's capitalism
this region well

756
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:59,859
yeah and and and and Richard Barnett
wrote the original

757
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:04,319
arm book on this um called global reach

758
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,450
in the 1970s but 1974

759
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,480
and my senior thesis at me lover was

760
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,519
on multinational corporations and home
host country issues

761
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,710
including things like multiple books
creating subsidiary so that they could

762
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,059
move money

763
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:24,099
on and so forth %uh what really

764
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:28,009
happen here and as I see it

765
00:48:28,009 --> 00:48:31,989
the United States failed to help other
governments cover

766
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:35,969
and as a result multinational
corporations became a new power on the

767
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:37,099
planet

768
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:41,690
and it was a power that could avoid
regulation because we fail to

769
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:48,160
to internationalize service is a common
concern and regulations of common good

770
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,690
and then crime came up and it's very
interesting to me more races name is

771
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,989
written a very good book called elicit

772
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:59,430
the criminal economy is roughly $2
trillion dollars

773
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:06,288
almost exactly fifty percent of which
goes to government officials

774
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:09,559
as corruption

775
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:14,700
here

776
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,619
try reading the book is a oh one more
thing so now

777
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:22,089
on its it seems like that's the cultured
now where

778
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:26,489
it's based off can capitalism where if
you go back a couple hundred years

779
00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:29,650
1800 seem like almost like a hobby for

780
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:33,589
US political officials to either fund
were

781
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:37,180
build-up armies in South America to
overthrow governments

782
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,390
miss I don't necessarily know that was
for finer prime well-treated the

783
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,049
read my review of 10 whiners legacy that
shizz

784
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:47,880
on and there's also several other books
on regime change in

785
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,119
Chalmers Johnson is written sorrows a
vampire

786
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,299
on no I'm chance key Chomsky is written
because we say so

787
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:59,569
I mean there's a whole bunch of books on
this what it boils down to is

788
00:49:59,569 --> 00:50:02,890
we got very used to wanna diplomacy and

789
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,219
the we got very use to being big white
man on the

790
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:10,910
on the block on and we also got used to
being able to overthrow a government

791
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,649
with one navy ship

792
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,670
in1 you know company of marines

793
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:20,160
and we followed in the footsteps of the
British

794
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,399
arm there's a wonderful book called
where both the

795
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,829
deceit and basically

796
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:30,829
we like to the arabs and then we
betrayed the air apps

797
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:36,019
and for again I go back to Phila ballots
book the health of Nations

798
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:39,839
and I really tried very hard to work on
that on that review because it's it's a

799
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,839
brilliant book that covers multiple
literatures

800
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:48,170
and integrate some on we basically
imposed artificial boundaries based on

801
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,190
Western

802
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:53,200
Spears have influence rather than the
realities on the ground

803
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,299
and what those artificial boundaries did
was they disturb centuries

804
00:50:58,299 --> 00:51:02,460
of harmonious tribal on accommodation

805
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,019
in relation to resources and

806
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:09,900
sustainability love tribes in villages
and so forth

807
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,039
a I think we're we're at a point now
where we can kind every visit

808
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:20,239
everything we've ever done and the
processing power is there although we're

809
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,650
still not the US government still
doesn't process information

810
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:28,660
I mean it's still stove pipes collection
and doesn't process information

811
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,719
so I would be very excited if

812
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,469
if we actually did a clean sheet review

813
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,539
love love history and

814
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:42,819
the get away from lost history

815
00:51:42,819 --> 00:51:48,000
recover history again I come back to the
remark some inmates civilization is

816
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,219
about transferring the hard-earned
lessons of the past so that you don't

817
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:54,319
have to pay for them a second time

818
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,519
and I think the United States is in a
very very good position

819
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,759
to I think he's gonna closest out
somebody swarm I'm outta here

820
00:52:03,759 --> 00:52:07,769
no no I was asking if you need more Diet
Coke as you look like you're running

821
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:13,069
you know what neck I'm really starting
to love you I liked it before but now

822
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:16,650
now you're you're getting to me you're
touching me okay

823
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:22,410
I in a meaningful way for

824
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:25,558
II detail what a I think

825
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,960
I'm gonna wear these guys out by six
o'clock so I would say two more time

826
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,119

827
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,140
and we'll call it at six abut I will
stay for another hour with a smaller

828
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,410
group if it wants

829
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,759
well we have breakfast with the other
thing I was gonna say is your

830
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:44,259

will take you through 10 a.m. if you

831
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:45,000

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,819
high score like my fill of fast time
live love

833
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:51,430
I

834
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,810
you know it's like my

835
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:58,029
a rich it just went tracking down I

836
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:02,940
I'm I'm absolutely serious if you want
us to get you breakfast

837
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,170
rpm would have really I'm gonna go with
the flow

838
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,510
okay to go with the flow okay but I have
promised to cook hamburgers at three

839
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,530
o'clock so it's five hours away

840
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,760
of okay now

841
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,510
you were down there day

842
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:26,650
what no tennis at ten o'clock is

843
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:30,110
of no 3 what's 3 -5

844
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:33,580
that would be

845
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,750
3 -5 is 10 in the morning morons

846
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:41,400
if I have to be in Virginia at three
o'clock

847
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,430
the afternoon and it takes five hours to
get there

848
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,770
I have to leave here at ten o'clock
right

849
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,890
on

850
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:57,129
oh yeah I'm driving I'm driver

851
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:03,470
no worries occurred on Aug

852
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,880
I'll be fine I mean if I have to I mean
I'd that's why I wanna leave at six just

853
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,610
in case

854
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,960
I have to sleep for a couple hours
someplace on

855
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,760
but I'll go with the flow but I
personally think 6 o'clock is probably a

856
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,980
good time to

857
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,570
and it's a new record we can go for a
tax time

858
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:24,420
track I mean if you got eighty that's
frightening

859
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,140
I mean if you really wanna push it Salt
and I'm sure that we could take up a

860
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,520
collection to get your ticket

861
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,380
alright don't push it right now I like
you I

862
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,870
no actually what I need is a driver
because I have to take the car with me

863
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:41,900
with is that an actual challenge because
I D

864
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:48,900
I do have a magic wave making these
things happen what's that

865
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:55,860
no I'm fine I'm fine let's go with the
flow let's let's optimize

866
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:00,520
the thing here okay home to more Diet
Coke Rewards ako categorized as a vice

867
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,009
that wants to see you here at 10 a.m.
okay got it got it

868
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:08,440
give a round of applause from a colorful
scarf I'm using you shamelessly

869
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,740
yeah go on

870
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,530
so of freight you're still on

871
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:20,660
okay so I guess the take everything full
circle has a basically gone that a

872
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,370
like it went from manifest destiny being
like kinda like a a cultural inbred

873
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:26,520
think now it's just

874
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,100
purely economical but inherently the
same thing

875
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:34,770
in manifest destiny I think

876
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:39,200
was was a government that was growing

877
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,690
and and trying to be a big boy

878
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:47,030
among people who had been big boys for
centuries before it

879
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:52,750
home I mean we were like an adolescent
at our first

880
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,780
big do and

881
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,010
then corporations and I think Carnegie
and Rockefeller

882
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:03,950
really really and did a lot in this area

883
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:08,020
corporations essentially realize that
they could both to land grabs

884
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:11,030
and manipulate governments and so

885
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:15,770
that's when we started to see a decline
of government integrity

886
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:19,170
and rise love corporate

887
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:23,710
influence that ultimately

888
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:27,910
at this again comes back to the true
cost me I think

889
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:32,899
cash guys you cheer me up because the
more I think about it the more I think

890
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,700
we're at the very beginning over

891
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,550
really really cool period a time when
thinking will be beneficial

892
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:45,360
it could be

893
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,470
on now that's a good analogy the fog has
been clearing

894
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,970
and and now we're kind of coming out of
the fog at the scene landfall

895
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:58,630
on but I absolutely have confidence that

896
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,780
if I can harness five billion brains

897
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,160
there is no power on earth can stand up
to it

898
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,870
and they will be constructive what
senator

899
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:15,870
zombie your area

900
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:21,270
hits i no listen I lie I like having you
here because you make me look sane and

901
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,020
sober

902
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,530
I next

903
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:29,859
next cancer okay I have a question

904
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:33,040
abouts now I have

905
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,500
a question regarding how you would
respond

906
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,340
how you would think that the best
possible US response could be

907
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:46,760
to say door for genocide

908
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,960
yes said

909
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,000
if if you weren't if you somehow

910
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,460
control with US response should

911
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,780
well you know this that there's a
wonderful book called shake hands with

912
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,960
the devil

913
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,570
which is about how the UN order to
Canadian general to

914
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:08,900
not stop the genocide in Rwanda

915
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,940
and he went nuts over eventually
recovered

916
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,250
Canada has very good mental health
services

917
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,160
for english-speaking Canadians

918
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,980
and

919
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,260
harsh I love the French you know i mean
i i wanna learn French because I really

920
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,820
do want to spend the next twenty years
working for the UN was a source

921
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:36,650
socialite where you said the you want
the

922
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,780
know it's the book shake hands with the
jet with the the devil

923
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,340
by the Lieutenant General that was in
charge of UN forces in Ronda he was

924
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,740
ordered not to stop the genocide

925
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,900
on and the reason he was ordered not to
stop the genocide was not because the UN

926
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:58,900
likes genocide but because the UN did
not feel that it was within its mandate

927
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:04,720
now but you can kill a few and
discourage the others

928
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,420
a the bottom line is this: E the UN
bureaucracy

929
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,480
shows to limit you know i mean this is

930
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,960
this is an ethical question and it's
also an ethical question

931
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,320
for the person on the ground

932
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,670
at what point do you stop following
orders that are

933
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:29,440
on ethical and so I feel for the general

934
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,830
but I myself although I'm I'm now 58

935
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,450
and I have absolutely no qualms about
dying

936
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:41,700
even thought about tattooing a return
address on my back

937
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,340
because my wife doesn't get insurance
unless the body comes back

938
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,650
of but you have today

939
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:52,060
you have to decide if you wanna live
with the rest your life with

940
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,630
with not taking action and this is why
the man went crazy

941
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,240
he had ultimate cognitive dissonance
that

942
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:07,050
Muslim mayor at Fort Hood was suffering
from severe cognitive dissonance

943
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,460
and and I'm actually sympathetic to

944
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,910
the problem the encounter because

945
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:18,779
the industrial area system hasn't gotten
a grip on the fact that cultural forces

946
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,940
can outweigh

947
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,670
training and education and heritage

948
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:28,010
sold basically we should not be asking
Muslims the fight muslims

949
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:31,950
we should be know we should not be
asking American Muslims to fight for

950
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,910
muslims we should be asking Malaysian
Turkish in Pakistani Muslims to fight

951
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,529
muslims

952
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:44,530
okay are so we're really just clueless
on cultural intelligence

953
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,770
you think this is should be from society

954
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,030
I i think is his world

955
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:55,320
US at the time you have an old

956
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,830
week resources yeltsin use if I

957
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:02,840
say you should

958
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:07,480
well one of the one other things that's
happening that's very interesting

959
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,490
yeah that would be great with ice thank
you on

960
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:14,970
Nick thank you very much

961
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:20,109
arc yeah I'd say what the man as a saint

962
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:24,060
I mean he he

963
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,520
he's got what he wants later I'm not
worried about it

964
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:34,640
I no what

965
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,670
he's getting arrested okay arm

966
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,370
the US government is not trained
equipped and organized to be effective

967
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:47,750
either at home or abroad a

968
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:52,339
it's just a collection a bureaucratic
agencies that have grown over time

969
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:56,320
I mean the Department of Homeland
Security is just

970
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:01,640
the only thing worse that is the
Department of Defense

971
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:07,359
and so too are for is said its its
multiple kinds of problems first of its

972
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,799
an intelligence failure

973
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,410
it's a warning failure it's a cultural
intelligence failure it's a true cost

974
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:15,350
estimation failure

975
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,480
are it's a diplomatic failure its

976
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,370
a ER it's a political knifed a failure

977
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,540
its a failure i mean you know

978
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,790
when you when you run a government based
on one man winning an election

979
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:35,710
and then appointing his cronies to key
positions and putting 20-somethings and

980
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,050
30-somethings into

981
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:41,680
political appointee positions because
they shoe leather on the street

982
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,930
god damn thing about anything they're
being put in charge of

983
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:48,370
me this is its okay and high E

984
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,390
we had a colonel overruling
twenty-something

985
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,740
was shrieking and going hysterical and
saying you're

986
01:02:54,740 --> 01:03:00,220
pressed she's lucky she's not dead

987
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,750
arm which is we just an effective

988
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:09,800
dar 4 is the kind of thing that should
have been african reaction force

989
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,400
that is trained equipped and organized
to do that kinda stuff

990
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,589
and unfortunately the situation is so
corrupt

991
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:20,650
door for is about natural resources
nothing more nothing less

992
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:25,920
and so you have to have a legal
framework intelligence framework and

993
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,890
economic framework transportation
framework

994
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:32,650
me 10 things we found in Africa you
can't do intelligence country by country

995
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,470
after ever regional intelligence
construct

996
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:38,550
you have to be able to intercept
mercenaries as they're coming in from

997
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,690
all sides you have to be able to
intercept blood diamonds is there going

998
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,460
out

999
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,510
you have to be able to intercept stolen
cars from South Africa that are major

1000
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:50,870
source of income the reality is

1001
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:54,450
were like this nine hundred-pound

1002
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:59,720
baby in diapers who is just stumbling
around

1003
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,960
this is not an intelligent government it
is a government did

1004
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,970
like bill clinton says it it does what
it does because it can

1005
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:11,620
and unfortunately because it can

1006
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:15,109
stems in part from our apathy

1007
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:18,279
and are unwillingness to hold our
government accountable for our

1008
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,060
constitutional and

1009
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,339
and moral values yessir

1010
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:26,670
so with these $5 billion-plus brains

1011
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:29,800
on in the world right now what's the
fifty-year

1012
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,910
or 100 your plans for dealing with

1013
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:37,430
extreme population growth is if we feed
the world

1014
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:41,100
there will just be more and more people
no but the Smarty you get the fewer

1015
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,100
babies you have

1016
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:48,109
thats crew there for the world that is

1017
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:51,529
currently industrializing has it reached

1018
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,670
full industrialization and even the
United States

1019
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:58,470
the populations are changing immensely
fifty years

1020
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,780
or actually much less than that the was
just gonna for the senate Majority

1021
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:06,630
in the United States will be on

1022
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:10,190
Latin in web 20-25 years ago only

1023
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:15,100
to thank you late twenties for please
forgive me I miss the last seventeen

1024
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:19,470
works I think I read something by about
2050

1025
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,850
more than 50 percent have the

1026
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:28,880
American population will be let as
opposed to rate now in california

1027
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,000
cokie already minor I'm not saying it's
a problem at all but

1028
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,430
populations are still growing more than
a replacement rate

1029
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:41,970
well wanna one of the problems that we
have in the united states and I've

1030
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,070
reviewed the book

1031
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:48,130
there's like a national security
memorandum 2009 population policy

1032
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:52,870
and somebody went to a lotta trouble to
think through the implications of

1033
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:57,170
all the demographics youth elderly
disabled forward

1034
01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:02,030
everything and the United States decided
not to have a population policy just

1035
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:04,510
like it decided not to have an
industrial policy

1036
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:08,850
because we should be self sufficient me
right now there is exactly one place

1037
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,970
on the planet where the tyrant to the
M-one tank can be welded to the body of

1038
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,510
the m1 tech

1039
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:19,150
eat you take that out and we don't have
M-one tanks not that we really need them

1040
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:19,950
but

1041
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:24,040
you know it's it's it's a fact is one
really are in Cincinnati

1042
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,450
that is the major places three bridges I
could take out

1043
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:32,330
has won alaska pipeline is the Panama
Canal there's the

1044
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:36,240
really kiss of Navy Yard when I talk
about the submarine antennas on the golf

1045
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,870
courses in Maine

1046
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,910
for you know I mean K I

1047
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:45,810
it's just there are so many choke points
here on

1048
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:50,520
I think that number one we all share the
same DNA

1049
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,290
pigmentation is a yarn

1050
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:57,470
is a tiny tiny fraction of who we are

1051
01:06:57,470 --> 01:07:02,440
and I gotta say having lived a very
privileged existence my whole life

1052
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,520
I first encountered dark green Marines
in the squad Bay

1053
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,000
when I went through Marine Corps
training and I learned from my drill

1054
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,960
sergeant we have dark green marines we
have like rain rates

1055
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,589
but we're all Marines and same thing
with us we're all human

1056
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:20,350
on and in fact certain select human

1057
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:25,779
offshoots have different kinds of
sensing systems and thinking systems and

1058
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,180
and so forth

1059
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,180
I don't think population is going to be
a problem

1060
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:35,200
in the ideal world we would get to the
point where we have a balance population

1061
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,130
and we start methodically thinking about
moving

1062
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:43,480
outward in the cosmos and you know there
are over a hundred thousand galaxies

1063
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,890
and our galaxy has a planet that
sustains life I'm pretty sure they're at

1064
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:50,620
least 10 other planets out there that
sustain life

1065
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:53,839
and I'm pretty sure to at least 10 other
planets out there that sustain life

1066
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:56,350
percent I'll fuck what are we gonna do
when earth gets

1067
01:07:56,350 --> 01:08:00,120
shit together okay a

1068
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,630
so if I I think we're the very beginning
of a very exciting time

1069
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:06,839
I am actually not worried about
population growth because I'm pretty

1070
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:07,950
sure

1071
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,070
that if we give every poor person a free
cell phone

1072
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:15,100
and and free access to education one
quality time

1073
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:21,219
they're gonna figure out the math better
than we will

1074
01:08:21,219 --> 01:08:24,370
hi I'm I spent sometime in the

1075
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:28,160
in the military and in the Navy and I
room is something known to have

1076
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,809
for its a Coast Guard base you know star
handsome

1077
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:35,490
mice I was even talking I was a wee here
in a conversation about somebody wanting

1078
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,410
all the helical

1079
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:40,399
life you know we're going out to sea for
the weekend and I'm not terrible

1080
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:45,980
Marcos garden oh my god I won't be back
in time for money for my boyfriend

1081
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:51,190
but the roller Coast Guard has expanded
dramatically

1082
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:54,839
over probably last ten or fifteen years
or so

1083
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:59,390
up to a point of guarding her close to
actually invading other countries

1084
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:02,540
or enforcing our drug enforcement policy

1085
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,880
or arm yeah circumspect im seeding

1086
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,589
are circumventing her from I wanna say

1087
01:09:09,589 --> 01:09:12,799
on hitting other vessels in

1088
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,880
international waters for instance and
with information from their countries

1089
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,250
of course so it was so how is it really

1090
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,319
you know how do you feel about that and
well a

1091
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:27,230
I will tell you the same thing i would
tell the C&O you fucked up

1092
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:30,370
up because if the US Navy had taken
literally

1093
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:34,229
an expeditionary warfare seriously from
the time that I did the expeditionary

1094
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,049
study I was study director

1095
01:09:36,049 --> 01:09:39,479
I found at the Marine Corps intelligence
command as the senior civilian and we

1096
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,859
did a study on

1097
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:44,130
planning and programming factors for
expeditionary operations in the third

1098
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:46,560
world in the first thing we told the US
Navy was you

1099
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,400
gotta be able to do your shipment under
five fathoms

1100
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,640
arm and the US Navy wanted nothing to do
with it

1101
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,380
I absolutely fried several 06 is in the
Navy when I told them that we're gonna

1102
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,210
be down to 10 carriers by

1103
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:03,400
2000 I me they wanted be fired

1104
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,440
arm now having said that

1105
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,130
I think that a shallow water Navy is a
very important thing I've actually done

1106
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:11,870
the

1107
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:16,110
plan for $450 shipped maybe which you'll
find if I beta iota

1108
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:21,500
and it increases amphibious to from 9
percent to 11 percent increases

1109
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,990
the brown water up to 31 percent

1110
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:28,660
on part of the problem that we have

1111
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:33,820
is that the US Navy stinks or doesn't
want to do shallow water brown water

1112
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,559
Latour warfare

1113
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,070
and the Coast Guard desperately wants
Deepwater

1114
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:44,900
stuff on and it also turns out you've
got to be able to interdict further out

1115
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,310
so from where I sit and oh by the way
the Navy

1116
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,530
I don't know what the Navy was thinking
but they now have

1117
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:56,300
fire systems on ships that cannot be
reloaded it see

1118
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,340
which is always been one of our
strengths and they also are outgunned by

1119
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,850
coastal artillery

1120
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:05,270
around the world and I identified as a
prop in 1988

1121
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:09,600
and the Commandant of the Marine Corps
general Jones decided not to fight the

1122
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,210
C&O for naval gunfire for the rates

1123
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:16,719
and several comment on Sina Road decided
to agree on 1000 marine

1124
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:19,780
ships that are a sub skippers tree

1125
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,250
on so bottom line here

1126
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:27,830
is the US government is simply not
serious and and part of the problem here

1127
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:31,000
is the office of management and budget
they stopped doing management in the

1128
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,780
1970s

1129
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:36,900
and so there's no adult in washington
that will talk to the department's or to

1130
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,950
the CN Tower to whoever and say hey

1131
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:44,200
we not only have to do ports we have to
be able to do brown water

1132
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,769
have to be able to take II coined

1133
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:54,010
the term expeditor because it fits
between destroyer and frigate

1134
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,810
year and and you know the Coast Guard
totally hosed up

1135
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:01,380
naval acquisition but then the navy's
know better maybe can't build a ship

1136
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:05,170
today I commend your attention the book
on andrew jackson higgins

1137
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:09,780
and the both the one world war two on
andrew jackson higgins had the fight

1138
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,190
the navy shipbuilding bureaucracy and
this man was

1139
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:16,780
able to design build and test

1140
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:20,469
a landing craft variant in a 24-hour
cycle

1141
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:24,469
he was turning out liberty ships one per
day in New Orleans using Orleans

1142
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,310
citizens would never before touch the
welding rod

1143
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:33,200
on so I guess my my long answer your
question is we haven't done

1144
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,940
our homework and worse than not doing
our homework

1145
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:41,190
there's nobody in washington that is
actually able to manage across the

1146
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,560
parliament's

1147
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,890
and basically say we're going to do
planning a programming

1148
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:49,310
in this whole-of-government fashion and

1149
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:54,910
all by the way every airplane and every
boat that is built is going to have

1150
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:58,019
a super RFID ship and their

1151
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:02,990
so that any airplanes sold in Meddy in
Columbia can be shot out at the sky when

1152
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:06,059
everyone

1153
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:10,240
simple stuff I mean I got a thousand
airplanes going over guatemalan

1154
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,290
were getting two-year I mean we're just
not thinking

1155
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:17,420
this is that can answer your question
are ninety

1156
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:21,140
I think maybe a lil globally
clarification we see interdict farther

1157
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,190
out

1158
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:26,310
arm did you mean like internet above
international waters you envision a

1159
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,480
Coast Guard

1160
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,530
is that they're here to protect the
international calls I mean I'm sorry you

1161
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:31,110
nice

1162
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:36,160
nice state's coastline not here to too
late fall off the coast of Colombia

1163
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,650
amply like you know drug lowered our
mygearandme selection or something like

1164
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:41,210
that

1165
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:45,060
you're right and part of the problem you
have is it the FBI

1166
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:50,250
and and tean the US Navy sometimes are
running drugs in the United States I

1167
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:50,950
mean

1168
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:54,170
I was told by the head of the Special
Forces detail that

1169
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:57,800
he was assigned to cart ollie north when
he was personally bring

1170
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,900
cocaine shipment in the US and I
honestly don't know the truth of the

1171
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:02,810
matter

1172
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:06,850
but if you read Dark Alliance

1173
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,960
up blonde on was a Nicaraguan Contra

1174
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,280
who was bringing in strategic amounts of
cocaine and selling them

1175
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,950
Ricky Ross who became a black
multi-millionaire because he was a

1176
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,559
really great entrepreneur

1177
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,740
he was clear and two million bucks a day
in small bills are

1178
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,960
and he's the one that got arrested in
and

1179
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,960
went to jail blonde on kept getting
bailed out by the CIA

1180
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,860
on so we have a government without
integrity

1181
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:40,150
that protects drug lords for reasons
that are beyond comprehension

1182
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:43,170
and at the same time we have a

1183
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:47,630
Coast Guard Department of Homeland
Security bodies after budget share

1184
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:51,240
and the congressional committees are
part of the problem

1185
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,059
because a congressional committees are
using budget shares a wave allocating

1186
01:14:55,060 --> 01:15:00,250
pork and the going rate and Congress for
reelection campaigns as 5 percent

1187
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,310
for every year mark delivered so

1188
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:06,929
bottom line is it comes back to
integrity integrity integrity integrity

1189
01:15:06,929 --> 01:15:12,050
you're right the Coast Guard should not
be off the coast of

1190
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:15,340
Columbia but the US Navy refuse
admission

1191
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,790
I ghost wrote the article for the
comment on other marine corps call to

1192
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:21,620
intelligence challenges in the 1990s

1193
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:25,010
I was published in the American
intelligence journal and at the time I

1194
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,010
said

1195
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:29,150
the narcotics track is a tight

1196
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:33,330
threat it is not a distraction from our
primary mission

1197
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:36,530
it is a type of unconventional irregular

1198
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:41,700
threat that we must as a military be
able to deal with the US Navy said stick

1199
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:42,769
it in your ear

1200
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:47,370
we don't do drugs or we do drugs but
only if we get budget chair

1201
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:52,059
allocations cell the problem is the
system is not really paying bill to do

1202
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,270
missions it's being

1203
01:15:53,270 --> 01:16:00,050
bill to keep contractors employed and
and that is what's so bad about it

1204
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,080
a once again apologize underpins go go
go

1205
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:07,679
me of a a we all probably agree that
like saddam hussein is a

1206
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,620
troll Terry and dictator polly was a
very nice guy to his people are we

1207
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,490
should never have invaded

1208
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:16,790
will that's for my question now

1209
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:20,160
while he may have been gassing sums on
people in

1210
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,500
you know there are there some nasty
things going on it seemed the

1211
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,710
the country's a whole there wasn't like
this complete other laugh

1212
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:31,730
are like humanity basically there were
people

1213
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:34,920
killing their own citizens it was was it
really such a bad thing

1214
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,410
live in it was a bad thing for him doing
it but did the ends justify the means

1215
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:41,440
because it seem like they were getting
not along but they were killing each

1216
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:41,870
other

1217
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:45,760
well yeah I mean he had created a
secular state that head

1218
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,230
sensually enforced peace between the
Sunnis and the Shiites

1219
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:53,770
and and believe it or not nobody
bothered to tell Dick Cheney and george

1220
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:57,730
bush that the shiites when the majority

1221
01:16:57,730 --> 01:17:00,900
and that they were allied with Iran the
problem

1222
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,500
in and the whole rock thing is that dick
cheney

1223
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:10,740
committed over 25 impeachable offenses
and let the telling of 935 documented

1224
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:11,660
lies

1225
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:16,000
because the neo-cons wanted a rock and
they thought they could take a rocket

1226
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
no cost and only oilfields basically
shove the French in the russians out of

1227
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,940
Iraq

1228
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:27,860
on I'm pretty sure Ahmed Chalabi was an
Iranian asiana influence

1229
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:31,059
he spoon-fed cheney with cheney wanted
to hear

1230
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,679
CIA did not have the balls to stand up
to Cheney

1231
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:38,980
and neither did colin powell and so we
allowed Dick Cheney to take this country

1232
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:39,850
to war

1233
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:44,900
on a web of lies is it a coincidence
that it seems that all around Iran we

1234
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,469
have

1235
01:17:45,469 --> 01:17:50,130
countries that have at least militarily
we have interests in

1236
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:53,600
I honestly don't know enough

1237
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,770
but i'm concerned. that we're using
american taxpayer money to subsidize

1238
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:02,130
arms sales to people that are not our
friends

1239
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:07,830
and there's just no public interest that
I can think of the calls for army

1240
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:10,830
any Arab state and certainly not Egypt

1241
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,500
so all I can tell you is that were out
of control

1242
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,660
political decisions are being made and I
think our flight officers have betrayed

1243
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,410
the american people

1244
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:24,019
by confusing loyalty with integrity

1245
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:29,360
and just about any five of you you care
to name with the exception of Tony's any

1246
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,049
has betrayed the public interest

1247
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:37,610
thank you yessir and if you did make
flag that says something good about your

1248
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:44,610
integrity

1249
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,040
yeah thank you start of you talk about
the trail and so there's

1250
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,890
there are no cultivations who who have
this integrity everyone who

1251
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:58,920
you know is is in our government no one
really is stands I i

1252
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,210
I've been saturated what happened I
guess the question is

1253
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:06,090
what happens to people when they're
chill books on congress one is called

1254
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:10,120
the broken branch and the other one is
called betrayal of trust

1255
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,360
and I forget which one was written by
Senator Coburn but

1256
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,910
one of them has a subtitle love how
washington turns outsiders and insiders

1257
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:21,719
and it's basically fairly
straightforward are your first year in

1258
01:19:21,719 --> 01:19:22,990
congress your boo

1259
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:26,260
congressman and the party leadership
says listen

1260
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,770
Joe here's the way it works around here
we vote on the party line

1261
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:33,790
and if you vote on a party-line are you
get the big office you get the extra

1262
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:34,700
staff

1263
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:38,610
you get the TV coverage you get the the
prime committee

1264
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:42,110
science if you don't vote on the party
line

1265
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:46,120
you won't win reelection but but but all
that is not really sick

1266
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:50,460
that our system operates that way we
have to have some kind a 10-year

1267
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:54,120
in order to vote for what's right for
your I'll average which is basically

1268
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,710
people with integrity would say fuck you
and then they go public

1269
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,760
but the reality is they don't they they

1270
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,910
go along with the system I mean look at

1271
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:08,010
week we gotta go died he was like what
ninety-three in office I mean how many

1272
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,310
times you think it was really awake for
voting sessions

1273
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:15,990
or how much do you really think he voted
that wasn't attributed to the fact that

1274
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,380
he had 10 your

1275
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,410
in in in the system and he also I'm
staff

1276
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:24,030
that that did manage to vote sitting at
lobbyists

1277
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:27,450
who were working without pay that says
office

1278
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:30,870
well it is sick but I'm not here to

1279
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:37,870
to agreed that it's the right thing to
do I'm just here to say that's how it is

1280
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,100
are it seems like at least in in america
as a whole

1281
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:46,750
outside have like heavy political
seasons like 44 your elections

1282
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:50,060
that there's like a a fair manner apathy

1283
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:54,390
n little if any news coverage but within
the last

1284
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:57,690
few years you have like the Kolb era por
and

1285
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:02,960
I basic I love it comedy based political
shows where people like that

1286
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,679
that aged people I could not necessarily
make a difference because they don't

1287
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,570
have the income places congress

1288
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:12,349
the this is the white house in this is
what they do 18 to 30 if 18 to 35 year

1289
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:16,010
old males basically watching a show
that's entirely political base

1290
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:19,260
like is that like a good thing that now
you know

1291
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,300
a it I

1292
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:27,520
I can't say I cannot say I mean with
what I take encouragement from is the

1293
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,530
fact that

1294
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:33,280
to somebody that's going to sit through
the fucking night listen to me

1295
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:38,000
I mean that's maybe that's a to but up

1296
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,969
I really believe the truth has a power

1297
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:45,500
and it we've been sleepwalking on

1298
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,620
and we're now in a crisis a

1299
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:52,429
and I think there are more people that
are willing to listen the common sense

1300
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:56,010
and there are more people that are
willing to basically stand up and say

1301
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:57,960
I'm not going to stand for this

1302
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,140
and I think the congressional leaders
are

1303
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,719
really getting off easy because

1304
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,130
if nader

1305
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:11,170
I'm gonna do this so it can be turned in
to YouTube okay

1306
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:18,170
a in if Ron Paul and ralph nader and
Cynthia McKinney and Jackie sale it had

1307
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,020
the right track

1308
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:22,050
and integrity up front and center

1309
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:26,500
they would be coming together to demand
the Electoral Reform Act

1310
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,940
of 2010 to be passed on no later than
the

1311
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:35,670
31st of August even if it means having
to recall congress

1312
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:39,620
the fact that they're not doing that
tells me that they have sacrificed your

1313
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,710
integrity

1314
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:44,580
now one other things I learned in
attending a trance party since session

1315
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:49,330
is it all of the non-governmental
organizations are extremely nervous

1316
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:53,010
about any break from the bipartisan
system

1317
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:57,650
because it turns out they're heavily
invested and staff relationships with

1318
01:22:57,650 --> 01:22:59,690
Democrats and Republicans

1319
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:02,770
and they're very fearful that Emig at
that

1320
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:06,540
independents coming into power would say
are you kidding me

1321
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,940
we've been giving you two million
dollars a year to talk about

1322
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:15,290
the desirability of reusing sanitary
napkins

1323
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:18,830
that's a waste to the taxpayers money
they're terrified

1324
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:23,340
of the bipartisan gravy train running
because the bipartisan gravy train is

1325
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,420
basically bribed everybody

1326
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:29,770
to be part of the golan to get along
system

1327
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:32,860
so it's its its sick but I think

1328
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,250
that ralph nader and Ron Paul or Jesse
Ventura

1329
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,469
you know I mean I can give Jesse Ventura
a

1330
01:23:39,469 --> 01:23:45,410
a nonpartisan cabinet tomorrow within 90
days working with you guys and others we

1331
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:46,090
could have

1332
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:49,330
a policy actually already done it with
others we

1333
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:53,559
we have very specific if you go to earth
intelligence

1334
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:58,890
earth dash intelligence dotnet this
fifty two questions and answers there

1335
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:01,890
there is a a senator hurry congressman

1336
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:05,040
today or a cabinet secretary

1337
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,690
or an assistant to the President or the
president or Titan himself

1338
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:13,600
who could sit down and write those fifty
two questions and answers

1339
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,850
so I invite you to take a look at it we
could have a coalition cabinet up and

1340
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:20,690
running within 90 days we'd have a
balanced budget within 180

1341
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:24,250
actually we could do both within 30 %uh

1342
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:27,650
this is not for lack a brain power this
is for

1343
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:32,280
lack of integrity

1344
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,969
cases something completely unrelated
that on

1345
01:24:35,969 --> 01:24:39,179
now like in two minutes I have to pee

1346
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:42,940
also okay so maybe figures 13 now

1347
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:47,429
a place it seems like republican
republicans in general

1348
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:51,770
have mom wall richly nope big business
small government

1349
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:55,120
right it seems like they've completely
gone against that yes its its large

1350
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:55,650
government

1351
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:58,760
it still big business but the they've
gotten

1352
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,690
it seems like the porn on educated on
their side the two parties have morphed

1353
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:03,920
into each other

1354
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,870
it's just two sides of the same point
yes right exactly in fact is a wonderful

1355
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,469
graphics same bird

1356
01:25:09,469 --> 01:25:13,260
to wing same bird where am I going that

1357
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:16,560
I'll source fours like the Tea Party's
concern out now it seems like the

1358
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,910
republicans are really good at getting

1359
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:23,170
upper middle class people who yeah if
anything it to me at least it seems like

1360
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,810
borderline racism because

1361
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:29,330
Hispanic like leave not stereotype but
some other people that I know they're

1362
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:33,000
delivers are like the hardest working
people that I've ever met

1363
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,900
and it it just seems like veiled

1364
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,060
racism are they just going after like
this upper middle class because they

1365
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:40,450
know

1366
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:45,969
I care about is the Tea Party is being
captured

1367
01:25:45,969 --> 01:25:49,110
spend more time on this so let me take a
short break

1368
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:53,420
and then let's come back and talk about
the whole art of political theater

1369
01:25:53,420 --> 01:26:00,420
because although this is theater
o'connor this is real

1370
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:18,030
you know it's interesting ross perot

1371
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:21,219
was almost a genius on

1372
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:25,360
and I really I had a I still have a
perot

1373
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:30,230
for president sticker but he lost it

1374
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:33,710
i think is Eagle done this way mom

1375
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:39,090
and when he fired his two political
advisors one from each party

1376
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:42,320
on all this team went on and on now

1377
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,460
Jesse Ventura is not ross perot

1378
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:52,000
I I would support Jesse Ventura for
president i'd support Sarah Palin for

1379
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,820
vice president

1380
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:59,820
on what because she's a real persons
were you saying here

1381
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:06,019
thank you thank you because my my my my
plan remarks would've been grotesquely

1382
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,060
sexist in

1383
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:11,830
on you know but but yes she's a real
person arm

1384
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:17,110
and I'll tell you something I E I mean I
know some other people in alaska

1385
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:20,500
that are close to her and and they
actually really like ur

1386
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:24,320
are she and her husband were members the
Alaskan Independence

1387
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:30,330
party on and I personally think alaska's
being screwed by the United States of

1388
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:30,930
America

1389
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:34,180
and there's there's just a lot

1390
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:37,710
issues here but the bottom line here let
me put it in a different way

1391
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:41,960
all support any %uh view for president
the United States

1392
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,500
or vice president United States any
cabinet position

1393
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,380
because all we need to get this country
back on track is people with the brain

1394
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:55,540
willing to listen to other people and to
be transparent and accountable that's

1395
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:56,239
all it takes

1396
01:27:56,239 --> 01:28:01,600
for Lieberman subject

1397
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,150
weaving a South Park South Park what is
that

1398
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:07,889
near Meijer

1399
01:28:07,889 --> 01:28:11,010
okay another member you can talk about
the

1400
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:15,540
I I will tell you what is that spongebob
are no no not Sponge Bob

1401
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,570
I whose what's it what a crazy

1402
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:22,989
TV program with the guidance is all
politically incorrect things it's a

1403
01:28:22,989 --> 01:28:23,679
cartoon

1404
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:26,840
no

1405
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:31,730
yes The Simpsons I'm sorry but the
simpsons bear a striking resemblance to

1406
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,500
my family

1407
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:37,139
I alright yes sir

1408
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:40,409
I had a different question but before
you before you left your talk about the

1409
01:28:40,409 --> 01:28:44,060
struggle between the neo-cons the Tea
Party and it got interrupted so please

1410
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:44,570
resume

1411
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:47,920
well a party that part of the problem is
that the

1412
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,840
the tea parties being captured and and I
think I hope they realize it but they

1413
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,449
may not

1414
01:28:53,449 --> 01:28:58,440
just like Obama is theater the Tea Party
is theater its intended to give people a

1415
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,849
little bit of hope before they run into
the electronic voting machines were

1416
01:29:01,849 --> 01:29:03,190
everything's been great

1417
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:08,480
arm all of them all of

1418
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:12,369
someone very intelligent told me that
the bolt was the best of the lot

1419
01:29:12,369 --> 01:29:17,469
and they were simply stupid not criminal
you know I personally think people this

1420
01:29:17,469 --> 01:29:18,460
criminal also

1421
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:22,170
because that the ball president has said
on on them Open Mic

1422
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:25,210
that he will deliver the election on

1423
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:29,500
but what we have here is those people
who

1424
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,690
get organized I mean acorn is a classic
example

1425
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:36,849
on they captured and they become corrupt

1426
01:29:36,849 --> 01:29:40,230
on and what we don't have his

1427
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:43,420
Jan you want citizens moment I think
Jesse Ventura

1428
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:47,530
work some real magic in in his state

1429
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:51,050
arm and Schwarzenegger

1430
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:54,650
has been good I mean yes sure it's a
pissed off that he can't be president

1431
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:56,159
because they want him to

1432
01:29:56,159 --> 01:30:01,369
the president's luster can become the
52nd state then

1433
01:30:01,369 --> 01:30:05,079
you know all it takes is the ability

1434
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:08,099
to balance the truth in public

1435
01:30:08,099 --> 01:30:12,960
and that's why I am so opposed to all
the secret deals the health reform act

1436
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:13,320
is

1437
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,849
is all this obscure secret bullshit I
mean

1438
01:30:16,849 --> 01:30:20,239
in fact in in in Europe there's a
Copyright Act

1439
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:23,989
that is being voted on and the members
being voting on the Act are being

1440
01:30:23,989 --> 01:30:28,690
allowed to read the copyright provision

1441
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:33,920
the UK on there have been a lot to read
all the provisions and a lot of the WT

1442
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,099
own IMF stuff a secret and saw all these
triggers back and forth

1443
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,559
you know are our secret are so

1444
01:30:41,559 --> 01:30:47,139
I just I think that

1445
01:30:47,139 --> 01:30:50,860
we're going there we're gonna have to
get to to a crash point where people

1446
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:51,500
simply

1447
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,809
realize that the Republican and
Democratic parties are evil

1448
01:30:54,809 --> 01:30:58,050
home that their leadership cannot be
trusted

1449
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:01,820
that they do not represent the public
interest and a

1450
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:05,179
we would be much better off basically
going with no party

1451
01:31:05,179 --> 01:31:08,320
and electing people

1452
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:13,360
we tell at is a wonderful book alter an
aside where congressman start dying

1453
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:17,040
okay

1454
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:21,739
arm and not accidentally art a word if

1455
01:31:21,739 --> 01:31:25,739
if three congressmen road I in this
congress you're gonna see a lot of shit

1456
01:31:25,739 --> 01:31:28,809
pants being sent to the cleaners are

1457
01:31:28,809 --> 01:31:32,480
because if three congressmen in a row

1458
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,699
die that's not an accident and

1459
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:39,820
I think there's a spontaneous there's a
spontaneous

1460
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:43,500
anger in America I used to give speeches
for the American Council on Foreign

1461
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,510
Relations I visited 19 cities across
america

1462
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:50,489
and I was absolutely stunned at the
upper-middle-class

1463
01:31:50,489 --> 01:31:53,559
anger at the incapacity

1464
01:31:53,559 --> 01:31:57,440
and lack integrity the federal
government there is

1465
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,989
many Americans are not fools they know
they're being screwed

1466
01:32:00,989 --> 01:32:04,489
but they feel powerless and so I think
we're

1467
01:32:04,489 --> 01:32:09,349
waiting for this magic moment when all
the sudden everybody realize we don't

1468
01:32:09,349 --> 01:32:10,860
have to put up with this shit anymore

1469
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:14,000
fire the asshole and tell the new
asshole

1470
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,670
if he votes party-line we will recall
his ass within a week

1471
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:23,559
not a day

1472
01:32:23,559 --> 01:32:27,520
I would much rather keep my integrity
and have the affection and respect

1473
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,690
my community that have a larger office
but these guys are seeing if

1474
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:35,550
in a different way for rider

1475
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:39,250
if i may my name is Lou

1476
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:42,300
otherwise known as mo two years ago

1477
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:45,380
two years before that I gave chief here

1478
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:49,380
at the pool conference kinda sorta a
two-part speech

1479
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:53,800
I have to speak involved designing and
implementing

1480
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:57,099
and electronic in electronic voting

1481
01:32:57,099 --> 01:33:01,429
infrastructure that allow the people to
directly

1482
01:33:01,429 --> 01:33:05,780
select and elect whatever

1483
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:09,139
business wherever civic business that

1484
01:33:09,139 --> 01:33:12,889
they can conduct through the government
directly

1485
01:33:12,889 --> 01:33:15,989
okay the other part is that involved

1486
01:33:15,989 --> 01:33:20,360
replacing the current two-party system

1487
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:24,619
with a direct election infrastructure
I'm still actually working on that

1488
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:25,098
project

1489
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:29,579
actually more working on the technical
aspect that involving

1490
01:33:29,579 --> 01:33:33,630
using a hardware code if I could talk
for free subsystem

1491
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:38,900
resembling and depending upon a Trusted
Platform Module

1492
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:43,020
to implement that design as I said it's
a work in progress right now but my

1493
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,860
question is this:

1494
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:48,949
in your opinion based on your experience
with government as it has been for god

1495
01:33:48,949 --> 01:33:50,510
knows how long now

1496
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:54,059
what do you think it would take to

1497
01:33:54,059 --> 01:33:58,389
replace this to me party system

1498
01:33:58,389 --> 01:34:02,050
that has served succeeded and failed
this country for the past two hundred

1499
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,020
years

1500
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:06,159
with a system of direct democracy

1501
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:10,550
okay that can be securely and verifiably

1502
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:13,929
implemented I'm gonna try and get
through

1503
01:34:13,929 --> 01:34:17,349
are not a big question I know it's a
great question it's absolutely great

1504
01:34:17,349 --> 01:34:18,389
question

1505
01:34:18,389 --> 01:34:22,369
up and said okay

1506
01:34:22,369 --> 01:34:25,579
and what I want to try and do is is

1507
01:34:25,579 --> 01:34:31,159
figure out this computer I'm sorry

1508
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:36,219
writing a research on the screen

1509
01:34:36,219 --> 01:34:40,659
you're amazing pick up a captive each
book anyway

1510
01:34:40,659 --> 01:34:45,290
no charge

1511
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:48,909
yeah except for me on

1512
01:34:48,909 --> 01:34:54,139
let me go back to the briefing that I

1513
01:34:54,139 --> 01:34:58,480
that I gave earlier because I wanna show
you one side I hired Joe Trippi

1514
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:02,989
on for a little bit and i really respect
your trippy

1515
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:07,040
and we put together something that I'm
not sure I can show it to you right now

1516
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,940
but I'll show you some things

1517
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:12,599
sort of part of it

1518
01:35:12,599 --> 01:35:16,639
seek France hope

1519
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:23,639
2010 with teacher

1520
01:35:26,989 --> 01:35:30,130
you sites for

1521
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:35,699
okay here we go

1522
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:37,660
see use

1523
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:44,660
which apps

1524
01:35:49,179 --> 01:35:52,170
here okay

1525
01:35:52,170 --> 01:35:57,940
on trippy and I came together I was very
impressed by which it repeated for

1526
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:01,909
for Howard Dean who by the way has
broken with the democratic party

1527
01:36:01,909 --> 01:36:05,770
on and

1528
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:09,699
we came to the conclusion that what was
missing from the trippy

1529
01:36:09,699 --> 01:36:13,199
game initiative the first time around
was budget numbers

1530
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,889
and policy substance

1531
01:36:16,889 --> 01:36:21,099
and so we came up with this and the
whole idea here

1532
01:36:21,099 --> 01:36:24,849
is that for every line in the budget
there should be a one pager

1533
01:36:24,849 --> 01:36:29,050
that explains it there should be a place
where they can be a moderate the public

1534
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:32,929
discussion of each issue in each agency
with the spreadsheet to the US budget

1535
01:36:32,929 --> 01:36:37,989
and you should be able to compare
alternative proposals line by line other

1536
01:36:37,989 --> 01:36:41,280
Republicans and Democrats don't want you
to do that

1537
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:46,409
because they actually don't have this
okay they basically just throw money

1538
01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:47,060
around

1539
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:51,670
and magic happens here and they get
their five percent other contractors get

1540
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:52,920
their ninety-five percent

1541
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:58,489
we get screwed all but I don't know how
many have you seen the national budget

1542
01:36:58,489 --> 01:37:00,300
simulation its online

1543
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:04,590
okay that's a pretty good piece of work
and it could be made better

1544
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:07,599
but there's no reason why we can't get
too

1545
01:37:07,599 --> 01:37:10,690
today immediately my budget

1546
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:13,869
at the national level at the state level
at the county level

1547
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:17,549
municipality level and the only thing
you have to do

1548
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:22,790
in doing my budget is identify yourself
by zip code and by party preference

1549
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:26,110
and out of 65 parties not the two

1550
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:31,190
on and then all over the greens in a zip
code

1551
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:34,750
would have their budget aggregated and
all

1552
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:38,880
libertarians and all the power and so
forth this then allows

1553
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,719
a deliberative dialogue to take place in
which you can actually discussed

1554
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:50,460
trade-offs okay so I don't think we're
very far from the vision that you have

1555
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:55,219
and I'm sorry a camp show you the other
side because I'm not sure how fast I can

1556
01:37:55,219 --> 01:37:56,030
reach a

1557
01:37:56,030 --> 01:38:00,159
but I have another slide it's worth
looking for in Phi Beta iota

1558
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:03,270
it's a sly in which we

1559
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:07,960
self fund the political process and we
basically

1560
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,969
football the political action things

1561
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:14,760
out of business and we actually

1562
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:19,199
all contribute only 2h in Eric

1563
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:22,949
thing which will fund any candidate any
level

1564
01:38:22,949 --> 01:38:26,290
up to accent of course public free
airtime

1565
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:29,639
and the no 5

1566
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:34,520
27's or whatever they're called alright
we're getting very close to appoint a

1567
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:39,239
where we can actually do this and we can
do it first at the county level and at

1568
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:42,790
the state level and at the national
level but I we'll actually thinking more

1569
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:47,550
the local action been taken in ocean
myself for example

1570
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:51,219
running for mayor for small community
for example

1571
01:38:51,219 --> 01:38:54,340
there now no not share

1572
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:57,849
it's not a question of implementing the
current law

1573
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:02,810
it would be a question over reforming
the law starting on a local level

1574
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:08,050
and simply beginning a direct beginning
to implement

1575
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:11,580
and build a direct democracy
infrastructure like what is common in

1576
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,769
Switzerland for example

1577
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:17,730
where the people me at on a regular
basis and

1578
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:22,290
conduct there's a big business all
together in one shot and to actually go

1579
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,269
beyond that

1580
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:28,469
just it's a very good model and and I
agree with you my one reservation

1581
01:39:28,469 --> 01:39:33,900
is that I fear that local politics would
be used to consume

1582
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:37,219
the reformers and keep them from
national

1583
01:39:37,219 --> 01:39:40,909
reform so I have absolutely zero

1584
01:39:40,909 --> 01:39:46,440
I I am NOT a politician and

1585
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,530
I have no no real one brief exception

1586
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:55,250
remind as I said I'm more interested in
the technological and

1587
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:58,310
at on Mon okay leaning

1588
01:39:58,310 --> 01:40:01,310
VAX the technological

1589
01:40:01,310 --> 01:40:05,489
and would be so that people can conduct
their civic business over

1590
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:09,110
a secure a full and verifiable internet
connection

1591
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:13,830
that does not exist at this time I
intend to build

1592
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:16,980
so that it can be I'm that

1593
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:20,989
everything can be verified and tested

1594
01:40:20,989 --> 01:40:25,860
remotely using a TPM chips a dorky p.m.
like

1595
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:29,650
so that everything can be verified

1596
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:32,810
you know open source you know with you
but it has to be

1597
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:36,150
it has to be based on a cell phone not a
laptop

1598
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:40,099
you have to make sure that everyone is
eligible to vote either has a cell phone

1599
01:40:40,099 --> 01:40:41,599
or has access to

1600
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:45,409
like a public library place records
found first year on that option I was

1601
01:40:45,409 --> 01:40:47,300
thinking more like a live CD

1602
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:53,150
with the USB dongles where the dongle
held the TPM chips that

1603
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:56,270
gosh that was exciting

1604
01:40:56,270 --> 01:41:01,170
okay as I face the world as my eyes
glaze over

1605
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:05,070
I i would say make that up birds of a
feather session

1606
01:41:05,070 --> 01:41:10,900
let's move on because I working I I was
having constructive I do I hope to have

1607
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:11,880
something

1608
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:15,510
concrete within the next year not be
great ma'am

1609
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:19,239
what do you think given militarization
of our police their exercises foreign

1610
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:20,340
troops on their soil

1611
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:23,540
and disregard for passage comment on
this

1612
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:29,050
well first of the police are covered by
posse comitatus

1613
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:32,540
I'm not sure about foreign troops but I
am

1614
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:36,730
very very concerned about rumors that
I've heard about

1615
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:41,340
FEMA talking to various police
departments notably the Los Angeles

1616
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:47,230
Police Department about federalization
of all state police

1617
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:50,340
that is a crime waiting to happen

1618
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:53,929
and I'm

1619
01:41:53,929 --> 01:41:58,610
very pleased that some sheriffs refuse
to enforce eviction orders

1620
01:41:58,610 --> 01:42:01,920
I think we need to really look deeply

1621
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,210
and again this is part of scrubbing
congress we really need to look deeply I

1622
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:08,130
mean the federal government's out of
control

1623
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:11,510
said this many times it is out of
control

1624
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:14,630
and I'm very concerned about the
combination

1625
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:18,159
love man without a country in certain
places in

1626
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:23,610
Arkansas and Washington State there are
military compounds that are on

1627
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:28,290
marked that have people with no passport
to arm to

1628
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:31,570
would quite happy to kill US citizens

1629
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:36,320
we have US military people being
hand-picked because the answer yes to

1630
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:40,920
the question would you be willing to
disarm Americans

1631
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:44,900
and I think we're we're treading on very
thin ice in this area

1632
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:49,310
I'm also very concerned about all the
helper detention facilities

1633
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:52,949
one other reasons I want to legalize
marijuana release everybody's

1634
01:42:52,949 --> 01:42:54,610
put in prison

1635
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:57,820
for marijuana is because that will give
me a whole buncha pissed off guys

1636
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,880
know how to fight and

1637
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:05,570
I think we really really have to
seriously contemplate the possibility

1638
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:07,940
that the federal government is our enemy

1639
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:11,250
and I don't mean the good people working
for the federal government

1640
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:15,890
I'm really bad people managing the
federal government and

1641
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:19,690
I am NOT here to cast stones and I'm not
here to say

1642
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:24,830
reject your government I'm here to say
your government's lost its mind

1643
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:28,230
and we really need to figure out how to
get grip yes ma'am

1644
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:31,260
heard both keepers Oath Keepers

1645
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:38,260
no tell us about

1646
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:44,990
coalition law enforcement military

1647
01:43:44,990 --> 01:43:48,290
you are Reese wearing their old
Constitution

1648
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:52,880
as opposed to the chain of command thats
thats excellent I'm also very pleased

1649
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,300
with the citizens

1650
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:57,630
jury rights manual know juries

1651
01:43:57,630 --> 01:44:00,760
not only have the right to clear anybody
they also have a right

1652
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:04,420
overturn the law upon which accusation
was based

1653
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:08,570
and it's time we started enforcing right
are the problem

1654
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:12,330
with that is not him discipline that's
being

1655
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:16,250
even if its social discipline upon the
people

1656
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:20,140
warns already join keepers or some ride

1657
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:24,650
to you talking about yeah

1658
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:29,250
exist it's growing but its brown I love
it

1659
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:32,520
I would be very pleased if you send me
something that would help me post

1660
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:33,050
something on

1661
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:38,330
Oath Keepers on I think the Constitution
is a very valuable document I think

1662
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:43,519
long overdue for Constitutional
Convention I think it's time we

1663
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,130
got into the 21st century and I would
love to see a constitutional convention

1664
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:48,260
yessir

1665
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:52,340
0 are not fit the measures taken on done

1666
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:56,040
you're done okay we have a driver

1667

1669
01:45:02,190 --> 01:45:02,960

1670
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,880
no I I'm not quitting I'll be here as
long as this group wants me here but I

1671
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,900
have to stop

1672
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:14,580
10 rather stop 8 if you guys wanna go
for the all-time record so forgettable

1673
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:18,300
my chest it let's let's let's but 8

1674
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,890
you really think you can handle a

1675
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:25,780
but let's let's let's let's take a quick
do you want to take a quick audience

1676
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,230
ball

1677
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:30,420
how many people if he is willing to do
so would stay here until

1678
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:34,930
the next talk at 10 a.m. brown eyes fair

1679
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:40,460
a okay eight is a nice round figure

1680
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:44,840
how many people it would AP an all-time
record oh absolutely every double the

1681
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:45,950
all-time record

1682
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:49,230
over

1683
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:52,460
how many people one

1684
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:58,420
him to go until 8 a.m. round of applause
now that means you guys gotta keep

1685
01:45:58,420 --> 01:46:00,690
eating and questions and tell them yes
thank you

1686
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:03,400
okay and then let me know if there's
anything else you need a I'll keep

1687
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,070
techno

1688
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:08,290
his hand and although considered the
driver I generally like to

1689
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:11,430
drive myself because I P lot between
here in Virginia

1690
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:15,170
and I want to control

1691
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:20,560
where and when I are it won't will keep
staff here until eight guys

1692
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:26,210
Lee keep round of applause to this
energy energy going to ask

1693
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:30,000
but if someone needs a ride to Virginia
leaving

1694
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
at 815 it's possible I would consider
that

1695
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,160
because I have to put books in the back
seat

1696
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:40,930
okay %uh go on sir please

1697
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:44,290
other back to the on direct democracy

1698
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:47,430
what stocks the 51 percent That's

1699
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:51,800
easily influenced would say I the poor
be convinced that

1700
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,510
a death tax and estate taxes in their
best interest to get rid of it

1701
01:46:55,510 --> 01:47:02,510
from raping the rights of the other 49
percent II

1702
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,370
I can say is that I think education

1703
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:11,559
as very much abuse

1704
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:17,790
the whole issue a pro pic and

1705
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:21,010
me propaganda actually means to
propagate an idea

1706
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:26,700
does it mean to manipulate the truth and
it's it's the conflict divisions in the

1707
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,900
conflict of interest

1708
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:31,650
I don't have all the answers but I do
believe

1709
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:35,410
that if everybody is engaged or
offsetting balances

1710
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:39,370
and I really recommend this

1711
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:43,730
this book 90 some because the point he
makes

1712
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:46,930
is that it's not win-lose

1713
01:47:46,930 --> 01:47:53,930
its win win or lose lose and that's a
really cool point so again it comes back

1714
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:55,430
to community

1715
01:47:55,430 --> 01:48:00,900
it comes back to understand we can't
survive without one another

1716
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:04,880
and I have no real answer that's
definitive

1717
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:08,900
other than to say I think we're at a
point now where the poor have the most

1718
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,350
to gain by being smart

1719
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:16,010
on I was going to answer that question
partially myself

1720
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:19,130
there's you're right there's no fast
definitive answer

1721
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:23,410
I have anyone would decide to read the
federalist papers for example James

1722
01:48:23,410 --> 01:48:24,150
Madison

1723
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:28,700
and a lot of the other early adopters
I'll the original Constitution

1724
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:32,860
gave various warnings about that
particular situation

1725
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:36,540
that would depend in large part on the
structure

1726
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:39,820
that would be implemented as well as the
improvements that could be made

1727
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:44,049
thereafter so as I as he just said
there's really no hard-and-fast

1728
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:48,960
answer what the federalist papers that
were written two hundred years ago

1729
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,990
would be a good place to start yeah

1730
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:56,660
the journey of the minorities is very
good I mean what I like is the native

1731
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:59,150
american principle which basically

1732
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:04,450
is what we're doing here is nobody
leaves until we agree

1733
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:08,910
its remarkable how that brains and
consensus

1734
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:13,830
speak is the the filibuster the
individual actually leads to i mean I

1735
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,460
was

1736
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,950
very impressed Denmark I completely lost
my cool

1737
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:22,019
with with this black guy who thought
Lincoln was the Savior

1738
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:26,710
had no idea that Lincoln did the
emancipation proclamation

1739
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:30,790
just as military necessity and it only
applied to those in the south

1740
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:35,250
not apply to the northwest and and he
had no clue that the South

1741
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:41,200
carpet packed for 12 years after the war

1742
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,990
as I got very angry at him but in the
process of getting angry at him which

1743
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:49,610
I realized I should never ever do it
again I saw

1744
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:53,490
the remarkable integrity of the day
Danish people

1745
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:57,130
they have learned how to talk without
getting angry

1746
01:49:57,130 --> 01:50:01,980
and they have learned how to Lee out
extremely important complex things and

1747
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:03,590
how to disagree

1748
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:08,370
that frankly has never been my strength

1749
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:12,230
well but into collagen non-violent
communication

1750
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:15,950
and I mean I almost have a churning in
my stomach now as I realize how much I

1751
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:16,769
failed

1752
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:19,870
how much they've succeeded I mean the
whole Danish

1753
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:24,170
Tom atlee whose books I recommend call
intelligence

1754
01:50:24,170 --> 01:50:27,960
creating a world that works for all and
its more recent book cover reflections

1755
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,300
on evolution

1756
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:34,490
revolutionary activism on tom is the one
who introduced me the whole idea of the

1757
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:36,269
Danish citizens

1758
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:40,610
wisdom Council I mean when the danes
want to consider something like

1759
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:44,950
whether they should import genetically
altered quarter

1760
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:49,190
they pick 12 Danish citizens whose only
qualification is that they know nothing

1761
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:50,940
about the subject

1762
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:54,110
and then they have the status of the
Supreme Court they can call witnesses

1763
01:50:54,110 --> 01:50:57,810
they can interrogate people they can
subpoena documents

1764
01:50:57,810 --> 01:51:01,670
and at the end of it these twelve people
to sign on behalf of Denmark and that's

1765
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:03,320
the way it's gonna be

1766
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:08,299
I mean that's really cool and I really
want to emphasize the fact that the 12

1767
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:08,920
people

1768
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:12,910
are chosen for lack of knowledge about
the topic

1769
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:16,200
for their common sense

1770
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:23,200
really

1771
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:29,500
well that that makes a lotta sense

1772
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:33,240
in some ways unfortunately

1773
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:37,490
right but but instead what we have now
is the least qualified in the job want

1774
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:39,260
the job

1775
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:43,860
and make a hash other so all right sir

1776
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:47,090
so actually that kinda tight infernos
NASCAR

1777
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:50,460
what I was expecting is what I think
it's been

1778
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:53,910
going on that my head for all for a
while is if we got rid of all the

1779
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:54,980
politicians got

1780
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:58,480
stop making professional liars and
professional politicians replaced all

1781
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,650
the politicians with engineers

1782
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:04,490
and even worse and and and

1783
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:08,120
with the engineers still had to hold
themselves to their code of ethics

1784
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:11,570
and it is so that the there's an
engineered coated ethics there are

1785
01:52:11,570 --> 01:52:17,049
several

1786
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:20,900
okay he said that you have to exit the
system actually develop

1787
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:25,570
okay keep going so if you if you replace
all these professional workers

1788
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:28,630
on people who are going to school to
become politicians with

1789
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:32,140
engineers who go to school there do
things methodically logically

1790
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:36,060
get things done and not worry about you
know trivial things don't actually

1791
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:39,420
and focus on what's important do you
think that would be

1792
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:44,290
up a change that could potentially work
in an ideal world where it might

1793
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:46,090
actually happen

1794
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:50,210
well you know Joe Fox from IBM wrote a
book

1795
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:53,840
for it title quite a bit about quality

1796
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,260
but he said the opposite

1797
01:52:57,260 --> 01:53:02,190
virtue is not vice its virtue carried to
an extreme

1798
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:05,260
one other things i think is bad any
system

1799
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:08,650
is a

1800
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:12,550
mono poly you know it's the only thing

1801
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:16,290
worse than all politicians is all
everything else

1802
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:19,460
so I would never want all engineers side
one I mean

1803
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:22,480
eel Wilson wrote a book called
conciliate

1804
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:27,030
which answers the question why do the
sciences the humanities

1805
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:31,230
yes it is and it's one of the toughest
books I've ever read it's absolutely the

1806
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:33,770
most intelligent footnotes I've ever
read

1807
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:37,200
this is one of those books where start
with the index go onto the footnotes and

1808
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:40,550
then read the book

1809
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:45,030
I think it's actually one about 3 that
I've had to read that way

1810
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:48,179
so it's not about all engineers

1811
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:52,290
it's about diversity clarity integrity

1812
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:56,040
and it's about making sure that every
voice is heard wonderful literature

1813
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:56,650
merging

1814
01:53:56,650 --> 01:54:01,280
voices lost we have sacrificed so much

1815
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:05,980
repression the end indigenous people
including century's worth of learning

1816
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:09,030
century's worth experience on

1817
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:12,610
and also I'm I don't wanna

1818
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:18,780
to far carried away with this but
engineers like Soul

1819
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:22,450
a.m. also Eagle way to be way to a

1820
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:26,800
and so you know the rational methodical
is not always the best way to get

1821
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,760
someplace

1822
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:33,100
it may be that you need a little bit
lunacy and a little bit of humanity

1823
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:39,230
and so forth

1824
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:42,930
do we have sheep units

1825
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:46,690
is that a is that like a sheep having an
orgasm for

1826
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:50,240
yeah mass

1827
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:55,660
food for

1828
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:59,490
well the same ones can move forward yes
sir

1829
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:03,679
Danica so I said and one other question

1830
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:06,810
which Israel a lot education

1831
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:10,170
and I guess something i've seen recently
at least with

1832
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:13,310
my college education things I've been
going through is that

1833
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:16,370
it seems like the current political
environment

1834
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:20,330
was determined other people were using
to describe particular situation

1835
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:23,880
has had a negative impact on the
creativity

1836
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:28,250
that students are allowed to express and
I'm wondering if you see that if you see

1837
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,590
any resolution to that

1838
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:33,460
near future for we've we've really blown

1839
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:38,860
I mean we're so focused on credentialing
we've completely dismiss learning

1840
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:42,100
and their number books at the that over
80%

1841
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:45,100
books in education category Phi Beta

1842
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:48,470
biota I mean among the books that have
really impressed near

1843
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:52,820
orbiting the giant hairball and weapons
of mass destruction

1844
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:58,700
I just recently reviewed a book on why
students don't like school

1845
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:03,730
there's just a bunch of and
unfortunately I think we have learned to

1846
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:08,070
manage ourselves to the lowest common
denominator

1847
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:11,710
and we we tend to focus on the twenty
percent worst

1848
01:56:11,710 --> 01:56:15,990
a twenty-percent best in that we kinda
just like leave the middle own

1849
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:19,500
we we're totally off base with respect
to

1850
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:23,100
rote learning I mean we have

1851
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:26,430
1950 school system

1852
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:30,170
and we don't do team learning we don't
do learning to learn

1853
01:56:30,170 --> 01:56:36,160
we don't tune of hands-on we

1854
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:41,730
we don't use the on yeah outdoors
absolutely

1855
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:45,990
we've we've sacrificed art and music and
it turns out art music help you think

1856
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:47,740
better

1857
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:51,160
week sacrifice physical education
cultural studies we

1858
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:54,980
bastardized college I mean everything
from

1859
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:59,420
feminazis to

1860
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:04,160
call truth black lesbian

1861
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:08,809
one leg good to do you know Kaman

1862
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:12,150
liberal arts should be about learning to
think and

1863
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:16,430
it shouldn't be about forcing specific
little things in there

1864
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:20,430
so education is hosed and I really go
with Plato's

1865
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:24,290
comment which will tour and brought to
my attention which is the single most

1866
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:25,690
important role

1867
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:29,640
love any organization is to teach
educate

1868
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:35,500
to to create organization intelligence

1869
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:35,840
yes
