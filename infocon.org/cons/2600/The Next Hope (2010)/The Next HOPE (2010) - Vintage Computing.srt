1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,090
your history and the women are here to

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,910
talk to us about a one other technical
aspects run the History Channel on his

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,540
roots of

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:15,000
time close I

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm we're a on bill Degnan this is Evan

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,890
called once and were from the middle and
a greater computing hobbyists

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,050
were group love people who I believe in
conserving the history of computing

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,050
and our focus is in the middle anchorage
in the United States

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,589
okay how we're gonna start with eniac
there are

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,860
many miss about eniac for example

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,399
that a first computer not even close to
true it's the first fully electronic

12
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,360
program ball digital store program
computer and at first it was an even

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
sharper interviewer

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,600
I however the ones hour before it

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,329
weren't declassified told the kids later
like losses in Britain

16
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,890
another message as I was on reliable

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,720
eniac and 19,000 back in tubes and
there's a myth that people were on

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,220
roller skates running around the room
costly genie back in jobs are blowing

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:13,570
out

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,039
try but not for the reason you think
it's not the to try reliable these guys

21
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,850
had access to the best teams money can
buy

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,509
when you're ninety thousand anything
there's gonna be some break in the given

23
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:24,970
time

24
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,039
so it was a problem love quantity not a
quality

25
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,360
but my favorite method that eniac

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,350
are is at he was designed to computer
directories a mortar rounds are all were

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,780
two

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,929
every history book about any access ass
gospel

29
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:46,789
and it's just not true here's what
actually happened john motley

30
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:52,229
the brains behind eniac was a physics
professor at her side as college in 41

31
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,450
outside thought of you up inured a
better paying job

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,649
so he applied to places he apply to the
%ah

33
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,709
Singapore radar lab at for mom at the
Jersey he got an offer but didn't a lot

34
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,599
and you fight a pet he took the 10 job
also been employed

35
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,230
a lot but he made extra money doing sigh
contract to the army

36
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,290
whatever's contracts was for the

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,670
singaporean our lab that he declined the
job and the idea for digital computer

38
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,010
had been in the air since late thirties
it's not like he really wants working on

39
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,649
it was a race to build one because he
already had differential analyzers news

40
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,150
like that

41
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,010
anyway he started teaching physics a pen

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,870
and forty-one and yes I contract and the
contract was a juror may of

43
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,239
for a parabolic radar antennas for for
mom if

44
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,370
and he went all around University
Pennsylvania

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,980
you want to warn the business school
there gather all the cattle and

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,959
emissions you can find

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,760
and it wasn't enough manpower to watch
was boss the physics department head and

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,660
say boss

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,280
you know those newfangled digital
computers knock a reason to build one

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,900
to get these crazy reorganize the army
of my back and the boss said good idea

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,040
but the army will never go forced to
obscure come up with something else

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,120
so we sell weather map problems as the
army have

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,030
any rise a whole thing about the human
computers trajectories and water routes

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,690
so on the funny proposal he wrote down
give me my the bill this mister armey

55
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,890
so I can compute trajectories butter two
problems one is at

56
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,680
that just when you wrote to get the
money not what you actually want to

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,660
build a computer for

58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,680
and second the war ended before the
computer was ever finish

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,010
arm so that is the

60
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,010
see hidden story up why eniac was
actually built

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,150
and I don't know if you got to see the
screen some technical details are

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,980
and yet was finished by 45% interest
Republican forty-six

63
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,020
arm it the idea the program

64
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,480
was just patch cords basically arm

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
not unlike an Alltel phone operator
station and arm

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,330
you I want you to PowerPoint karaoke by
I'll

67
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,690
want the biggest problems with it was at
it was very slow to program

68
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,410
na hard a program for to slaughter
program so that was a big drawback of it

69
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,670
it was actually use for the census
bureau Nuclear Research

70
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,950
and at a picture

71
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,100
it was are in a room 30 by sixty arm

72
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,130
the man work technicians to win or
programmers programming was woman's work

73
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,550
not how I feel arm

74
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,360
and all the programmers were the
smartest female math majors a pen

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,750
you pick up a dictionary that then
compute or with an all are meant to

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,130
human operate the machine

77
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,930
not computer in the machine itself the
back into development committee met at

78
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,100
the Empire State Building

79
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,600
in the ER forties said he was mid to
late 40s

80
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,860
and it was subcommittee of all the
nation's top

81
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,320
engineers and technical managers to
figure out better ways

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,270
to push commercialization and practical
uses a vacuum tubes

83
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,539
so that the military could have them for
lower-cost

84
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,000
electronic associates was ER

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,669
leading analog computer company %uh this
time

86
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:11,450
well into nineteen seventies and it was
a spin-out

87
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,840
I love the after mention Singapore radar
lab which is now our museum in wall New

88
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,320
Jersey

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,950
at an analog computer

90
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,370
ok about the second of

91
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,470
so that's what I meant even know any
opposite from you that's what I meant by

92
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,919
the patch cords you know that

93
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,919
the where they put in that was the
program this is fun

94
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,310
on when Bell Labs perfected not invented
the transistor

95
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,720
Bell Labs internal staff and all the
nation's top scientists said

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,090
we have to keep this secret on the
american have this

97
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,860
animating harold's all who was technical
director

98
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,640
love the army base in our museum arm he
fought to make a public and he said no

99
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,260
it's too important a role needs it

100
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,340
and you wont thereby same transistors
impact publications forward a good ten

101
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,280
fifteen years

102
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,940
that's the first

103
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:15,940
portable transistor yes thank you for
the car commentary film um

104
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,729
no i dnt this one 21 after

105
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,530
you know you know more about this okay
of down the hall from work collapsed in

106
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,169
the transistor Murray Hill New Jersey

107
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,750
clutch at in are his paper and I was
basically the preeminent paper on

108
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,770
Information Theory

109
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,380
done settle Jersey good stuff

110
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,930
there's an issue theme yes this is one
of my favorite things all

111
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,659
Moby Dick our mobile digital computer
course Moby Dick because well

112
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,099
it is the world's second portable
computer

113
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,550
on the first one was called by sea act

114
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,610
it was 244 trailers arm

115
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,640
he was the world's first appeared is
printed circuits and it was designed by

116
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,280
the National Bureau standards in

117
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,539
Washington DC and the customer was the
white sands missile base

118
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,090
the Singapore out there but it was so
primitive circuit boards

119
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,440
that the ship it out there in the white
sand got in circuits and never worked

120
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,210
anyway three years later they struck it
down to three aces size 130 for trailer

121
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,630
left if you want I S II understand the
humor here

122
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,969
but this was in fact the first computer
number alt

123
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,280
that went to where the problem was he
said the problem going to rate was

124
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,190
now we have iPhones but portable
computing had to start somewhere on in

125
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,340
addition to all that

126
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,270
it was easy third or fourth computer in
the role to transistors

127
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,700
and it was the first computer near alt
to talk to other computers different

128
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,510
makes and models in a common format hot
field data

129
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,010
before this sir tomatoes IBM computer to
talk to each other but only the same

130
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,510
model

131
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,979
they had 45 different companies all made

132
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,860
yielded a compatible computers into the
first time to computers to talk to each

133
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,330
other

134
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,109
arm now there was no wire he was passing
punch cards there was a common format

135
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,060
for the first time ever

136
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,979
the first nigger net you could say and
no data became something you've all

137
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:07,680
heard of called

138
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,080
asking arm but my favorite favorite
thing about his computers a story with

139
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
her for the man who invented it

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,850
that they want to send to Europe to talk
about six cities

141
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,460
and the army several yes it's a computer
but it's also an army truck

142
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,690
in all army trucks have beat us at the
Abbey proving ground first ruckus

143
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,440
so they drove the computer if you will
from the Jersey tapia Maryland

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,110
and the computer came through test
wrapper flying colors but the army truck

145
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,449
broke down

146
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:40,900
on the other story of my deck was at arm

147
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,350
the reason they was part on the first
place was two guys at this Kevin slap

148
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,699
wanted a ya IBM 704

149
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,719
and a government said no money for
several

150
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,560
people our own arkady and that was
pretty common thing back then

151
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,250
and the army's okay we'll give you money
for computer but it's for fuel

152
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,510
technology

153
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,910
so the engineers for your engineer civil
war but wheels on it

154
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,910
to get your head whilst offering
computer that topic in portable

155
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,170
this is just a a cover of a magazine to
illustrate the beginning

156
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,339
of the industrial a Juve computing

157
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:22,230
the arm the air when computers were
commercial

158
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,600
of course they were large in their only
on by large corporations in the military

159
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,190
but that's what this is all about

160
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,760
at the same time there were people
beginning to hack computers

161
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,740
and one of the first things a I but in
computer wrist

162
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,760
would on purchase would be to

163
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,810
I get a analog computers such as this
one

164
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,380
on this one's called the genie ac and
you would buy this at a catalog

165
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,250
on in New York City I'm and you take it
home you be able to do a series of

166
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,120
experiments adding and subtracting

167
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,699
not

168
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,810
okay the resistors I'm not remember what
it stands for

169
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,530
radically emphatic students human rest
of

170
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,230
interested interested I don't know it I
V

171
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,000
it's all good to Wikipedia arm it was a
high school computer club

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,240
for my club Kagan who was a Western
Electric employees

173
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,240
in da hopewell New Jersey which is just
outside princeton

174
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,490
are I don't know later with the roles
for special computer burn off but it was

175
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,319
certainly one of the earliest

176
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:33,540
in Claude barn he had a borrows

177
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,530
to a lecture day to slash burrows 2005
mainframe

178
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,790
heckuva computer he also added Dec PDP
straight

179
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,290
the original model the PDPA and %uh that
was given to him by Dec when it was new

180
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,480
in 1965

181
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,140
arm what a lesser slices cut off our
netbook

182
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,449
Arnold girls a project might da he in
addition to computing

183
00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:00,720
also arm sought out underprivileged I'm
children kids and high schools and

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,440
brought them in as well so that he

185
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,770
help bring I'm computing to people not
just our

186
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,829
people who went to MIT and whatnot he
was actually trying to find

187
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,850
students that were in underprivileged
schools to

188
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,720
illustrate the fact that anybody could
learn computing and that's one of the

189
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,060
themes

190
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,319
that he followed throughout the
organization right now in da club

191
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:25,089
die his students 1970 brought that PDPA

192
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:29,209
to a computer conference I think was in
France and on they were shot by

193
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,000
everybody all scientist

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,180
summit aside his approach clot basically
told him off and said what are you

195
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,699
wasting a computer on children for

196
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,730
are you crazy are and obviously he was
right and they were wrong

197
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,870
are in our museum today we have actual
PDPA

198
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,589
including the ER original saw from paper
taped

199
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:53,880
and clover lane which called Sam 76
almost like basic apps time

200
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,370
and Om eventually the club disbanded by
the early seventies

201
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,780
face at around us today in smoke pot arm

202
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,819
unfortunately the barn burned down last
year the bros 2005 assist Roy

203
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:08,410
before you have a chance to save it boy
did say the PDPA

204
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,760
and often caught also wrote a paper
about the whole

205
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,140
reckoner in the late separate 60's early
70's

206
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,740
which she described all the components
of a modern PC

207
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,689
now that was already been done by you
know xeroxed Park in West Coast

208
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:29,689
but it was kind of new to the scores at
a time and he thought it independently

209
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,670
enter data was a spin out of luck charm
associates omission earlier

210
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,479
argue was easy only company other than
deck at a time to do a 16-bit

211
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,280
minicomputer arm yet

212
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,250
and Dom the company was called in there
was acquired by perkin-elmer

213
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,990
which was acquired by concurrent
Computer Corporation which store around

214
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,750
today

215
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,929
so it's important New Jersey connection

216
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:59,260
okay this this slide talks about sky
branch you talk a little bit we've

217
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,839
we've illustrated something important
historical

218
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,100
are vans and milestones that

219
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,569
tied to the mid-atlantic region on

220
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:14,219
this this next group tomorrow takes us
to the next generation where we began

221
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,270
seeing the homebrew hacking ara

222
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,510
other premarket period where on
employees of companies like

223
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,920
on Intel into perkin-elmer and

224
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,079
and you know electronic associates et
cetera

225
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,240
on would have gone home taken little
bits and parts that were

226
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,490
that fell on the ground or were
sub-standard ever start building our own

227
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:35,949
little

228
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,520
interfaces on the work creating
computers

229
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,100
at that time what they were doing were

230
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,850
automating the process is perhaps so far
other words a ham radio enthusiasts and

231
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,189
they were finding ways to use computing

232
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:54,240
to automate the process of you know
checking a lot of channels at nine so on

233
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,589
or

234
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:58,100
just connecting to a television set so
they could do typing

235
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,770
I in fact this this is a picture from
our museum other TV typewriter

236
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,160
on which was put together by on

237
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,860
gentlemen who lived in New Jersey
donated to us

238
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,030
but what was happening there is a a

239
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,799
growing arm desire of people

240
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,400
who worked in phnom worked in the in the
industry to start building their own

241
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,459
computers are sorry to see the
possibilities are starting to see

242
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,079
on that they could do this themselves
and New Jersey Philadelphia Delaware

243
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,620
arm was very much involved in that in
this at this time it wasn't just

244
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,370
California were Colorado tax

245
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,670
the rate you want you could charmer
church on

246
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,069
August 74 I believe the don't put me on
a month

247
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:49,240
our radio electronics magazine had this
cover article about

248
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,420
kit computer call the marquee
minicomputer you put yourself

249
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,429
and arm it was pretty powerful

250
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,790
but it was impossible to build for every
10 sold baby wonderful work

251
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,719
very different over the years as well
and was designed by many John Titus

252
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,030
who are me most was living writing
technology articles for magazines and he

253
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,900
still does that today

254
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,959
and it was the predecessor I popular
electronic magazine

255
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,900
the following year 75 said now we have
to compete again sis

256
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,780
our rival I discrete computer can meet
our own

257
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,189
skip ahead film I've got I gotta got a
picture the one

258
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:30,260
okay

259
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,110
after no nevermind

260
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,100
skip ahead to the other not that out
there

261
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,250
that's it that's what we're out well
that's a second out there

262
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,010
the first after 1975 up doll talk about
it the let's let's go back up your

263
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,780
little bit

264
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,959
alright so so people write file okay
they were just

265
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,260
they were just gonna build their own
computer I'm now they can actually buy

266
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,169
kit

267
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:58,370
and I was very exciting this kid came
out I've generally our region

268
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,160
and I'm so what started to happen was

269
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,600
group group started to coalesce and

270
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,549
people's like-minded people start a game
together so this hackerspace concept

271
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:10,679
isn't new

272
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,199
the real Homebrew Computer Club began to
form including

273
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,500
on the amateur computer group in New
Jersey everything

274
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,319
Tokyo anyone who ever ready computers to
rebook knows about the Homebrew Computer

275
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,380
Club means of a valley

276
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,089
backup all the press but as bill said it
was one in Central Jersey

277
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,069
it was basically Scotch Plains it still
is today base in Scotch Plains it was

278
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:33,939
the

279
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:37,699
they claim to be the all this running
you're not interrupted Computer Club

280
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:38,959
unrolled

281
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,640
I don't really know for sure not but I
don't see that I not true but that way

282
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,720
and on originally there are four in the
clubs like them reform just to help

283
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,579
people

284
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:52,780
build the case you can get instructions
you gots to max

285
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,110
are and you had a really really be a
serious side here just to even build

286
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,040
on once people start doing the tests
they said well what do we do with the

287
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,169
computers

288
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:05,869
in many cases even the people whom baby
out there amid the marquee

289
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,390
never sought do much arm

290
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,760
so for example in california over at the
figure out by accident how to play music

291
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,819
on health care

292
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,668
such as this one s I'm so this is this
is an exorcism

293
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,679
that example if a computer from that
time our military was not invented in

294
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,530
the mid-atlantic

295
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,510
I region but certainly this is actually
not the first one but does

296
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,120
the want to happen have a picture arm

297
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,690
and this is an example of the types of
interfaces you would would use the

298
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,370
computer you can see

299
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,480
on again people weren't really building
a computer to make a word processor to

300
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,610
make games analyst they're making a
computer to do computing

301
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,250
of some sort interface analog to digital
converters are

302
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,410
or whatnot so this computer you would I
ames

303
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,620
yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't believe
be able to play games or something like

304
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,960
this until you wrote the software which
there was none

305
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,120
yet so these groups for getting together
to say hey

306
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,820
now we need software now we need to have
a terminal now we need to figure out how

307
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,320
to connect this thing to a teletype and
so on

308
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,059
I'm when you bought an early computer
like this are you really had was a way

309
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:11,710
to

310
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,370
change manipulate data and put
instructions in the memory

311
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,480
arm and then execute

312
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,820
and you can see here this is a 76 876
successor to the original

313
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,320
and I you can see the specifications

314
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,100
on the first computer store on the east
coast was our computer mark

315
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,610
yeah I think in Long Island for now here
Manhattan you're here Manhattan

316
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,790
arm but they were too often the ginger
Zee within

317
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,290
you know within months after the New
York when opened up

318
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,730
arm computer my was a chain anyone
senators he knows

319
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,760
town is is when a neighborhood were
satcher

320
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,679
and ob/ob right left have a computer
works I haven't I found Larry Stein to

321
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,570
get him

322
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,220
I haven't been able to find mister act
yet but from what I'm told

323
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,150
it was not really computer store it was
kind of like a little wing of electronic

324
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,299
shop

325
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,450
I don't know I haven't I haven't found
him yet I'm trying everyone knows him

326
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,650
let me know speaking of which if if if
anyone has additional location or or

327
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,870
brochures or receipts or whatnot from
the computer purchase from

328
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,419
ninety 74 75 76 would be interested

329
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:24,020
yeah we're always looking for the
paraphernalia for for museum

330
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,168
okay this is this this is a a image have

331
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:32,919
the the a Southern California Computer
Society magazine

332
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,380
on and the reason I put this up is that

333
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,570
there was a Delaware Valley Chapter I'm
which was considered to be

334
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,850
the most vibrant an active I the

335
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,220
Computer Society's aside aside from the
one in Southern California

336
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,750
and as a quote there from creative
computing about

337
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,880
off by the president the fields I'm
describing how

338
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,000
this Philadelphia area really had a buzz
too especially

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,549
I personally am not familiar was going
on in the New York area

340
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,470
at the same time I was in that there was
also something happening but

341
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,730
specifically

342
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,000
in our mid-atlantic region of
Philadelphia was

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,980
perhaps more active than it is today
also just as an aside

344
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,419
on the more popular magazine forces by

345
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,900
a critical ping was actually out first
but was published up in new hampshire I

346
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,220
believe compare computing was published
in march down the jersey

347
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,160
by David all and Dom after this speech
come out or put on a mazy level

348
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,380
David all is present selling back issues
of his magazine

349
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,470
he's also selling CDs in 1978 computer

350
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,150
music festival you can meet him in
person

351
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,260
speaking festivals the I the very first
computer festival in the

352
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,379
United States was the New Jersey
computer Fest on this is an

353
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,950
advertisement from doctor dobbs Journal

354
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,630
I in now I'll may have

355
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,840
was it was for may have farm 1976 and I
think this came out in March

356
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,280
1976 there was no actual April
advertising a dissident have enough

357
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,910
money to advertise two months in a row
so disfigured well

358
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,040
he's on March good enough but this was
the

359
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,530
very first advertisement on the very
first computer festival in the United

360
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,050
States

361
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,899
again if you watch pirate to soften
valuing those corny movies

362
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,970
hear all about the West Coast computer
fair and again that was a famous one

363
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,570
arm but also New Jersey with within a
couple months was another show call PC

364
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,409
76 in Lake City

365
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,360
from by John docs: and arm

366
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,820
that was again that was more of a
commercial computer show where is

367
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,070
tradeshow became more for users show
over the years

368
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,389
and there were there were all the heavy
hitters rat the train computer festival

369
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,350
events com minutes him sigh Prosser
technologies

370
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,190
I'm a higher scientific on SWT PC
command code cetera

371
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm all of the if your computer
historian all of the

372
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,010
manufactures all the most %uh the very
first

373
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,170
Tom generation of homebrew

374
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,210
our computer enthusiasts who actually
said hey let's make a company

375
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,220
and that that little incubator all went
out to trend in

376
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,360
it was a bit was an opportunity for them
to to of

377
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,080
you know can get together some other im
I'm to meet each other for the first

378
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,870
time also urging tip is at 10 there
early keynote speakers

379
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,360
was john motley have any axe fame so
there's fifteen hundred people

380
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,740
and the other our first for the trunk
Peter festival that we know of at least

381
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,160
certainly in in the middle like
mid-atlantic region is the first flea

382
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,670
market

383
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,730
specific to compute

384
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,450
his next slide is about the Philadelphia
area Computer Society

385
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,730
another group is born on June 1976

386
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,960
I dick moe berg was the a president we
still around today but he's not

387
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,670
president

388
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:52,500
longer group I'm again this is a group
of people getting together not to

389
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,860
learn how to use Excel or or how do you
know

390
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,450
use CPM even this was again a group a
special interest but a church group

391
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,250
specific to a processor type: and can we
build our computer around the processor

392
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,890
there's also mom computers in education
which is very arm

393
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,340
very big at the time I'm giving students
access to

394
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,990
a time-sharing systems and one daughter
wasn't just microcomputers also

395
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,180
time-sharing systems

396
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,530
in schools minutes

397
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,180
top okay the teletype

398
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,800
was the hard storage device

399
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,920
the mid-seventies too late seventies and
talk a set I finally took over

400
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,730
it was a terminal it was a trainer was a
storage device

401
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,710
and it was a readout I'll device on
one's

402
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,420
on so in the days before there was discs

403
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,830
and cassettes and hard drives why not if
you have a computer

404
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,929
you had an Altera few nm sigh you also
had a teletype if you're going to save

405
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,720
your comp programs and you want to see
it as a screen

406
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,740
essentially so your screen was your
teletype

407
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,500
on we don't have a teletype on display
here but we certainly do have on our

408
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,350
museum

409
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,150
and I miniature favoring running but but
I certainly we have

410
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,100
number members who would have some like
this a definitive computer festival

411
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,330
so here's a here's an advertisement that
I found from Berkeley Heights New Jersey

412
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,889
from 76 77 is kinda give you an idea of
the expense

413
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,410
so you really have to want to do
computing I'm in 1976 the

414
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,510
equivalent dollars they turned forty
dollars

415
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,220
back then is a lot more she already
spent perhaps

416
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,340
on 809 thousand dollars just on the
parts you have the privilege of working

417
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,490
for six months to put a computer
together see good and pick up a teletype

418
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,500
to it

419
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,200
and I do in the garage was so loud I
couldn't certainly talk on the phone at

420
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,070
the same time

421
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,230
I'm group began are led by

422
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,600
fill up your computer society and others
to actually start to build their own

423
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,230
computer trainer so

424
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,450
this is a early computer are built by

425
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,650
the the pacs group single board computer

426
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,610
arm and it was actually feature in byte
magazine in this would have been an

427
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,410
example

428
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,960
love the typeof computer you've sent
away for

429
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,380
on as a kid I'm if you read byte
magazine in Avatar money

430
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,430
you can see there's very few chips on
the board but then once you once you're

431
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,210
done

432
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,480
then the fun begins because then you
have to figure out well how do i hook up

433
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,600
things to it so a lot of the

434
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,830
microcontrollers that you see today a
lot of the om

435
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,070
the hacking spaced typed work is being
done to microcontrollers

436
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:35,070
that same spirit was was associated with
these types a single board computers

437
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,260
you go okay maas technologies was the
6502

438
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,580
chipmaker I'm and they were based in arm

439
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,760
the Philadelphia region and they made

440
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,820
the truck pedal invented the 6502

441
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,010
processor this was the processor that
was used in Apple Computer there how

442
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,890
scientific

443
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,260
the Atari Ahmed of course it was the
computer that was part of the set

444
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,560
doctors said ship that you have created
music today so

445
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,740
on this is just an example bombing or
stand Pennsylvania

446
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,480
listen to Jersey ice okay Pennsylvania

447
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,750
um I does really an important

448
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,940
II manufacturers computing technology

449
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,330
and then Moss was acquired by Commodore
yes

450
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,699
yeah the early Commodores the pet and
whatnot were designs often valuable com

451
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,270
there was a Pennsylvania company

452
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:30,280
and today you don't really have
magazines dedicated to a specific

453
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,780
processor you know

454
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,250
you will go out and buy in a magazine
about the i seven or something so

455
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,600
there is there is a arm magazine called
micro

456
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,420
I'm dedicated to the 6502 processors
right away

457
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,620
although it wasn't the first
microprocessor

458
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,280
available for computer it became very
popular right away cuz it was cheap

459
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,129
and there's a lot of things you could do
with it that the ability to do tables

460
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,440
in Italy tables i'm for graphics for
example in a way that was really as

461
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,370
convenient

462
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,730
I'm compared with 6800 processor
delivered

463
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,300
I'm I you math oriented or the more

464
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,410
I on direct memory access ran it for a
device is so you're 6502

465
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,930
could be put into a cheaply could put
into a disk drive so you could

466
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,370
tell the disk drive to do something
while you continue with your workers and

467
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,190
where was it was like having a

468
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,270
on parallel processing I remember my
childhood having a whole day worth kid

469
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,370
on the street this year

470
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,620
I have an opportunity in a calmer and we
didn't know same chip inside

471
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,190
how we know and that was seen computer
you know who knows what could happen

472
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,680
does be made in France

473
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,780
but but microcomputer is the a is the
magazine

474
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,470
that would have had I'm tips and tricks

475
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,930
and code listings and you wouldn't have
you know and it's something into the DOS

476
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,760
prompt you would have entered things in
the memory and I would have told you how

477
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,330
to enter things in the memory or how to
create a monitor

478
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,669
which back then was the name of the
program that you use to access and

479
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,970
manipulate memory

480
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,710
here's a picture of the cover and you
can see the aim 65 the Super jolt

481
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,090
the jolt was the first 6502 computer

482
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,670
on Apple to camp and so on so does very
high tech graphic

483
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,120
ok okay I'm

484
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,530
this is this is our slide to describe
the fact that

485
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,960
okay you have your real hardcore
homebrew people that had did you have

486
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,800
microprocessors that we're just trying
to connect

487
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,180
connect computers I 9 computers just
parts to try to get something up on your

488
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,610
television screen

489
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,930
then kid started coming out and you have
your Altair

490
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:37,290
and then you start having computers like
I'm imus i 8080 and what not to wear is

491
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,230
actually

492
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,600
more less a Finnish computer in 1977

493
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,280
a shoot in the air I love the appliance
computer

494
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,270
and that's when you see your trs-80
model 1 your Apple to

495
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,960
and your pet came coming out with fam in
the case up at

496
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,030
are you have a computer with the screen
with good except where all built in I

497
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,200
have to do is turn on

498
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,300
it says ready and to somebody in
nineteen

499
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,580
74 that would have been like a miracle
so in a three-year span

500
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,139
you went from essentially parts and
components

501
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,090
and I'm solving using computing the
solve problems to a full boil

502
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,559
full-blown computer and a I then

503
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,980
a group started developing in these a
computer clubs to now say okay now I

504
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,670
wanna make a trs-80 clap

505
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,280
its as it as if a national in three
years you want from a steep our courses

506
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,990
carriage

507
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,950
to her nikki is driving

508
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,430
sex you have a some pictures some
interesting computers give you Norstar

509
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,150
horizon I with the Norstar system

510
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,240
too skinny it had it was a arms

511
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,650
it was a on early computer with wooden
sides to it which is kinda cool and a

512
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,140
it had it was one of the very first five
and a quarter inch to strive

513
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,600
got insist ship was a VAT yes

514
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,530
okay and is value on a roll

515
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,430
already I 9078 little bit late there's a
company called site and

516
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,080
arm I don't know if anyone's ever seen
onion but there's a there's a there's a

517
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,590
parody on this company called is Alexa

518
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,650
this group for two guys to were in a.m
were in a hour

519
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,070
a garage and as their compares our
company grew they had to get a smaller

520
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,790
garage

521
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,889
is the you know they got worse well
desitin was a it was a dollar I mean it

522
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,450
was a new jersey-based company

523
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,530
and the Act I was actually the computer
I'm name

524
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,780
arm and %uh this is an example the fact
that there are a lot of companies

525
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,600
starting to

526
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,300
pop-up all over and certainly in the New
Jersey Philadelphia and our area

527
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,160
there were companies as well we're
trying to take their stab at

528
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,940
at at making a computer in making a pic
to an adjuster

529
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,350
again aside a couple of the guys from
site /a on went on to do the US division

530
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,620
Epson and the jersey as well your so

531
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,290
you can so things are happening is a a
first music show

532
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,280
and I also have some statistics hear
about the size of the market of

533
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,100
computing

534
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,160
by 1978 on a hundred eighty thousand two
hundred fifty thousand computers in an

535
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,780
insult

536
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,420
so from zero to 1978 having that many

537
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,380
a quarter-million on apple claims to
have

538
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,260
a a large portion of that but you can
see that up to a hundred thousand

539
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,110
computers sold in 1978 whereby companies

540
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:24,190
arm a small companies and %uh companies
are basically put in parts together and

541
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,559
selling them locally

542
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,580
so still was on a consolidated corporate
thing

543
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,460
but you could see change is coming into
Gaza Sears picture for Apple to

544
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,130
destroys other destructive first became
available with the Apple on

545
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,679
1970

546
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,980
alright so 9079 the appliance computer
is now

547
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,870
I'm so predominant dead outnumbered the
I'm home brew

548
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,230
I'm hacker type computers and the group

549
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,250
%uh the the computer group reflected
this to the point that

550
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,090
on those original hackers were to start
to drop out not even attend the meetings

551
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,330
anymore

552
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,870
you can also see I in this on

553
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,730
the sliders picture code listing back
then when you would buy a magazine

554
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,170
with your computer you would actually
very often open right up to the

555
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,030
centerfold

556
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,620
which was the code that you can actually
type in your computer

557
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,400
money was tight back San it are spent an
awful lot of money on a computer

558
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,000
and to get a free computer programs even
though you have to sit there and type it

559
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,980
in for five hours and you had to

560
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,550
saving on a cassette that would take
twenty five twenty minutes to save

561
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,428
and then realize it was bad and you may
want a boy in the whole thing will blow

562
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:35,200
up

563
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,150
arm and yet everyone durka Saturday put
another kiss settings are afraid that

564
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,740
that you said we have the old code in it
because you

565
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,920
packed theater the cassette come program
standard to

566
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,670
you were quite sure who was working as
you're kinda writing all the stuff at

567
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,750
the same time

568
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,400
you could see why you have special
interest groups have people is getting

569
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,059
together and frustration just to share
tapes are share paper taped

570
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,059
because not everybody had the ability to
'em

571
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:03,379
answering programs in the into memory so
when basic

572
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,520
with computers got powerful enough and
had 4k and even 8k on and you can

573
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,700
actually type in a basic listing

574
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,800
an hour talking so this is an example
other basic listing avail

575
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,530
on elisa which is a computer program is
a go

576
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,690
Marcus psychiatrists emulator

577
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,840
that that I actually I worked on myself
and me

578
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,150
you know take to myself into the
experience which I encourage everyone to

579
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,000
do

580
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,420
arm and the the evolution computer ever
evolving now you can actually a computer

581
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,990
with basic and actually

582
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,150
you know not have to know everything
about the inside

583
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,880
the computers that d the circle love
types of computer of people are actually

584
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,130
using computers is growing so you have
your

585
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,530
engineers and your technologist your
technology people

586
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,580
injure programmers who who

587
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,120
you know were so dedicated they're
willing to learn and do stuff on their

588
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,370
own and now we're seeing things

589
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,730
appear in department stores re actually
it is by computer

590
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,220
and plug it in turn and a and use it

591
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,710
I'm further the first electronic
bulletin boards

592
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,359
arm was called

593
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,279
CVBs were Christians in this is at a
Chicago believe me there was also born

594
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,919
boards

595
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,969
in our area and are you can see is
another milestone CPM becomes the

596
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,559
dominant operating system for small
business

597
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,220
on his account is introduced for the
Apple to and then Texas Instruments

598
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,059
atari commodore Sinclair and other
manufacturers

599
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:34,450
offer more computers and so they sell
them in the purpose was a sad for some

600
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,319
pictures of some others computers

601
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:40,779
you could see these are computers that
were not intended to be open

602
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,169
they're not intended to be hacked they
were not intended to be messed with

603
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,719
these were computers are the key word
Ando people more interest in playing

604
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,849
games with them really were using
business applications

605
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:54,020
and they just wanted them to work and
CPM

606
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,869
was the first operating system those
reliable that will enable you to take a

607
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,589
disc

608
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:01,960
and phiri or at least transport by modem

609
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,369
inferior program from one place to
another and still be readable

610
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:10,480
and that's where and were Christian sons
BBS

611
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,099
became popular as this ability to use to
and copy CPM programs

612
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:19,040
as always this this invented open that
door open that door open that door and

613
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,109
CPM is a very important

614
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,480
step in the evolution of computing not
just in the middle and it but everywhere

615
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,839
because that ability to share files now
we're talking diskettes now we're

616
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,009
talking about

617
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:35,359
the ability to saving and IMAX theater
in a lot different faster ways

618
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,259
here's a listing I'm from Fido net that
I extracted

619
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:44,470
from from our basic area to show you all
the bulletin boards that were available

620
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,140
I'm at the time for the the world I
webber's available you would

621
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,390
find the number that was in your area
and you would call it with your

622
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,970
your modem and you woulda axis whatever
files happened to be there

623
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,380
I'm not gonna talk this early to fight
on and detail but

624
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,119
fighter net is one component of the
bulletin board system many of these

625
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,980
bored bored specially beginning was a
one-off

626
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,339
had a computer club and I'm he did make
the meetings

627
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:14,099
that week you could dial into that clubs
bulletin board and download the meeting

628
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,059
minutes

629
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:18,900
if text files and whatnot we're talking
300 baud

630
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,740
talking about you know very slow
computers but at least you could

631
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,240
actually magically transfer files from
one place to another and

632
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,990
I personally remember the thrill of just
getting my computer to work

633
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,990
getting it actually dial connect to
somebody else's computer and I know that

634
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,530
they were

635
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,690
on the other end is watching the modem
lights and everything flashing is a

636
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,849
search citing

637
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:43,930
that was almost the game if it wasn't
actually the file

638
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:48,210
it was that process setup does little to
me he remembers a thrill

639
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,990
I remember the agony in my mom getting
the phone bill it

640
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,079
and naturally on the phone and that's
when a lot of people my age began to do

641
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,480
real hacking because now right okay how
we gonna get to the California

642
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,130
where they're paying for it and that
really

643
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,160
and that's part of why aren't we getting
histories illustrate that it wasn't just

644
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,770
like you woke up one morning in

645
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,349
the computer was sitting on your desk in
a distorted why the communique was

646
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:13,510
something California

647
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,780
to get the cool files that you know
somebody the Atari

648
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,849
a.m. Todd company you know was putting
out or whatever

649
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:24,160
it was it was the whole concept ive you
couldn't afford it but you really want

650
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,770
to do it

651
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,390
and and once you get that first phone
bill and you know that was trying to

652
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,098
figure something out

653
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:34,700
I am putting in a pitch for Delaware
which is my my home

654
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,270
I'm which doesn't really do much I'm
actually key to the river I teach

655
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,980
computers through the University dollar

656
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,589
I'm but there was actually a lot of
things going on I'm at the time somewhat

657
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:48,009
I'm there is a computer company called
actually I'm making

658
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,109
missus excuse there was a fitting of I'm
there's a company called computer data

659
00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,180
systems which is the only computer
company like if I for the 1970s

660
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,100
I'm there's project delta which was a
organization for the University dollar

661
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,670
which is pretty much the only

662
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,750
I academic group

663
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,850
pushing computing that I know of at the
time where they would actually put

664
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,509
computers in schools for students and
whatnot

665
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,840
the PLATO system was heavily used in
dollar was invented in dollar bills

666
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,670
heavily is intolerance seventies

667
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,780
but really them the the most important

668
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,740
component of the Delaware area to
computing wasn't the homebrew

669
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,119
wasn't really think it was the fact
dupont and IBM

670
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,240
were so rich and so large that they
bought

671
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,950
every computer that came out and gave it
to every that was

672
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,990
that was the company where people first
forgetting

673
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,330
everybody was getting a computer on
their desk I used to work at IBM and I

674
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,420
remember

675
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,840
arm the the tractor-trailer would pull
up

676
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,000
and stayed open it up in it start
unloading computers in the guy would say

677
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,230
what would you have

678
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,830
today so is it was something like that
lol to the dupont is it really

679
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,600
interesting because

680
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,420
IBM speak for itself right arm Japon

681
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,840
goes back really far computer history in
friend people notice

682
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,970
in the late mid to late fifties

683
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,960
engineers were starting to come up with
scheduling Perkins CPM

684
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,470
not the operating system cost per minute
things like that

685
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,970
and john motley getting eniac fame arm

686
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,670
had a couple startups mostly
unsuccessful after an act

687
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,619
any had one column of the associates
which was a software consulting Cup in

688
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,400
late 50's early 60's

689
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,170
and he was trying to do basically
business you know scheduling software

690
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,540
consulting

691
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,350
and many apps engineers came out the
part arm

692
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:42,069
and they actually built a portable
suitcase sized had a la computer

693
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,400
pretty much the same size and Osborn
seventeen years before the Osborne

694
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,500
up and I was done by Motley and biologic
point engineers

695
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,490
in Philadelphia area and other a lot
ASRock you got

696
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,960
this is a this is a picture of the com

697
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,109
the diagnostic panel hi in early and
assess net

698
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:04,119
on thats was developed in the received
over this was the

699
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:07,530
arm your seed over got a contract to
make the fuzzball which was the first

700
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,490
router that was used in SF net and a

701
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,800
on we're running out on so does go
through as quickly and assess net was

702
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,330
the

703
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,480
second generation of the internet's you
ARPANET and then when Milner

704
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,480
I'm broke off have ARPANET SF that was
def

705
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,160
was the thing that formed around it and
on

706
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,270
the the connection in the mid-atlantic
area was does was

707
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,119
princeton 56k modems from PDP

708
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,180
curtains and this was comin exciting
things for people I know at the

709
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,350
University dollar but also

710
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:46,839
obviously a prince okay we're like I
said we've got fifty minutes and

711
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,850
I cigarette right answers a question
you're so we're just gonna go rapid-fire

712
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,109
to show you guys some

713
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:55,020
other computers army in the area some of
them are more stroppy something that

714
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,990
other stuff and we're just kinda there

715
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,180
but they're all cool so he's gonna show
you a bunch I've got a number of

716
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,910
inquiries about the AT&T

717
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm 6302 because I've the AT&T

718
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,090
on 31 we've got on display downstairs
nears picture of it from my basement

719
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,109
this is the RCA cosmic Microcat one on
this is a really cool computer on this

720
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:15,810
is

721
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:20,330
this is before the Altair and it was a
microcomputer before the Altair

722
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,799
and it ran on the arm I

723
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,070
the that version of the chip the
eventually became a cosmic

724
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,220
elf so this was the data a preview
version are seeking shooting was done in

725
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,830
summer on the jersey in Camden New
Jersey

726
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,150
franklin et ses a clone of the Apple to
this was done

727
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,410
and Medford you know his or her
somewhere in

728
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,529
has Pennsauken wei-wei South Jersey
captured by the way real

729
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:49,000
the two engineers who designed this
computer are members of our club today

730
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,089
not the sexual one come up a counter 64
obviously

731
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:58,359
a Norristown Pennsylvania and I
westchester pennsylvania which is all

732
00:41:58,359 --> 00:41:59,788
about 20 miles from my house

733
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:04,329
and you can see here between 10 the 17
million if these were sold

734
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,680
right outta for the mid-atlantic region
and the Commerce City for was a beso Inc

735
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,450
actually is the best selling individual
on a computer all times I'll today

736
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,579
you not counting clones skip this one

737
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,890
just some statistics purpose PC is this
is a

738
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,288
business computer the pair 8032 the

739
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:29,410
portable computing has a high some
origins in the AM in a leg region

740
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,180
including yepsen HX 20 which was
developed by

741
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,520
in New Jersey year there was also there
were in et2

742
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,009
half a dozen companies kinda
spontaneously in betar laptops

743
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,079
another one local area up was called
telegram

744
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,089
up in Westchester County New York this
is a very early work laptop look like

745
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:52,150
1981 82 81 that's wrong

746
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,619
okay we'll talk later

747
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,770
ok I'm years Casio this is another
company

748
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,910
base in New Jersey against yup North
Jersey in you know

749
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,240
did these were developed in Japan at
this point but they're all

750
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,119
mark you know these were new jersey
companies how many computer companies

751
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:11,609
are now based in New Jersey

752
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:15,288
now ago

753
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:18,619
obvious computing today are there some

754
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:22,700
resources for you you can write those
down

755
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,109
for look at them and memorize this is an
example love the vintage computer

756
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:28,089
festival that

757
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:32,170
we held a few years ago in wall New
Jersey which isn't were info age is

758
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:32,890
located

759
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:36,400
and this is like our cover home base for
middle and greater computing

760
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,640
obvious club yet but I'll a real real
short commercial blog

761
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,970
are the next vintage the BCF a star on
the west coast while we do his VCF

762
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,289
East and the next one will be May 14-15

763
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:51,240
next year at our museum on the Jersey
for this computer festival East

764
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,539
seven does euro

765
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:58,799
K our club for in 2005 there's the
website address mid-atlantic

766
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:02,288
Richard at work that's a good picture of
the PDP

767
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:07,010
that we spoke about earlier with the
resistors and

768
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,470
I also want to put a plug in for the
delaware hackerspace on

769
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,480
on August 26 were having a a PBA

770
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,069
PDP 11 hacking weekend if you're in a
dour area in your interest in working

771
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:18,109
vintage computing

772
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:21,190
I'm hardware stuff you know actually
working on them

773
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,859
that's what that's going to be the loose
topic although i certainly would welcome

774
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:25,339
any

775
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:29,828
on any vintage computing if you're
interested on to see me afterwards or

776
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:34,210
or go to vintage pewter dotnet so we
hope you have time for

777
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:39,670
34 questions work because of a stage I
can't see anything

778
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,890
so I don't know how many us to Sheila
yell

779
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,049
a request I'm

780
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:51,250
how old would you consider vintage unit
work status before their vintage like

781
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:51,930
what you sick

782
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,160
vigil sparks keep vintage still okay

783
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,899
definition a vintage is of an era so

784
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,690
there you go okay cool however all and
that as it we used to say

785
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,940
the 10-year rule we stop saying that
exactly mean windows 98

786
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,390
on right on

787
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,578
as a real general rule of thumb our
hobby

788
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:21,839
pretty much cuts off at 186 with some
exceptions Amiga next

789
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,390
nude in et cetera but rule of thumb if
it's a too easy for newer if it runs any

790
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,720
version dos northern Italian 4.2 X

791
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,619
it to use computer nada it's like an
antique are verses

792
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:36,760
a used car 75% sure your sis 57 Chevy
you know we see it you know

793
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,170
Jenna 77 Villari not too cool to have a
77 Thunderbird more cool

794
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:44,430
could be vintage earning so it depends
on the on

795
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,109
is this historically significant is
probably gonna be historically

796
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:48,940
significant

797
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,270
so if you have the offer spark station
then yes if you have a %uh the fourth

798
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,079
version now

799
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:58,480
and and frankly I don't really care I
like all computers

800
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,029
so if you know if personally I don't
really care but I mean tradition with

801
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:02,869
obvious is

802
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:07,750
sternest coalesce around seventy eighty
87-88 seems to be the car none of us are

803
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,390
saying that

804
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,500
the computers are better than new ones
but their character

805
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,190
you never want cars at Finns me didn't
do anything

806
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,289
but they had character and today I can't
fathom

807
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:21,990
that in 30 years anyone to collective 87
Ford Taurus

808
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,339
but the Michael act you know in 1996
viper

809
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:29,480
right cut things character might still
be interesting to us okay next question

810
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,400
just a quick observation that
downloading a file text whatever at 300

811
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:41,349
baht you would get 16k in about 10
minutes

812
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:46,130
I was gonna say that I i remember typing
into my Commodore vic-20 for hours

813
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,160
to create hangman and then

814
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,799
another few hours on my question though
or thought

815
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:56,210
was I had this hopped up to a
black-and-white TV

816
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:01,710
and I've always wondered for years now
why did we have to create monitors

817
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,270
you know what what was wrong when
hooking it up to a a TV set

818
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:09,029
and now it seems to be finally going in
the other direction we can now you know

819
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:13,509
connect with your plasma let's refresh
rate now that

820
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:18,799
I mean has to do with a your and and the
resolution

821
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:22,460
speaking to the programs really quick we
go downstairs we have adventure set up

822
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,940
on the on the UNIX PC if anyone wants to
play when others I'll text games

823
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,289
a couple others too be a couple things
are number one

824
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:32,819
arm what people don't know this but the
world's first 32-bit microprocessor

825
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,130
originated here in New Jersey

826
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,349
the bill Mack PW for 2000

827
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:41,539
well thank you for joining our call yeah
I'd like to know why another tidbit

828
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:46,309
so for you when you refer to CBS sorry
tough actually refer to as warden

829
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:51,190
randy's yeah all awarded the softer
reeves is to the hardware

830
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,770
by the way I want co-ops about board
I'll years back

831
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:58,299
are and %uh the 6300 you posted in all
that

832
00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:02,880
is not really AT&T it was built by
olivetti it was an m20 and rebranded by

833
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,599
AT&T

834
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,230
and many other questions why I actually
you are right

835
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,380
arms we will remember that the next time
it is present

836
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,740
the really that's a very good point I
didn't think about that we discussed

837
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,730
focusing on AT&T and not the fact that
you're actually right that's true

838
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:23,009
also I used to work with older fear we
also know the Keno

839
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:27,069
living I dropped genocide coming up soon
so

840
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:30,579
okay okay so how much more time do we
have left I think

841
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:36,009
six minutes aka I just very briefly a
nurse was the computers you mentioned

842
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:40,150
are also listed a lot in the book
computer led by Ted Nelson

843
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,299
that's a really good resource in I
really love reviews from New Jersey by

844
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:44,579
the way

845
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:48,140
he seems like he's from everywhere EE
who drowned a lot of

846
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:53,400
mother is the actress Celeste Holm

847
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,539
judges really good grief they they
reprinted in eighty seven and get a copy

848
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:57,279
the reprint

849
00:48:57,279 --> 00:49:02,960
it's a lot of fun to read yeah I love it
too I I to feel like that

850
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,009
a notice on the %ah BBS forms listed
that one was called on Soros

851
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:13,970
was delete the first card informercial

852
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:18,950
dumps R Us year if you know well I after
that I have been every single arm

853
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,319
BBS on earth but I am yeah that one

854
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,609
like what was which one is it what
number the

855
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:28,859
2001 85 some 40 for the other is from

856
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:32,069
your mom's yeah that's really you know
don't or

857
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:36,440
Tuesday would recognize any of these
anne-marie by some CVV users

858
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,900
Jetstar was file-sharing file-sharing go
get her

859
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,930
not you could be core dumps it could be
anything call kitchen

860
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,549
bumps

861
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:52,609
so that was a great thing about but

862
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:59,558
for the pictures were asking art

863
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:03,069
for anybody else I will if you have a

864
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:07,520
could all computer that you have rescued
CS maybe we could come out drive out get

865
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:07,829
it

866
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:11,900
arm we are certainly that's part of our
charter is to save and preserve these

867
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,720
computers actually fix them and get them
up and running

868
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,020
that's our thing and I

869
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,290
I guess we're done the end

870
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:27,950
%ah

871
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,259
good job
