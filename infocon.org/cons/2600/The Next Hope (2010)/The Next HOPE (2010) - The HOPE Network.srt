1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,088
when arm I guarantee we will not fill
the whole hour but the V-twenty time for

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:05,029
Q&A at the end

3
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:09,200
%uh so here's

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,290
I'm about three quarters the networking
came arm

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,840
I let everybody themselves in a moment
but a but people think that's in the

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,330
work

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:23,109
for are

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:27,260
as I love right now I believe it's the
first time we've ever not had a major

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,859
network failure during the con

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,480
so for and a

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,950
other people introduce themselves and
we'll get started so I'm my car driver

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,530
Noah

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,160
and WiFi stuff and overall you know
wrangling

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,629
network stuff I am bill on the network
manager adultery or 11

15
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,039
more than a few devices here on Nick
binary

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,969
Nov 15 years experience with internet
pumps I'm centered

17
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,140
general UNIX me and again i'm fred

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,770
drugs in the queue here and take some
photos I'm porch up

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,429
hear that some the wiring and otherwise
I might never come in Madrid

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,950
and also holding back tears Cairo

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,090
wrangled wave more stand-up

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,470
stand-up embarrass you he's the man
franklin et al.

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,150
the Santa Claus hearing go to all the
dishes the uplink

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,040
the band with the IP space so you know
the fiber it wouldn't work without him

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,520
so I'll

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,220
alright alright

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,439
%uh basically this year we have over 50
megabit up when can act on it

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,970
this is a pitcher the antenna the dish
on the roof

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,420
it points to time square on anymore
pacific Sunwear

30
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,960
whose office opposed to raymond Anderson

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,369
yes it's all going to Rainbow as the
other provider which is also the

32
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,369
provider that the hotel uses for there
are commercial internet service

33
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,679
arm and they did a great job getting us

34
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,650
a link from a hotel that doesn't have a
lot of a point capability so

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,110
anybody remembers you know six years ago
overlooking a DSL lines

36
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,540
and %uh a megabit and now we have 50

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,799
shot across Manhattan its prequel

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,459
is pretty stable on the harbour

39
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,180
the network this year consisted of the
core 6509 Wilson two's

40
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,050
says you give it and copper line cards
in there the edge consisted of buses

41
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,440
Cove

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,349
3515 3516 purely switches and the
wireless age is 18 Aruba

43
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,260
87 the access points as a pitcher

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,230
servings that helps call the switch down
as it's vital for

45
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,940
yes for the next on

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,140
a packet filtering was Donna pics 535

47
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,170
and services provided with BST jails run
in a few BST

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,909
its picture the river access control yet
so everybody's life I traffic went

49
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,739
through that one wire to the one little
box

50
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,440
was a simple fact pitcher than ever
architecture

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,170
basically we have far 59 but when coming
into a switcher on the eighteenth floor

52
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,860
another switch located under the stage
13 access points are strapped to the

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,450
various peoples around here

54
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,330
and then we have multi-mode fiber run it
goes from 18th floor down in the second

55
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,330
to the stairwell

56
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,810
on hotel really didn't have any
infrastructure to do

57
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,040
anything else on there wasn't any risers
or anything like that with a runner on

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,940
other are risers in the hotel
unfortunately they are on the other side

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,049
of the elevators were thirties walking
accessible risers for us

60
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,440
so we could I have everybody welcome a
network cable break it cuz theres

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
you know 2,000 people walking over ten
times a day or we could run it on

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,609
stairwell it

63
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,720
so the car than ever unit consisted of
the 6509

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,409
on is a the X 535 various view and a
truck between it

65
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,150
on edge switches on the second floor
with no colour cage

66
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,769
which to mezzanine switches that
attracted to the various data jacks

67
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,790
on the second floor there if the 587 AP
seventies deployed

68
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,790
MD project a dedicated switch and
there's a controller

69
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,009
are also up on the eighteenth floor
people might may have noticed or not

70
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,350
arm we we learned in previous years ever
gonna run cables every AP up here we're

71
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,060
looking at about 8,000 feet

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,290
cat-5 are so what we're actually running
is %uh

73
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,199
dual channel 5 gigahertz mash so the
AP's on the polls in the back

74
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,280
act as a mess controllers that pipe to
one of the AP's suck balls here

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,490
but then tunnel the other AP's back in
if they're plugged into Ethernet

76
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,509
it's pretty cool so yeah

77
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:45,940
we saved on a couple hours worth the
effort and a couple hundred bucks for

78
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,699
the cabling

79
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:50,580
largest bank in the head by the way
getting

80
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,650
he's being as the person who got told to
do the cable in

81
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,860
break so here's a

82
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,100
basic breakdown of the IP location
services

83
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,630
we had quite a few more viewers than we
had in the past hope

84
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,870
discusses the various services in
different access levels are people

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,070
required

86
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,509
on everything I love the wifi except for
the public networks was paid to this

87
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,590
X 535 on which had

88
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,320
not when it faces and what will you
answer some questions any Cisco

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,979
employees in the audience right now

90
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,680
no okay just wondering so one of the
reasons for these interfaces I found

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,340
this really interesting

92
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,720
issue where if you go and span the same
feel into multiple contacts

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,220
the fire all the stops processing are
and so I figure that out

94
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,810
around 4:30 in the morning on Wednesday

95
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,900
not a really good time to figure that
out so it's got around that by just

96
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,479
basically attention more physical
interfaces to the fire

97
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,960
so far lots of is carved up and 23 three
different contexts here

98
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,758
on admin that's completely isolated from
ever any other user traffic

99
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,319
on heard the data plan other just so you
know higher security there's only one IP

100
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,210
letter

101
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,810
manages from there was another context
on there just for admin traffic

102
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,210
and the rest were the very experienced
to BPA

103
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,330
and the open in a wired on network

104
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,990
services are deployed through FreeBSD
deals with five been running

105
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,449
bind DNS I see the HP a syslog service

106
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:24,449
MRTG and a netbook workers in in time

107
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,110
we have some stats on the wifi side
everything ran for the RBA controller

108
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,640
and then a all the WPA stuff was
terminated on the year before as well

109
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,270
using a %ah an internal user

110
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,520
%uh you can you can do it externally
whether

111
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,530
up love RADIUS server and and dedicated
user accounts but

112
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,920
I you know cared a lot of his gear down
love it got shut down

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,080
in a in a car so we we want to get
creamer here

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,820
and I'm just talking we're all reading
that fluctuates a lot funnier

115
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,810
rights never stats

116
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,810
on we showed our round 1200 unique maxi
dresses that were handed out by the HP

117
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,390
server

118
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:13,030
around 100 2200 season arm around 220
million flows throughout the weekend to

119
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,090
the netbook liquor

120
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,720
02 mesh networks is try to explain for
the 18th floor

121
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,660
on also on the wifi we normally saw
about a

122
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,760
about 200 people on at any given time
are so about 10 percent

123
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,940
everybody here is using the the wifi at
any given point

124
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,020
%uh but there are some no obvious
significant peaks and valleys throughout

125
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,770
the day for that

126
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,840
you don't talk about the there so %ah
her running idea stuff on the wifi the

127
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,520
whole time

128
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,609
%uh we saw about 50 a piece moving
attacks

129
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,240
which is no alright big deal good work
guys up

130
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,940
about 10 DoS attack some Thai people
finally figured out that it's kinda

131
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,180
boring to do that so

132
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,950
just annoying yeah also we had so many
AP's up that'd be pretty hard for you to

133
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,430
take them all at once and thats

134
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,040
really not a challenge to go ahead got
an hour left yeah I think the load on

135
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,000
the 6500 up 32 percent max throughout
the weekend so

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,140
other about our twenty non ho babies
that were plugged into the network

137
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,099
somewhere

138
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,680
up mainly that means Rd a system set up
to probe the cup replicated out the man

139
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,940
went

140
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,469
well your plugin or network somewhere
arm so

141
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,390
alright people did that does have an
interest in number and the most

142
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,950
interesting number is others 198 please
R&R summer overlapping with us right now

143
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:31,670
so hurray for new york city but we had
enough power to

144
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:37,669
drown them out pretty effectively other
shows the ballot use the

145
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,079
over 24-hour period on much winning
really go over

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,550
we had forty men over 40 megabits for
the speed test once and

147
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,089
as about it up I think we're pretty much
getting the other packets per second

148
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:49,900
woman

149
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,510
on the link by more than her hitting the
bandwidth limit just cuz a know we're

150
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,589
seeing you know 4,000 5,000

151
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,680
8 housing packet second just traffic
hammering out

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,720
and this graph shows the overall

153
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,050
throughput the network and its host
talking amongst themselves so we headed

154
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,660
when a massive 29 48 mega bits really
interesting stuff

155
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,800
for some more points lights traffic
distribution protocol if anybody cares

156
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,520
if she pees you know down the protocol
followed by

157
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,180
much when those boxes speaking about us
and

158
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,070
ok as those on the intro on the external
acres in prison break out as if BP is

159
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,610
number one by factor about

160
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,480
15 RHPS came right after that SSH came
in third for the outbound traffic that

161
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,390
was kinda nice to see

162
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,550
unfortunate the fourth out on traffic
with pop 3 really

163
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,960
really people puffery not pop 3s

164
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,360
mind you pop 3 yeah are we also saw

165
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,250
telnet come in a row number ten yeah for

166
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,920
I really soon people are like tunneling
something over that but I didn't bother

167
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,920
to look but yeah I think we're coming
stupid overcome it pretty re:

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,150
but also the amount by map again I'm at
this just the time ap

169
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,510
should be their talking about addition
he was

170
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,680
some I'm another significant hop pop s
and I'm at best but

171
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,900
does not as funny as the fact that there
is also significant

172
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,970
on Krypton rate

173
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,160
and which

174
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,010
so we made a little video that was a

175
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:37,010
15 minutes love the the network so this
is %uh packet a medic dumping all the

176
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
images are going over unencrypted HTTP
for

177
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,920
for about 15 minutes little the day
yesterday that's what this

178
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,099
that's exactly what we said

179
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,339
where's the morn that there's a couple
crutches that flash by

180
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,650
for you vote no

181
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,860
you hope here

182
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,900
so that was about you know

183
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,680
gonna have images that went by re:

184
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,280
so we didn't counter wants you to look
at that was before the concert

185
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,760
started and that made us realize a few
things up

186
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:29,760
pessimism is the new optimism

187
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,810
so

188
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,070
the first thing we have to do is run
that riser five her from the team for

189
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,110
the second floor

190
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,170
and we ended up by using a new fiber
last year

191
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,250
which was just i duplex Jack did not
emerge to really really on patch cable

192
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,180
and I'm assuming that the club had some
weight on it when the strands broke so

193
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,910
it's been a while trying to troubleshoot
that

194
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,900
on couldn't get it to work said to go to
a backup fiber which unfortunately

195
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,920
wasn't long enough and really wasn't
terminated very well

196
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,719
so arm ended up at this

197
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,340
and that's a banister xscape to and
that's pretty much what the entire

198
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,800
network is running through all weekend

199
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,080
well we hoped and prayed that nobody
bumped into it

200
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,080
determination is really but it works

201
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:28,810
and that's it for the slides 15 minutes
it's pretty good

202
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,130
any questions %uh diabaly

203
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,850
our microphones on in the middle okay
yeah a very big guns are on in the

204
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,770
middle so if you have questions q1 up

205
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,850
a.m. known for minister we don't have a
photo for the next ft backing the router

206
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,980
for anybody who was a

207
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,770
no hoping to see that for yet renders
offering to run downstairs and and and

208
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,520
get a picture taken for sputter

209
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,120
a suck up one man's in the network
traffic did you shake Nutella its entry

210
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
into oblivion

211
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,080
or to you had like some other one oh we
handled it with our

212
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,380
from there there's a big pipe and a

213
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,500
it's a hacker con so whatever yeah

214
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,320
me be it's just there wasn't any
filtering

215
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,460
protocols actually a at filtered

216
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,640
bias and down just reports can well

217
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,770
but I was off the porch of actually did
bring a package here and then we went

218
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,990
wow it's four in the morning care too
much

219
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,010
does it was necessary anyway I think
we're gonna do is your

220
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,400
make it so that everybody uniquely
except for the speakers are you get a

221
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,480
little bit a priority for

222
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,480
but that was all wherever planning on
doing with another

223
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,930
shakedown any here but as it turns out
you know

224
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,710
hit the max at any point so we had a
plan but

225
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,890
wasn't needed never let you know if they
were able to get a big enough like that

226
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,439
we didn't have to worry too much about
problem arm

227
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,490
any throttling that went on was most
likely caused by people die from the

228
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,310
white fire just packets per second

229
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,650
so high that the the uplink starter
little bit or something like that

230
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,680
%uh one other problem we did see Fig a
provision was

231
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,250
apparently OS X doesn't like to be paid
to all that

232
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,830
well cuz or watch people can complain to
nine

233
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:19,290
had kinda said I have a Mac a pic

234
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,020
he says Windows seven do more shit as
Mac drivers windows 7 either

235
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,180
I my networks good

236
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,620
minded

237
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,060
after setting it up that I just had to
use

238
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,160
stop the wireless turn it back on and
then

239
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,160
then found a certificated you're able to
import so a

240
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,150
all I do is run TCP down to try diagnose
the problem and a

241
00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:01,040
it just works segmented enter okay one
question that arose during the first

242
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,380
part of this conference

243
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,110
why did you only have legacy I P the
four times that I've real internet

244
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,200
here are so where you from

245
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,420
from German and where we're at your

246
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:21,420
for on

247
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,080
eventually would be nice abut on the
really just isn't

248
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,450
the demands to deploy v6 nor Joan

249
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,250
be able to get an allocation for that on
so if you with the effort that it takes

250
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,930
to get what we have today

251
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,630
are up and running in it could be six on
top of that on

252
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,570
the number people over probably utilize
it would be pretty low sure it's fun to

253
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,520
play with but

254
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,530
on if not us Google start using it

255
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,550
are you volunteering for for

256
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,170
if you ask me in the next open the
whatever scored possibly

257
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,670
but I wouldn't think it would be good
even if its stomach but just to provide

258
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,470
for people in their argument

259
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,820
on German confronted with doing it for
the last year's and of course

260
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,040
not everybody knew that but it's Justin
a good option to tell people you try it

261
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,490
out

262
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,550
the future share as a point of reference

263
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,920
arm not the last men are meeting but the
meeting before that Dearborn Michigan

264
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,699
the ipv6 tough ended up being a total of
2 percent or so

265
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:20,060
up the outbound traffic was for the
North American network operator

266
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,110
the people who would probably be using
the sixth most the people who have it at

267
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,530
their corporate offices and stuff

268
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,650
and yeah for that the great but yet
you're talking about a

269
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,079
for meaning by time yeah I mean I think
the six is fantastic

270
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,339
for but play with a botch but the
allocation were given for this weekend

271
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:37,589
to

272
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,850
was just so big that other than just
people playing with it

273
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,880
over there was much needed you can
always is set up you know

274
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,510
four to six Tomo yourself laptop
naturally greatest prevent automatic

275
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,600
on such a good people want that there
would be six they're just set up their

276
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,350
own

277
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,290
little you know later told

278
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,740
faith are you guys for school %uh thank
you it was really they said

279
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,160
come here and have it at that worry I
think in person

280
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,839
are

281
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,470
my texts were sent me for dancers walked
and I have no problem with DHCP and

282
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,610
owning the day

283
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,020
are there any attempts for exhaustion
already

284
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,939
you know you things that you guys saw
did you plan for

285
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,410
people who do use DHCP exhaustion or
anything like that and

286
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,020
follow-up which actually has nothing to
do with it I was a deal with that happen

287
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,240
JavaScript to on bad start hope that

288
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,060
were you looking for nah I don't know
what the best people for their

289
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,690
yeah we are just a weird replied arm

290
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,080
and for just a common care okay that

291
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,379
governor I'm sorry I cannot let me know
that I had a job

292
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,200
kinda are but says I I don't know

293
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,460
I don't know we'll just do what they're
setting up so up

294
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,500
I don't know I think the program have a
talk during closing ceremonies or maybe

295
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,020
sometimes

296
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,179
questions for them then home so they
could probably tell you that

297
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:07,770
I think it was an attempt to look at
your browser history for more CSS hacks

298
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,910
to our

299
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,160
this bill profiles of people but yeah

300
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,179
but it will be noticed sour under

301
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,580
have a bf first question that might
answer question on

302
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,189
as playing at a point each piece moving
on from the switches and I just didn't

303
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,480
see anybody doing anything on it which
is great

304
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,660
on you know I wondered if you could
expected because we would have liked to

305
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,400
play with it but I did not a little this
work want it up doing was

306
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,580
you notice on the open and it'll begin
assigned flash twenty-two's

307
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,090
as well as the public are and that's
what I said

308
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,668
really really lovely studies on the DHCP
server the only issue the issue

309
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,770
I did notice is on the nasty cheap
implementation

310
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,570
sometimes we get unhappy if you switch
networks on

311
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,918
somewhat quickly on

312
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,400
it would have issues on the ATP server
would send an act that it's a nice on

313
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,350
the site PNC

314
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,730
you can have it just keep going I really
want and images go through that

315
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,600
iteration

316
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,660
five or six times and finally on get it
but

317
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,090
we do have a couple plans you know if we
did see something theirs and that his

318
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,159
hands on the river a key controller to

319
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,330
on controlled the cheapies on

320
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,590
leases and ready to be servers and could
have just play the DHCP snooping

321
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,178
lesser Russell marginally more difficult
for former DGP flood attacks with WiFi

322
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,450
because you have to have the whole life
I can check first before the mac Address

323
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,150
is acknowledged by the AP

324
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,720
arm I mean not that would really stop
someone with particular determined but

325
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,080
you know yeah anything given a nature's
environment I didn't really wanna

326
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,379
good too many armed security you know
controls in place

327
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,090
this is the first year at the port
security and everything so you couldn't

328
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,879
flood

329
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,390
camp it was on the switches and I didn't
really see any evidence

330
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,640
details on that too which is good did
you trying to them

331
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,450
on not going to the gym good

332
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,090
hi I got a record as a hacker con we can
expect people to screw that so yeah okay

333
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,899
i'll know protected anybody else
treasure and every

334
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:06,610
NASCAR I noticed on some respectable

335
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,950
hey this guy's thank you once again I
this is my first hope

336
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,890
and I am just amazing what i've seen
here I saw heroes on this stage before

337
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,120
and I'm on mars

338
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,120
guys

339
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,060
just just one more vote for v6 that the
deal is that

340
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,399
if you never have if no one ever turns
it on anywhere that of course they'll

341
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,190
never be any traffic on it because after
all no one ever turns it on so they

342
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,169
don't have it

343
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,130
so they but but the thing is if it's too
much of a pain in the ass

344
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,669
pain I I will get the application and
turn it on and configure the router

345
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:48,970
week end up looking at my money where my
mouth is it really up to the upstream

346
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,909
provider

347
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:53,070
sure you don't you can't you can't on
all the people on there are people who

348
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,240
for weekend I'll be happy to do it

349
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,580
yeah for for the record this is
something that I'm interested in

350
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,090
in seeing at some point as well whether
it's

351
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,820
whether it's the next time we do this
think you know tearing

352
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,510
year

353
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,980
something yeah but right-center

354
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,080
gonna follow education you can send
emails to

355
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,820
you can send an email and get chatting

356
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,040
you know as per the preparation process
for next time

357
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,340
see what happens okay is a

358
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,189
never getting myself I know that
sometimes when everything is

359
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,860
miraculously working for once

360
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,160
and the day is a bit slow your one of
the fun things you could do is kinda

361
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,700
poke around and see what everybody else
is doing with the network

362
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,830
and I remember somewhere between home
Crean

363
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,490
6 while the guys in an hour gave a
little half our presentation on

364
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,370
interesting

365
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,670
unencrypted messages: the caught while
hanging out

366
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,170
I was wondering if you guys head found
anything interesting anything noteworthy

367
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,510
talk about as ever heard anything like
that it sometime

368
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,260
I noticed most people ports getting
everybody else and in turn towards

369
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,760
getting

370
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,940
their bills that there was you know
probably 30-40 port scans going on

371
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,460
continuously throughout the weekend

372
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,070
for good but I ended up spending most of
the

373
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,090
free time I had on fighting the tent on
getting out working

374
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,490
as an emblem under so in a little bit
too much but

375
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,100
on basically that the pitcher catcher is

376
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,520
one thing that but we should have a bit
on official policy in that what you

377
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,330
don't log can be subpoenaed

378
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,790
I yeah sure you know

379
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,330
Draghi regressing the building

380
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,399
was logged on our side and that's just
for that same reason

381
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,430
I put around a lil bit like I V draft is
watching the

382
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,750
then the the the protocol rates and what
not arm

383
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,640
and Iran dramatic there and don't all
the images out on the ps3 business here

384
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,240
see what was going on with that home
yeah out things didn't die this year

385
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,570
but I know we per we kinda kept busy
looking at things all the time

386
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,429
have another was gonna fall down so
there wasn't too much digging around

387
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,640
like that in

388
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,240
but I guess so up

389
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,410
I would assume the girls one by their
whole lotta Twitter feeds in

390
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,460
and I wanna

391
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:24,460
i'm for Twitter and a

392
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,760
how much BP interview you'll see traffic
did you notice up

393
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,720
well so if vs was the number two
protocol message with the number three

394
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,810
a either one of those could be VPN
tunnels arm

395
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,560
I think I saw Alex understand if you
can't work show up around like eight or

396
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,169
nine

397
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,630
arm saw a few ninety sessions and

398
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,850
knows about it again we were married and
looking at the traffic

399
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,230
this for the help looking at the traffic

400
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,970
is anybody doing anything that might
have been at work to go in service

401
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,060
speaking a VPN

402
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,310
ID try to use it PPTP VPN

403
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,100
on both open networks did connect on the
open open one

404
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,260
but fail consistently on them added one
on he doesn't like to be

405
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,260
yet reason the reason for that is that

406
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,150
is it doesn't cross inactivity is very
well and that's part of why that

407
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,780
why that now open public network was
there

408
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,270
the we got to slash twenty allegations
about sixteen

409
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,590
lassies whatever I'd right there

410
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,780
so you know few thousand IP addresses
right and so

411
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,870
impacted the public when you go one of
those many IP addresses

412
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,080
and you just had a straight-up public
Internet IP in work just fine

413
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,350
yes thing with thing with BP's the GRE
tunnel

414
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,420
and its when it crosses now

415
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,140
there's just nothing really

416
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,860
help injury traffic it says how to line
it up

417
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,310
it doesn't even try to call members and
it's on time I checked some garin

418
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,840
and basically just breaks protocol yeah
see at them

419
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,590
protocol help with make some educated
guesses for that's what the net helpers

420
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,770
for PPP do

421
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,790
make educated guesses so basically if
the protocol helpers

422
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,030
is installed on acix way then you can
reliably worked for

423
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,210
you know one or two people but beyond
that one session and most of them

424
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,350
night implementations will can identify
when she retired online

425
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,400
and that's why we have different works

426
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,460
also for the record PPTP

427
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,990
is relatively vulnerable so if you can

428
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,200
l2tp better yes probably

429
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,780
good in a minute at some point at

430
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,360
yeah my provider offers a choice of that
RSS Alan I was just being cheap

431
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,360
to the SSL being a tad more expensive
what is best coupon world

432
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,590
if you to protect the public eye peas a
number times I P to location

433
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,680
and Kate coming up with that domain on
that's prolly lastly the netbook

434
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,510
you have there would have been an old
that there would be no swim for that

435
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,810
like they would have had that before gun

436
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,000
registered in the air in database and
stuff like that

437
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,720
and so but they're gone now thank you
very much

438
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,920
any other

439
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,160
questions/comments flames in willingly
give much

440
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,100
for the flames something

441
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,620

you might cut in half waivers are

444
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,730
hour to get the kit arm so on wifi stuff
came out my test lab

445
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,750
I work for networks are so arm

446
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,080
let me bring all that gear down here got
help from the cons

447
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,710
and field test I weigh on my page on my
own

448
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,590
runner large campus when large research
computing environment

449

si la to hand me downs sometimes a
switch to get discarded

450

the bed our spine another such get
started with a this post

451

bring together networking switch to seek
Amy wood

452
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,390
Watson what's up hardware on

453
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,950
am able to use for something like this
so if it to mention on may be interested
