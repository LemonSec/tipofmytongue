1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,179
cue

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,290
so many miss college here I am from a
cover

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,950
I'm as someone else's to you okay so I
just Lego

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,199
two and a half million other people we
managed to survive the Olympics

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,779
on years old question how many be ok she
ever been to

6
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,090
Olympic event before research and and I
can see

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,259
I Stice cream

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,369
no of their ego so

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,980
yeah back in a 2003 vaccine for hosts a
decir won the right to host the Olympics

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,840
and in 2010

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,899
me hosted the Winter Olympic so the
topic is compromise exploits

12
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,840
the vendor 2010 Olympics my whole goal
at this content with this topic

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
is basically to discuss the social
issues and the technological

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,440
Obama I would say any problems or
observations that were made

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,180
by 12 per se your neck silver so there's
no brilliance

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,840
exploits involved in this event actually
it's a rather unfortunate

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,339
title I'm so the slogan for at the
Olympics was with glowing hearts are

18
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,560
typically brilliant exploits

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,510
and and probably for announcing that
wrong forget my high school friends

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,000
but basically it's just an excerpt from
the

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,799
Canadian National Anthem and basically
that kind of goes into a topical a copy

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,530
which was on explain a little bit later

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,189
and 10 unfortunate item that came up
during the Olympics when I was at a

24
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,540
curling match where something contact
radio

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,840
have any beer familiar with curling
probably knows that the term hack

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,350
means i'm for the life of me I can't
remember now because

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,430
I'm on the stage cells Fig go figure

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,409
so wanna do is an act bring across five
points I and talk about how the city

29
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,590
becomes lockdown I how the police iraq
to the people

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,950
and that sort of thing on probably you
see a the protests as a good example of

31
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,670
what happened but also discuss other
things that came up

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,869
and also look at the Olympic branding
and copyright how they all relate

33
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm then a look at it out to security in
terms of an

34
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,420
ticket sales and so forth sign it and
its kind the same topic here

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,830
and they're gonna talk about lastly is
how we teach

36
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,720
thought we might and I am against the
CCTV network and what we actually end up

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,209
finding out about in the end

38
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,000
to a further ado gonna go into the
efforts for the topic

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,610
and that is the security so if you take
him to put this in perspective and how

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,970
ridiculous security was at the 2010
Olympics

41
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,879
I'm Salt Lake City which was only a few
months after 9/11

42
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,399
spent a total two hundred million
dollars roughly around there

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,660
under security in that included you know
things like having the noticing a safety

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,849
I guess you guys gonna military but I
guess the National Guard

45
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,540
and links are events on a course having
your say police and so forth

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,329
in the case %uh 2010 Olympics am the
caning government's one with the

47
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,030
provincial government masses and almost
a billion dollars on security

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,470
and I don't know where the money went to
because one explain ticket sales it's

49
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,840
good it's kinda baffling

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,470
but as you can see here you go to a
typical events and you have yourself a

51
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,090
screen as if your gonna fly an airplane
because

52
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,409
you apparently are going to bring in NYS
into the sea

53
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:17,420
in this is dis is me waiting in line to
go into a curling a and so basically I

54
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,739
would pretty much just like going into
an airport except there's no plans from

55
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,129
there

56
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,679
and there's an open field operator now

57
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,450
I don't understand why they had operator
and militarily

58
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,959
drink when there's nothing going on
inside that were hires

59
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,489
good weather but as you can see here at
sign open fields my presumption is that

60
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,909
they're using it somehow to keep to make
sure the number is wondering if

61
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:43,690
I don't know operator enough to actually
explain that sell somebody could

62
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,870
potentially tell me that afterwards and
a force field were very paranoid to

63
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,200
think that people would bring boats into
near the Olympic Village the also had

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,780
scuba diver swimming around the waters
around the

65
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,500
the olympic sites and this is general
insanity the even had

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,819
am see go back serious was that was
actually another order

67
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,260
area they also have a you know if i
think is a free get here actually funny

68
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
reimbursement

69
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,730
thing that makes me very curious about
this is why would you have a large ship

70
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,959
trying to control

71
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,139
people are terrorists is a smile silly
things and Percy had police with

72
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,449
you know swat teams roaming around so
forth

73
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,240
and make this even more absurd the brown
and police officers from all over the

74
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,130
country to

75
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,690
handle security journeyman so we'll send
a private security but they're spreading

76
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,880
outside police

77
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,409
and it was really silly about it was
that the offspring corrections officers

78
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,490
to actually handle some idiotic sites

79
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,220
now knowing the police and how they know
the rates and so forth

80
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,820
I'm slip weird to have corrections
officers who handle prisoners

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,419
I'm patrolling the streets says where
the silly things that observed as I was

82
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,340
I wonder around

83
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,020
and a course there's this whole level
paranoia prior to the Olympics where

84
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,099
on this is where the transit police
upright out these

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,090
at sea know if you see people taking
pictures fire cameras

86
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,539
she called the police now I don't know
white

87
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:14,030
sort of thing that some terrorist one
quote would actually do with a pitcher

88
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,000
%uh VA

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,330
a camera but you know what do I know I'm
not a police officer

90
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,930
so with all these all the security
paranoia from the police and the

91
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,770
government

92
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,719
I'm there is worry meant there was going
around that you know

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,539
rates are gonna be circumvented as you
can see in this photo here here's why

94
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,479
the Olympic mascots

95
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,139
kemper's name I think it's Amy camera
whenever there's a whole bunch mascot on

96
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,060
bring up something later about them am
basically

97
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,370
live from everything you can see here
live rights are being trampled there are

98
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,520
slots applause introduce such as some
homelessness initiative act

99
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,258
which basically if your hometown
homeless on the streets please to pick

100
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,069
you up in 4c go to a shelter

101
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,449
or even supposedly jail and it was
actually really serious because

102
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:05,860
I'm up until then homes for China not so
much but really left alone but as you

103
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,539
want extra

104
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,889
closer online he sings became became
prevalent and

105
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,610
some sort of political issue of a sign
so we have and there was another

106
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,030
initiative it came out worse if you were
to have a sign on your property

107
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,139
that would basically something and he
anti went big for

108
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,539
something that didn't really jive with
the I'll see or the veteran with the

109
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:27,520
committee or VANOC

110
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,680
excuse me on you could be either
arrested or you could be charged

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,410
rest and put in jail for up to three
months or even still

112
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,870
beater find something like a couple
thousand dollars just for having a sign

113
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,880
in your lawn

114
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,900
now there the law isn't

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,370
really the sorry BB the provincial
government panel out the

116
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,470
typical thank you for counsel to
actually amend the pilot actually allow

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,039
certain

118
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,139
men they're cut constitution the city
charter excuse me

119
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,490
to permit see certain rules but as far
as I know was never actually am an

120
00:06:59,490 --> 00:06:59,949
active

121
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,889
fortunately but you know things like
this for passing in this is

122
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,470
sorta the whole kind and nature that was
going on here so

123
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,530
have to excuse me there's no water and
stage here

124
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:19,530
here sorry

125
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,979
sorry missed you so the image in the
city so I think I know if

126
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,300
tired so as you can see here's a little
poster from mom wanted the ante on the

127
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,330
group M

128
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,180
for now I'm you can see here the
attitude from the

129
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,360
people against the sort about action was
pretty appearance take back through the

130
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,699
years

131
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,860
our city was actually when the events I
was organized and I was actually

132
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,169
supposed to coincide with the opening
ceremonies

133
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,409
sincere the 31 main Olympic mascots for
their and they all got together and

134
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,410
actually protest

135
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,199
now so about 3,000 to 5,000 people
converge not too far from where the

136
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,389
Olympics are if you look in the back
towards the left there's actually the

137
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,509
parent the count down the other side was
the Olympic countdown

138
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,699
so this the exit but this clock appear
in it was always a constant target for

139
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,199
people taxi to face and now just 3000

140
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,069
just constancy roseanne doing nothing
but yeah basically they had

141
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,620
mean if there's a ton of people organize
actually outside it was known as a cover

142
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,289
gallery

143
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,479
and it's sexy common experience protests
there

144
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,770
so my the things at the BC Civil
Liberties Association did because they

145
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,210
are fearful that the police were in a
doozy brought in the some legal

146
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,330
observers

147
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,260
and the activities people had was a
factory to ensure that the

148
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,000
rights and privileges he had with the
cane Turner rights and freedoms

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,419
were were kept in line police which
means keeping themselves online

150
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,050
and well there was a lot a contrast
between the protesters and BCCI

151
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,689
afterward

152
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,100
hum overall from from this protest
nothing major actually happened

153
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,740
and you can see here people are marching
towards at BC Place Stadium which is

154
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,500
where the Olympic ceremonies were held

155
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,279
and foreseen actually met with the
police now these are mostly RCMP Amaker

156
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,790
police officers and to even though it
kinda looks like they're pushing on

157
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,149
the protesters there from everything
I've read from the front lines

158
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,470
nothing actually happened the police for
corneil

159
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,440
an the the protesters never really got
outta line per se

160
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,670
on this goes and master contrast to the
g8 g20 protests were as if you're five

161
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,420
years away from them you will be
arrested

162
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,479
self big difference there and its kinda
silly

163
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,930
& Coursey can see they're not that far
away from the actual see him

164
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,570
let's go skate to next day where 200
people decide to March and downtown

165
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,529
and if you're if you're training for
military the term black bloc town of its

166
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,750
use the term using United States

167
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,000
but these black brought protesters have
basically we're

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,070
im involved in this here and there made
teams basically denies later by the

169
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,140
media

170
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,880
and you know the %ah protest through the
city and so forth by throwing

171
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,610
newspaper boxes and mailboxes across the
street really might not know much more

172
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,670
than being a nuisance more than anything

173
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,439
but then it turned to axis keep your

174
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
senator new cracks keys here by 37 the
windows

175
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,880
this is the worst thing that happens
really this is there's nothing worse in

176
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,120
this there is some glass broken and some
stuff spray-painted

177
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,329
on the worst you know this was the this
is the bay 12 largest companies

178
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:29,950
sponsoring the olympics within the
country itself an elitist smashed

179
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,399
windows

180
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,010
so that was worse think so where did the
billion dollars security actually

181
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,079
go to you have to wonder while

182
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,850
take a look at that and the second here
so after the class is massive police

183
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,279
came in

184
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,950
and I'm don the right here and you can
see here the round protesters are back

185
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,850
backing away at this point product out
there

186
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,399
their machine guns sorry a
semi-automatic

187
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,370
anyone know what the Gunners

188
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,769
okay so you can see here they brought
out the heavy artillery at this point I

189
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:03,380
probably should

190
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,610
riverboats I hope am the didn't

191
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,500
the peace process come really deep into
was northwest as possible as intentional

192
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,779
but it was also cited

193
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,470
the Olympic family hotel which is in the
back releasing see here

194
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,130
and police were more concerned about
keeping away from their

195
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,640
am this one person's a course getting
arrested at all the two other people I

196
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,120
think

197
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,209
a couple dozen attacker arrested in
Maine the last laugh

198
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:30,579
remember I like this photo most because
I he's wearing

199
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:37,579
Canada boxers I don't know I why I like
that for a lot so I but I did

200
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,250
and as the videotape term everyone else
everyone else took photos of themselves

201
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,430
figures tit-for-tat from

202
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,750
now this how many your hockey fans

203
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,070
and leave your Rangers fans

204
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,500
case oh about sixteen years ago there
was a certain team from certain city

205
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,279
that might have mentioned earlier

206
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,630
playing against a certain team from a
certain city that reason to stay in that

207
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,990
may or may not be across the street from
here

208
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,720
and I it went all the way to game 7

209
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,440
and that certain team that I was very
fun at it very young age

210
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,970
lost a sad and a Corsair

211
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,350
when one little thing happened in that
city then i'm talking about.

212
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,660
a ride belch their numbers are always
very on what happened here but about

213
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,930
anywhere between 10 and 60,000 people
converged on downtown

214
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,529
thank you for the mall cinema drunk

215
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:44,189
after getting the game 7 and the largest
ride and anchors history after

216
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,519
whatever that right I can remember outta
my head

217
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,829
basically erupted tear gas everywhere if
you ever gone YouTube DC search for

218
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,690
think you're in nineteen eighty four
Stanley Cup riots and you'll see how bad

219
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,850
the situation it is

220
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,529
let's skip to the Olympics how many
people were downtown for the games to

221
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,620
watch them well

222
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,660
their wrists the on average that was
asked me to any between 100 to 200

223
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,459
thousand people or anywhere in a
downtown core any given time during the

224
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,510
two-week event

225
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,519
and you know everyone Spencer skip n
everyone's been all patriotic

226
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,750
happy and the one thing that was kind if

227
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,329
I kinda feared and kinda expected or

228
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:28,470
to happen was I can United States land
up and a gold medal hockey game

229
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,139
and they did on Canadian soil

230
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,029
so the I worry meant I thought that

231
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,779
site where me that I had was that we
would have a review 94

232
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,660
if we lost not enough we wanted the same
thing would happen either but didn't

233
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,680
by any en banc sorry the the Canadian
team did win over the americans and

234
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,360
overtime fortunately

235
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,440
by I not revenue guys faces or anything
than to say

236
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,839
but basically that was my main I was my
main thought about what was

237
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,670
ignored by the media in terms of what
the security costs for going towards it

238
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,720
was actually going to towards prevent
things like

239
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,860
on the 1984 cuts out a cup rights from
if you know

240
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,899
rearing their ugly heads again a lot of
things actually we're done the prior to

241
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:15,570
doing that so they actually stops liquor
sales past 10 p.m. and so forth

242
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,180
or that has has 6 can excuse me I just
prevent the

243
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,010
consumption of liquor in the open
kazakhs illegal just like most

244
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,040
I am North America to drinking water in
the open western about our

245
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,310
Mexico I guess so now is a main concern
but I don't know see how

246
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,079
a billion dollars was needed to stop
that one really there's

247
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,649
is this really seems answered some
magazine idea what the decline it was

248
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,339
like in terms of the

249
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,310
policing and sell for them I'm gonna go
back to the security on it and again a

250
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,480
bit later actually here when I talk
about how

251
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,260
tickets Randall and passes for staff
rambled

252
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,230
so wanna talk about advertising in
Olympic branding so

253
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,180
the IRC is very very protective about
their brand

254
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,810
now case in point there is a pizza place
or

255
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,019
replace a camera where it and what's
which one it serves

256
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:09,800
column MPs and the western and a bank
said at a downtown into work or

257
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,290
and they actually have the only big
rings actually on their logo now

258
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,670
other companies have had their Olympic
rings external as well

259
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,519
now sees manage to force anyone to
misuse is the brand

260
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,260
the Olympic rings brand to remove it
from their signs

261
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,880
so an international organizations been
going to %uh any host country for that

262
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,660
matter taxi have these a slow these
locals removed

263
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,620
but you the real reason for that is not
because they're just may want to make

264
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,759
sure that the sanctity of the Arctic
brings her cat because we all know how

265
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,110
figure skating works

266
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,959
it more or less has to do with how much
money these companies put into

267
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,230
with the advertising its lot on as you
can see here this is one about eight

268
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,100
hours and down in the downtown core

269
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,980
and Samsung for the crappy on the phone
actually

270
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,410
on the power now this is not the only
add it was on the towers like

271
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,160
manner as thrown on top for like
scattered all over the bay

272
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,719
which is he is a professor downtown
pretty much any any

273
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,399
be able any people advertise its was use

274
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,480
and you can see here companies that want
to broadcast the games

275
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,959
pay a lot of money to in the xy in turn
have to show the Olympic rings

276
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,389
for like dino during the year that they
received broadcast the Olympics

277
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:27,370
and in this case here the exceed on the
Olympic rings rate on the outside at the

278
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,970
outside the the brats are the station
itself

279
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,420
and of course everything as I was saying
earlier every single sign-on

280
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,339
advertising spaces by I've could not
even leave the transit system doesn't

281
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,500
matter how far away is from the Olympics

282
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,550
on without running across 1 it's all the
transit signs are all the Transit has

283
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,920
been replaced with

284
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,980
Olympic at C&C years at these Adonia bus

285
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,170
a stop there but it doesn't mean that
you can't

286
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,790
0 advertise relating to the Olympics now

287
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,180
if you it's kinda Wearhouse for example

288
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,669
in order to not get in trouble with the
IRC urbana

289
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,339
QFC were not advertise anything where
2010

290
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,379
Olympics or Vancouver I think winter is
also part is awesome

291
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,880
you can make any mention any loss for
words if you can advertise anything that

292
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,530
could be

293
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,579
misconstrued as a part of the Olympic so
if you're in itself

294
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,730
flags are you still sporting here are
you gonna sell things like

295
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,980
anything that in general that could
somehow come back to be an Olympic thing

296
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,210
you can upload those words in there so

297
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,370
in this case your neck he just decided
to allow people to summits

298
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,220
phrases to exceed on on this %uh
projected wall here which is not too far

299
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,419
from

300
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,820
with the baby was his accent on exxon
the Sears downtown

301
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,600
and you could just basically some in a
message would be shown on is the

302
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,660
projector as you can see here or you
could be really creative

303
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,929
and actually sell products am

304
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,600
that actually remember sorta semi
branded as a be an Olympic but they're

305
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,100
not

306
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,059
so in this case here a little lemon
athletica basically decided to

307
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,539
sell these are clothes that were colored

308
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,610
in the colors a effort is being with the
team so you can see your sweet and his

309
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,720
woman here is dawning

310
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,990
painted black tooth which for some
reason must be attractive

311
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,230
and I and basically you know

312
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,760
all we have is like sweet in Canada the
United States and their colors on there

313
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,200
but they did make mention of any those
weren't so

314
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,770
nothing about winter Vancouver 2010 her
at the Olympics

315
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,830
Lululemon action kept this on the market
for about us

316
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,889
having was I I might be wrong but i
think is no more than a week

317
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,640
and there's a lot of heat generated
towards them and eventually the

318
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,919
buckle down after spending all this
money on ways all this scene on

319
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,679
all these all this material making this
I want the kearsarge quote-unquote

320
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,230
Olympic year

321
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,740
and you know they stop selling it after
all this pressure from the icy so

322
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,360
you to try and get away with it so
easily you know

323
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,669
the IRC in vanna will or sorry in the
Olympic Committee for that particular

324
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:02,010
country will actually

325
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,539
clamp down hard on mix like say later on
it with them and decide they want to be

326
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,230
the official

327
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,630
pics a fire for I don't know 2016 or
whatever

328
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,610
when pics are coming out he is they may
not be able to do because they screwed

329
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,350
around them

330
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,940
when the Olympics so cynical very few
hirsch

331
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,799
can go back to Napa some major point at
the half has I actually got to see him

332
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,400
live so is actually pretty players but
this bit here is pretty straightforward

333
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,789
if your watch this video he was doing is
talking about what can I do

334
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:36,390
fun to talk about the Olympics and
grocers whole process explained

335
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,780
can't use the Olympic rings you can make
any reference in with the crazy can

336
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,370
change shape for the Olympic rings

337
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,820
and this case here you can have the
colors donning the Olympic Cassar the 12

338
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,320
colors and some sort of

339
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,460
flatline going 90 so

340
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,980
it's really it's really silly when terms
how the copyright for example this is

341
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,240
what he did so into coming up with a
quick quadrennial

342
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,700
I am cold weather athletic competition
or something like that as we refer to it

343
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,409
as

344
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:07,789
and missus it mind you it was early
winter is more Spring exit during the

345
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,129
Olympics is here but

346
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,059
in this just give you 90 the absurdity
that the whole copyright aspect is the

347
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,030
Olympics

348
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,928
see nicole there was pretty bang on
about it

349
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:22,960
and it's kinda sad though because with
the Olympics I'm comes a lot of problems

350
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,710
like in this case here when they do come
to town they do get rid

351
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,980
anything graffiti like in this was not
we feel like this was actually in our

352
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,200
project

353
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,720
on the Citibank you were actually trying
to get ready this art project

354
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,659
and eventually backed down on it but all
it was was just

355
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:40,360
something is enough for quite a while
but the times graffiti cuz it was

356
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,780
painted on a app

357
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,490
you know cart Sorry plywood board over
when no one really was actually but

358
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,169
there's a

359
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:50,780
Archies miss the exceeded went on one
thing at a really one night's

360
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,168
I'm somebody plastered blue paint all
over an existing

361
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,450
euros a nice profit that and then a
course for the controversy came out the

362
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,940
penny sign up says new mural coming soon
and has been like that since then

363
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,900
says kind of awful but

364
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,350
tries he must protect the Olympics
Olympic I

365
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,220
try to protect the Olympic brand on it
doesn't always work self

366
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,409
pedobear apparently became a party big
brand

367
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:25,669
and II and when I'm telling you when I'm
telling years is quite true

368
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:29,059
the he did become for tonight big brand
inadvertently

369
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:34,470
because he was featured in a Polish
newspaper

370
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,390
so I don't know how this came to be
exactly

371
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,659
by my assumption like everyone else i is
pretty much the 1i Google Image Search

372
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:48,030
did Vancouver 2010 mascots and that came
out

373
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,830
and said sure

374
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,510
mind you they hated us later on when
where it was its now I was actually

375
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,770
serbian I think actually that had an
accident but

376
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,929
some Eastern European country had this
poor guy I see crass but nonetheless

377
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,309
gash jokes joke's on us

378
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,850
so retirement tickets here on

379
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,570
tickets for the Olympics were gonna put

380
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,590
this is where my question about where
this one billion dollars and security

381
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,709
when because I actually thought that the
sick tickets were

382
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,549
in secure there is nothing redeeming
about them in terms of security

383
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,200
amount of any beer ever seen Tom be

384
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,900
25 C three ty on bar codes before but
I'm probably gonna tell you

385
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,850
everything you wear the burqa their
prize to the Olympics in Vancouver

386
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,100
so these are your typical tickets you
would get minus the

387
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,700
data fear 0 exe standard center here on
that's it

388
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,539
you can actually there's nothing there's
no real security others no water prints

389
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,679
the is our No water yep sorry watermarks
excuse me

390
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,289
and the only thing that authenticates
quote-unquote that it's a official in

391
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:57,970
the ticket is the

392
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,049
the hologram on the bottom right there

393
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,270
or you gonna buying why these tickets
here which is starring in it ha grams

394
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,950
there

395
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,280
which is what I end up buying that
actually has nothing

396
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,450
you can see here this is a standard scan
ticket there's no water marks is

397
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,159
pretty much the exact photocopy have the
tickets iPod

398
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,039
except for the hologram there which
doesn't copy over but I explain in a

399
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,030
moment here wanna holograms stupid

400
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,090
and there's the back nothing on the back
there

401
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,449
or you can Olympic pass once again has
no security several perforation goes

402
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,539
down the bottom anyone with a

403
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,879
me to land at a time could replicate and
the friend was

404
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,289
nice enough taxes can his in

405
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,919
you see here no security no security

406
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,960
no security so how do you copy a pass

407
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,390
well thanks to high definition
television it's not that hard you can

408
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,390
pretty much just watch TV

409
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,059
and way for the past two come along

410
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,809
and you can become in part iv: the
Olympic speedskating team in this case

411
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,440
here

412
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,010
really it is that easy reside remember
couple missus is watching

413
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,570
couple matches and you to see those
passing you in one case I was able to

414
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,408
read the tax on the bottom but

415
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,890
if you go back you know you have to do
is just you know

416
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,179
come out with some bullshit name like no
cleaning cleaner cleaning services which

417
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,230
was real

418
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,850
sorry to say like janitors something
like that and all that mattered was that

419
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,419
it looks real now

420
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,380
you going to be wondering what do you do
about the mohagher in there

421
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,659
well that's very kind of silly

422
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:35,850
and also talk about this in a sec here
actual bring this up shirt some needed

423
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,250
actually masses KK to pass now

424
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,580
this is not this is from my
understanding not the past but this is

425
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,470
the past that supposedly the media was
told about which was

426
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,150
some difference in a pass from Yahoo
Canada said all access

427
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,260
massey get within 10 meters for Vice
President Joe Biden

428
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,710
there is somebody who surprisingly is a
huge fan of a job I and that he had to

429
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,029
meet him

430
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:02,669
and fifty came in within ten years after
going through all the security check so

431
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,870
this is really are doing dollars and
security in action and you know

432
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,370
cut 10 meters away from now I don't know
in 10 meters is and

433
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,590
yards as by way 30 arts and that's fair
that's pretty

434
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,899
okay so tenure same years you know
that's ballpark right there

435
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,070
so you got really freaking close see
teary eyes vice president itself

436
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,139
always was supposedly passed like this
but thing is though

437
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,710
not secrets don't see secrets for a
while and why the people who worked in

438
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,730
BC Place

439
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,450
when the 10 concerns were going on when
this incident happened

440
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,240
on only heard was that no it was in that
pass it was actually copied

441
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,289
staff asked that had a Marco stolen from
a Visa card

442
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:50,090
so pretty much answered my question I
when I heard about this did they

443
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,900
actually care about

444
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,690
markowitz really good time to care about
the bar code is when he answered into

445
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,190
the Olympic Stadium

446
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,880
or its original a big event now I am go
back to explain why those tickets for

447
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,590
Steve in the first place

448
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,860
in a moment here but even if you can
grab the

449
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,450
americans are the hologram from the rob
a bank had a Visa card here you could

450
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,909
just as well go buy something from the
omitted from the ritz asthmatic

451
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:13,049
merchandise

452
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:16,960
and just you know will blow dryer pull
off the sticker off the label it came if

453
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,409
you're quite see their

454
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,929
so should this is worry comes down to
Kenny copy a pass in the answer is yes

455
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:24,350
he could have done that there's

456
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,919
no are fitted to be that was the first
thing that we thought of when we had

457
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,870
decided to exit by around these tickets

458
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,240
the bar codes really don't have anything
security Sanders security number

459
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,169
conserved

460
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:40,480
don't go on one hand in hand and there's
no real watermarks on the mitre so

461
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,200
go back there per se sold what was the
other problem with the tickets well

462
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,169
to talk with the ticket sale system now
metonomy slides for it but

463
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,539
and BC is ax and most can it is legal to
scalp tickets

464
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:56,990
but there's a way to get around it you
get a license to sell tickets resell

465
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,100
tickets

466
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,679
now in the past on the banker connects
try to lockdown

467
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,640
ticket scalping and all they ever all
the intercom bliss was everyone got

468
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,779
themselves license so

469
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:10,320
prior to that everyone is hanging around
the streets down there hockey tickets

470
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,939
for you know

471
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,789
300-400 dollars no and says 70 bucks for
the paper the tickets

472
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:18,679
so when they try to track down everyone
said oh screw will just legitimize

473
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,289
ourselves

474
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:22,669
just get a license to sell these tickets
and now is multiple companies inaccurate

475
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:24,289
actually sell tickets

476
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:27,480
resell tickets after the gym but so

477
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,159
VANOC knowing that this would be a
problem answer president ready a lot

478
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,580
passport but

479
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,960
decided that they would create their own
ticket sale system so if you buy a

480
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,950
ticket for you know

481
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,240
this curling your cock yourself like
that and see you can

482
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,880
make it well you could just go and sell
your tickets for the van Ark accredited

483
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,429
ticket cell site now problem with that

484
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:51,799
is that you is this you would sell a
ticket

485
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,750
but if you're one of those people who
and others fancy tickets which I showed

486
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,789
a little bit earlier

487
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,559
which has will nicely art on and so
forth you actually got to keep that

488
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,590
ticket

489
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,510
even if you sell on the ticket online
exam we just go to the ticket vendor

490
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,010
and actually have just by Ken ticket
printed out

491
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,700
it was a souvenir for you now the
problem with that is that

492
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,700
you could just go and resell that ticket
to

493
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,399
so you did make money off it for 60
never was nice if you want to buy the

494
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,049
ticket you know vannatter taking a 15
percent error where the hell is charged

495
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,168
and you Jeffersonville ago the game
where they paid for

496
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:31,740
but then you still have that this will
take it so you could either a

497
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,570
your scalp in the outside risking arrest
her be just on Craigslist and just go

498
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,270
sell your tickets that way

499
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,270
and this actually happened several
people they actually plans

500
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,220
and poppy signature Craigslist and found
that they were deactivated because

501
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,190
somebody

502
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,460
had already sold the tickets prior to so
you can make twice as much money back on

503
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,029
those tickets is because

504
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,960
VANOC don't think this whole system
through

505
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,320
and if you want going back to the whole
Olympic

506
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,629
terms you're pretending to be a big step
it's actually not that hard you can see

507
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,179
here this a.m

508
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:06,230
water ocean blue kinda jacket and the
red gloves prexy readily available

509
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,950
pretty much any

510
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:13,049
any the bay for sellers I'm start
shopping oppressors

511
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,710
stew part minced or so if you have that
passing the have the jacket he had those

512
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,770
clubs which everyone in the country seem
to have during that time

513
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,299
on you probably could just got away with
it known about the lanyard but the Jacka

514
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:26,100
definitely

515
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,330
so last heart you're my sis prize a
Mexican much faster

516
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,010
well okay I'm so last part in this is
all about the CCTV camera network

517
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,419
and this for pretty much just had a lot
of us and thank you for who were

518
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:42,340
interested in security and privacy

519
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,070
I'm pretty bothered on this one can
using MCT was the official broadcaster

520
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,178
the Olympics and I see happen like to
slow that some be found there

521
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,980
but throughout town Bankura they had
several cameras some setup

522
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,159
basically just watch every move and
every person in the game's

523
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,529
made Andy skin he risk

524
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:06,860
ahead here to see another camera here

525
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,960
actual back so entire

526
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,500
security camera system a set up
throughout of element at Ross roll all

527
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,200
the sites and thank you for now there
are some

528
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,090
my cam the people that I say

529
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:25,549
sorry so imagine normally there's about
900 to 1200 cameras in the downtown core

530
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:30,250
ons when the cat when we want pics came
in the added an extra 2,000 cameras

531
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,350
and just all the Olympic events and
that's not

532
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,200
that's quite a number when you think
about the size of the space at the I'll

533
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,529
take

534
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:41,649
and the system was adopted was a some
economy cast which is Micah back from

535
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:42,600
coconut in it

536
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,620
sorry Jan attack which is really stupid
name

537
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,830
and this is the sort a diagram that they
gave out with it so it's pretty simple

538
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,939
IP camera system on but it's rather
interesting because

539
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,520
you can actually be integrated with
something called out a view which is

540
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,370
some certain places plate reader

541
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,399
or the center just which is an IP

542
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,159
is another I keep a system which you as
you do elevator control access control

543
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,279
that's really think so

544
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:10,779
it was like a whole integrated system so
when I first heard this system serving

545
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,740
in so I kinda wondered if this is gonna
be a permanent thing because

546
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,279
if the took these cameras and integrated
with the on a few systematic or seeking

547
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,769
cue track your movements through

548
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:22,669
license plates and so forth so it's kind
of interesting in that respect that they

549
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,919
are adopting a system

550
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,080
but and as you can see here in this the
whole map that was actually

551
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,029
mills are the cameras prior to the
olympics so that's fine its website was

552
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,559
in there

553
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,519
in that order excuse me but this is the
thing that kinda guys interested so we

554
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,169
figured out it was you know your
standard camera set up you know mp4

555
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,210
h264 that sort of thing and

556
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,630
it was you know had IP now accounts for
now is OK

557
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,340
uses standard IP camera but then we
became process transmission methods and

558
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,250
discovered 0

559
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,820
it could be doing it over wireless so
three we got really excited over this

560
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,408
was taking your ok great you know these
guys are really stupid how could you

561
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:05,309
implement a system that you know permits
you know wireless camera sry

562
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:08,450
and you know you decide okay three three
of us from

563
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,960
other three of us decided that we're
gonna go ahead and do this year's Cano

564
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,909
go and see if we can sniff out these
cameras rakes the wireless then

565
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:20,929
theoretically week in view them me so we
decide to go for a walk

566
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,559
so we walks from one point the downtown
core 2

567
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,908
was no scanty Street Bridge which sexy
basically covered

568
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:31,019
am where the hockey games were at have
held

569
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,460
and then where the Russian

570
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,620
Russian pavilion was and that long where
the

571
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,370
the olympic village is unable to build
is on the left side of the screen as you

572
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,529
can see line this low around here

573
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,600
and you know we probably should have
thought this through before we did this

574
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,100
by

575
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,909
when you're in a highly densified area
you know trying to track down wireless

576
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:51,419
networks

577
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,620
is I'm a specific groceries is a pain in
the ass

578
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm when we actually finished the job we
want from there there we found out there

579
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,059
is now known as a good day to

580
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:04,950
and you know is painfully hard to sort
through

581
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,250
now again backtracked will be here in
are served as back up a lil bit here in

582
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:14,330
before a say anything here I can mention
what we found only 13 because

583
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,409
how Canadian realize we're gonna
non-lawyers I descend

584
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:21,480
getting this understanding ron is we can
listen in

585
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,590
but we can tell you the contents what we
found as we walked alongside can tie it

586
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,640
what we said what we saw happen along
the route or anything like that

587
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,539
when I can tell you is we didn't find
anything now

588
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:39,200
which is kinda sad but I can't I we
didn't find anything

589
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,559
so you can see here these were the years
we targeted

590
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,168
and is easier to low I'm ready area down
there was actually close to couple days

591
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:50,590
shortly after we done that little job
there

592
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,350
so magazine with an idea for what these
ordinary working with them

593
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,269
what was happening but you know it's ok
for walking for inner-city

594
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:02,460
see what about the closing is a few days
after around here so

595
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,580
masa said recovered from a heavy
drinking few days for four

596
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,899
am were willing to do this walk we want
to go to the cameras you know their

597
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:12,040
standards

598
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,639
you know wrote you know your standard
fixed cameras in your standard dynamic

599
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,490
movement cameras animee you know so
little boxes there

600
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,579
and if you look towards the bottom
lawyer thing there from not mistaken is

601
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:23,230
actually

602
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,560
amor para alla so you know probably

603
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,659
week we've had a dismayed you know the
Paris probably not running to them you

604
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,929
know is that we can't do anything with
this

605
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,700
is nothing broadcasting you know we did
see the lines being run our place we

606
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,609
don't know if they're

607
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:41,069
eater netter their five yr what's so be
rather disappointed find out

608
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:45,270
we did find out though that this Lee in
a top is actually a giant Iron Lady Mary

609
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:45,589
River

610
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:48,609
trying to figure out you know we thought
it might have been some sort a radar

611
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,290
system the combat with because reason
wireless but

612
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,639
in the end we figured it was actually
I'm some sort of

613
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,010
giant I R flashlight so to speak

614
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,660
but one of the guys so we would so
whenever sexy took a walk to work one

615
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,118
morning and found them setting up a
camera

616
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,750
and lo and behold it was actually 3.net

617
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,650
so basically all needed to run this
whole network was just make one giant

618
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,849
me to network is just nothing special
about it

619
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:21,369
and yeah it was that a sweet ride
against the CCTV network early scan

620
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,839
understanding if in the end it turned
out to be nothing fancy

621
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,578
which is kinda disappointing by yeah I'm

622
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:31,609
pretty much that semi-hollow overview I
hope

623
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:35,140
that from the stock your neck and
inspires people when they're in London

624
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,750
or there and i'm sachi I doubt there's
anyone here from Soji here in

625
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,930
be interest there or if you're in rio

626
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,259
you know I've crowing clergy to just
take a look at the systems at the No

627
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,030
implemented or even ask if they actually
manager systems properly and not in

628
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,150
half ass it like they have turned the
Olympics see you think three billion

629
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,510
dollars it would have done a better job
but

630
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,930
yeah and also thanks to everyone who has
helped me and some

631
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,669
people from a turn organizations help
out Chris R

632
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,930
for instance thank you sam free and
pretty vocal about me nance Olympic I'm

633
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,310
not

634
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,078
anti when picking up for Olympic to see
as now but

635
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,430
yeah I just hope that I'm this can only
set with Sumter inspiration

636
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:21,430
some thank you

637
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:31,930
going on as a question okay

638
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,280
so a I just came from Canada to I wasn't
rano

639
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,780
so I got to experience whole t20 thing
full force

640
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,720
and not a lot of the things you
mentioned it struck a parallel with me

641
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,270
because

642
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,119
Tron audit but to the next level we
spent ten billion dollars on security

643
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,440
10 I think that was the number now 11
because what to say

644
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,010
I I'm getting up now but Tom right

645
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,010
I was wondering if you've heard much
about Bryant's on

646
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,470
and his arrest as he was doing similar
things in terms of mapping out the

647
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,570
camera networks and

648
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:10,160
detachment you can assess kaya yeah I
don't know much about him actually to be

649
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,540
honest with you I but when I found out
he was assessed and then somebody

650
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,240
being a dick actually wanna go to assist
right-handed

651
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,200
I was very impressed over that but I
don't know much done the same anything

652
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,520
but I do have the same rather impressed
that trust and doing dollars in three

653
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,869
days and we spent a billion dollars over

654
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,300
three we scattered over two months lol I
guess ron is all about spending more

655
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,760
town of this this meant US

656
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,760
okay um I'm actually from Mission BC and
arms

657
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,820
yeah I was there for the entire Olympics
evens

658
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,310
run out was born raised their and lights
around

659
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,520
right after 2003 to when

660
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,160
2010 hit there was just all this
pandemonium in

661
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,930
media and it was really the media more
than it was people mike night

662
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,089
friends family did not give a shit like
I really did not know anyone who was

663
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,560
afraid about kato rainy

664
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,630
terrorist organization coming to BC and
start step up

665
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,830
I can save it for everyone but the
people I knew terry but there was like a

666
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,660
great pandemonium in the media

667
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,310
up the crime ok Gabrielle ready when I'm
ready and knife

668
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,000
per se talk to like RCMP officers yeah
I'm really scared about

669
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,300
Sen like went off without a hitch I just

670
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,950
where do you feel that fear and anxiety
came from from the government

671
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,380
that you know there might have been
something really large coming to because

672
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,460
I did not see it

673
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,750
ID with a December that has come from a
prior politicians

674
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,290
and everything makes sense to I think
the whole attitude really comes down to

675
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,820
what's going on in this country for
instance and I think kinda reflects upon

676
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,570
what most the western governments are
doing these days which is

677
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,560
you know this whole you know fear
uncertainty and doubt an

678
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,240
realistically in the end Tom I think

679
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,020
lot of people have become conditioned to
the idea that they should country down

680
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,390
nation but their heads in the sand Cyn
sprayed it nothing bad goes on and

681
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,319
let you know other companies who sell
the security products to

682
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,220
run amok and you know keep us from dying
but honestly

683
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,420
you know worst things ever happened
during the Olympics is actually no

684
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,320
it worse things are happening when pics
is what happened Atlanta 96 which is

685
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,940
worry

686
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,670
pipe bomb went off UNIX Munich is a four
unit was Ian that was before that is

687
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,180
correct

688
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,319
with the idea the Israeli Air kidnapped
from an estimate correct

689
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,260
Munich yes so but I really think most
the Olympic security paranoia is gone

690
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,770
were since 96 but I think with 911 and
all these other things that come along

691
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,430
the governments have decided well

692
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,879
it's in our best interests to go that go
to the extreme you know it's unnecessary

693
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,750
ditches one more quick question do you
think you should been handled the same

694
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,280
way

695
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,060
if it was done all over again do you
think thank you have done the same way

696
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:57,160
you know it's funny I I think you would
be because it's so

697
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,009
thank you wanted so see what people
think so she's unprepared and has a good

698
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,810
chance it could come back to Vancouver

699
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,520
if you were to come back to make her
come back to North America which she

700
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:05,990
might

701
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:09,510
actually would expect it to I would
think that same level turn I would come

702
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:09,980
back

703
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,500
whether or not the Spanish as much money
I ever spent more

704
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,180
I don't know thank you looks like you're
getting all the Canadians asking

705
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:18,740
questions

706
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,970
it the first film mission is it the g20
and g8 intron recently

707
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,340
and the point's been made that a similar
cost for security was spent on

708
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,650
post that in the Olympics but at least
in the case %uh Vancouver

709
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,250
they got the potential a economic
benefits of being on the Today Show

710
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:35,859
begins:

711
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:39,380
seem cauldron that so I wonder if you
give us your thoughts on that

712
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,480
and also with regard to the the block
block tactic city pension

713
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,050
that happened on the first and thank you
course we saw entrado please cars being

714
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:47,590
torched

715
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,560
but prior to the olympics the head of
Olympic security was asked if

716
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,590
he would rule ok the possibility of the

717
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,640
using the agent provocateur toxic and
cucumber sorry and would not rule that

718
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:58,970
out

719
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,060
it seems that we always see these these
people like kurt

720
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,910
and we never fight off with your butt in
the media it's reported that protesters

721
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,680
torched police cars

722
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,669
in a scuttle it reminds me of when you
know some some company allows

723
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:15,170
a you know the security to be breached
it's reported as hackers

724
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,220
you know penetrate security when they
don't know who penetrated the Securities

725
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,800
ok

726
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,100
it starts or whatever but your thoughts
on that as well with regard to the

727
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,859
via block tactics well and black bloc
tactics

728
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:30,299
I speaking exciting own speaking as a
for a history major i don't really find

729
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,090
their tactics is really weird

730
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,950
life it's not unusual see the sort of
thing whether or not agree with them

731
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,680
its its kinda you know gilbert et cetera
situation I don't know

732
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,220
how to address it really is they give
you for proper answer that going

733
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,260
and 20 if you feel that was in fact
people that were

734
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,780
I'll be taking over was possibly I'm in
assigning a 50-50 on I like I think he

735
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,640
is very likely did actually have that's
relevant but

736
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,109
at the same time I can give you an
answer at a rate so and little contrast

737
00:41:58,109 --> 00:41:59,250
in Vancouver's

738
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,170
security 00 dry I would say that was
better value for the money even

739
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,300
I don't know whether or not the Olympics
and it will spin off anything good for

740
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:06,900
the city

741
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,920
but whether or not the it was better to
spend it in Vancouver or Toronto it's a

742
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,120
banker definitely

743
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,480
researchers at least it was for the
people enough for no

744
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,820
forty reynolds guys who I don't give a
damn about

745
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,480
yeah I'm just wondering if from if the
Vancouver city environment was

746
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,210
was restored to its initial state where
were all the cameras taking down where

747
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,280
all the security mechanisms taken downer
all

748
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,630
for trying all the walls disappeared so
that was a good thing but with regards

749
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,950
the cameras

750
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,540
measure policeman to my to keep them and
they're really not pushing for

751
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,670
unfortunately this current city council
seems to have some serious im 17

752
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,109
Telligent seem no its kind to be able

753
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:56,660
and they just voted against devoted to
keep the cameras could not keep them

754
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,200
on fixed so basically what the man is
they have the camera still but they're

755
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,770
not in place in the morning

756
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,890
bring the mounds parent name on their
special events going on

757
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,150
I kinda take that view as in the the

758
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,260
they want to just keep it around and see
reconsider implementing and kisses

759
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,200
always been that talk to bring cameras
into downtown core anyway

760
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,570
as a common topic comes across the whole
country to be in with so

761
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:23,030
I I'm hoping that the camera see is go
away and they don't come back but like

762
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,790
they could wear

763
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,839
rear their ugly head again so

764
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,750
hi I'm I heard that there was a lot of
trouble with the weather

765
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,520
in the Olympics and I was wondering was
there any interesting technology

766
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,690
deployed to

767
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,980
dump trucks just in time for it to snow

768
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,650
I kid you not so the said Beach they
weren't lying when they said it was

769
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,570
going to be the greenest Olympics
because

770
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,030
it was plain green grass everywhere if
you sign it first photo if I was going

771
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,030
to the growing Matt

772
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,020
kids go to curling oh that Greenfield
there that was our

773
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,880
that was the first-ever spring Olympics
on now that's for sure

774
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,780
but they didn't they had a snow event
the executes all these people have

775
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,180
standing to actually watch the games cuz
resist

776
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,299
months no over the place but what they
did is a

777
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,540
brought snow from place commanding Park
which is about 203 and a climbers' away

778
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,160
from

779
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,879
thank you for itself run all the way
into the city centre into the

780
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,230

city just so people could ski on

781
