7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,270
ephemera that I collected through my
childhood and then in my late twenties

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,650
I decided to put all online because I
thought that we have enough

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,809

people come to me and say things like

12
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:42,649
and I started reading you

13
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:47,780
when I started on the Internet and so
now I'm in college and I'm in computer

its mission

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,349
I've kinda moved into doing
documentaries I've collected graphics

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,770
and podcasts and

20

29
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,880
few years ago

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,190
or or as some new company makes a add

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:53,350
people right to me and the cunt pepper

on the Twitter me

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,750
and one by one people started toward me
going do you know about this digital

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,220
a love story thing a round I was busy

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,530
mom can I was I was traveling and doing
stuff but

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,038
it was like dino mite additional love
story and I clicked over the data

37
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,920
quickly as I can

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,269
effort and this went on for a while

39
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,549
and then finally I had the opportunity I

40
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:21,139
end up taking a train from Cleveland to

41
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:25,349
New York which I don't recommend and in
this

42
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,760
cylindrical to have pain in misery I

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,149
was lucky enough to have a a plug so I
could

44
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,260
plug in my laptop and I finally said
okay fine I I will should check this

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,060
thing out I was just blown away

46
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,760
what this is is this is a point and
click the trencher

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,129
based around calling

48
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,649
computer bulletin board systems that
builds itself

49
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,659
up into a love story a story of tragedy
have hope

50
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,760
%ah makes you play several

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,358
are roles and by roles inning and I'll
subset of being a person who uses both

52
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,799
imports to achieve

53
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,329
what comes to it as a goal and

54
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,469
its kinda music soundtrack to it which
PBS's didn't have which makes it even

55
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:08,999
better

56
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:13,049
and it was beautiful and it came out

57
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,999
and at the end she thanks the the author
who was

58
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:20,668
Christine love thanks text files to calm
for historical research

59
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,790
and this is a background for a story

60
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,858
and her research had come primarily

61
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,989
by reading things that I

62
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,859
had copied of of Baltimore its systems
as a teenager

63
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,930
so I thought I gotta meet this person

64
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,590
sold this is the first time you know we
just met yesterday

65
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,029
in person and I wanted to come down so

66
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:50,129
that's the story I am so I guess

67
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,590
if you wanna introduce yourself as you
prefer to tell people

68
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,290
well no I'm not tripping introductions
I'm

69
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,298
stern tube English literature I am i
minor in history so

70
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,590
obviously I am writing about the fat far
Pakistan

71
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,639
pass at 1988 is obviously about special
interest to me

72
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm this was just some another project I
picked up by I thought that this would

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,060
appeal to actually nobody but me

74
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,890
um the next thing I know people arm are
tiny that it's all over going like cell

75
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,919
a comic art so it's definitely
BoingBoing jus

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,550
you wrap it saying here Korean pool
steampunk art on it he would've been

77
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,910
like my

78
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,980
and thats you know arm so a I mean

79
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,670
obviously I mean you could do

80
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,040
AST cyber love story a story in which

81
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,260
you know relationships online are the
theme what made you choose Bolton boards

82
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,920
armor its

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,480
the faxes its as an air it fascinates me
this is am

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,880
0 yes sir I I'm wonderful public
speaking missus I'm certainly not on dat

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,750
on nervous

86
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,890
Anna well I don't mean to put you on the
spot but

87
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,610
Aikido idea Waibel to import systems
versus say

88
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,250
just pure internet or maybe doing one on
Twitter or me what about

89
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,670
in you know why why choose baltimore's
verses

90
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,660
you know my these other social media as
they call it now

91
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,670
events well it's it's not just a love
story also a mystery story and I think

92
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,700
that's the real important thing is is
that for this mystery I want to make it

93
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,140
so that damn

94
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,860
I want to put in a more mysteries age I
guess and that's a

95
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,310
it seems like a weird thing to say but a
in the eighties see on these Baltimore

96
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,140
systems everything seems so much farmer

97
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,990
see so much for isolated I think back is
deathly conducive to I'm telling him

98
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,630
I love story it's a making connection on
am

99
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,340
when everyone's on the Internet is a a
little less I interesting

100
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,940
where the plant the isolation and
justice is very much

101
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,170
a story about adolescent Liam a
searching for some sir connection and I

102
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,280
think a

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,440
putting any he's putting it in him on
Baltimore systems a

104
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,350
the health dept I do know I mean I

105
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,980
you know it makes me think I've the fact
that I knew my father tended to wake up

106
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,150
between $5.25 in five forty five in the
morning

107
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,420
so I knew that I could work until about
445

108
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,750
and get to bed before he would scream at
me cuz you realize I had not

109
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,710
gone to bed and a

110
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,680
one of the ways that we kind of try to
fight that was having in person

111
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,140
meetings and having phone conferences
you know unfortunately phone conferences

112
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,550
account the real lost ephemera this

113
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,770
because we look at the bones of the
vault imports system it does seem very

114
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,810
isolated

115
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,400
and people would endeavor to meet each
other as soon as possible to get rid of

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,940
that

117
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,550
feeling but if you called in to abort
abort system that was far away

118
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,940
and didn't have a local aspect then you
really felt like you were

119
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,290
distanced in observing and you know some
people say no I felt really close but

120
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,150
they also is

121
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,210
I would see there was abort abort system
outcall in Minneapolis

122
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,550
and I didn't meet those guys until

123
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,190
2003 and I had been

124
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,230
on their bulletin board system in 1983
so twenty years later I met them

125
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,240
their fatter now I

126
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,590
brilliant the fat um and

127
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,390
so I would from I'd agree with you from
from

128
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,969
from a kid's perspective but on the
other hand there is that part that where

129
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,280
which comes across i thinkin in the way
you put it together where

130
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,070
you might feel a little cut off and
still make okay

131
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,230
first of all in the beginning you have

132
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,040
a shop owner give you a ball to import
system

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,180
number cuz they say oh me know thanks
for but you know just

134
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,700
who you go here's here's a number want
to call it

135
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,400
night and that is exactly how it worked

136
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,010
exactly how it works somebody would give
your phone number and say try this with

137
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,170
your modem

138
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,470
and that was the next eight years

139
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,520
so that's what you know that peace ovett
a ghetto

140
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,860
this just fast it's because you didn't
have to add to your

141
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,070
you're actually you note there's a part
where you're trying to get phone codes

142
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,179
and its pitch perfect is pitch perfect
because the phone code might stop

143
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,460
working

144
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,520
and suddenly you are a chunky

145
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,250
your in the street you're doing this and
you're like

146
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,460
also meant gonna have collude someone's
gonna have good moods

147
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,320
and I got a lot of complaints about that
about that aspect present for people who

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,310
are meh

149
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,380
who are more my age armed weren't
familiar with that

150
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,939
searching for all-cause cusick and I got
people saying that

151
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,290
I lack I coffee at the keep going to
check for cost like

152
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,689
yeah at the feeling so they're
complaining about a basic

153
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,510
game mechanic I inherent in the game

154
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,279
if not much missing the point is not
quite understand the point which

155
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,680
I I think it's

156
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,990
so so you've gotten feedback I love your
feedback from two days ago by the way

157
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,060
my first %uh piece of ham hate mail he
I'm so excited about this

158
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,880
finally I'm I expect heat me

159
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,689
as someone who has received thousands
hate mails are I'm envious

160
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,810
beautiful beautiful hate mails arm

161
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,230
including description descriptions of
what might descriptions of what the

162
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,680
outside of my house looked like

163
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,810
level um

164
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,600
what next be anyway so I E a

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,510
I can say that that you note the best
ones the ones

166
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,730
the ones with people don't make an
effort to hate you

167
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,430
just hating you you know we like you
pass a store in your like other stores

168
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:58,910
likely

169
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,319
like that's not really working out when
they go into

170
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,760
blistering detail that's what I liked
about that letter how

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,180
at the the phrase I will light was

172
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,510
asking why you chose to go down this
retarded Road

173
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,410
I just that level of like you and it was
it was like you started out really

174
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,589
strong

175
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,490
but then it was awful I'm angry

176
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,970
cuz its awful but you started out great

177
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,450
and now I hate you I

178
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,760
those are my favorites from

179
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,580
know you probably hear you as somebody
inning get you got your really good

180
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,430
blistering

181
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,540
hey email but you you've gotten feedback
I would think from

182
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,630
this is just me guessing you can tell me
where I'm wrong people who

183
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,300
used from for whom it was a nostalgic

184
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,570
trip through their childhood and people
for whom

185
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,010
it might as well have been are

186
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,550
you know up takes place in space on a
satellite for all that matters to them

187
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,360
the does it swing one way or another
that you've gotten from that

188
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,830
icon alive from both um most masa comida
con

189
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,140
don't seem to have really talked about
it as some as being stout XI so I must

190
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,220
be now

191
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,380
Sep but I am I I think fundamentally

192
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,790
it just as a setting rather than as as
historical area

193
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,900
just as a setting it's still very
compelling

194
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,820
so you you get drawn into this world by

195
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,839
DM friendly store owner and

196
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,130
yet Ryan just as you would have been am
has actually eighty

197
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,410
regards to whether not yet mister at
fort

198
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,610
at this point um I've summer you out a
scene would like the URL

199
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,779
to this game perhaps or unless you've
already played it or tried it

200
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,860
if you're people here played this game
actually oh nice nice job

201
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,029
okay um its it's a I believe it's got
accomplished digital that's right

202
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:02,360
so it's is a Canadian Way yes oh hono
you are scouts honor

203
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,750
dot com flash digital

204
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,800
that's right so you can download it

205
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,980
it its cross-platform its out for

206
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,640
its Olympics game it's a Windows game
it's a Mac in

207
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,110
sheep this is she this I and I wanted to
move on to this because this fascinates

208
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,040
me as well

209
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,270
it's a computer desktop it's actually
very much like an Amiga

210
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,540
and you click on it and you interface
with it and it'll play music and it came

211
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,160
out cross-platform the first day

212
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,410
and it works the same and you used a
variety of two

213
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,120
so this isn't just some like no like fan
fiction that some work done really hard

214
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,700
minutes was full application that works
solid

215
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,770
you know that's that's the way these
things need to be

216
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,699
and so yes you got your Linux thing in
your liking are not going to play this

217
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:50,950
thing

218
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,990
you can you can play it right there so

219
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,520
I remember you mention which tools to
use which tool did you use to put

220
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,079
together

221
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,120
I'm its built-in official novel and done
from Japanese official novels called

222
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,470
ran P&A to sit and discuss I'm very
familiar with it but a

223
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,950
its so extensively modified about
halfway through I realize this was a

224
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,430
terrible terrible idea

225
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,100
across kept going to our tix at that
point is far too late to change

226
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,680
say you get a lot of sorta all i'd the
interface quirks like up the windows you

227
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,770
can't drag them if nothing

228
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,529
big but so eat it's an engine it's not
quite

229
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,890
meant for what it's doing as a result it
is now

230
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,949
I I mean the

231
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,529
a that like I said the interface is
extremely

232
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,790
I mean get you can't drag windows and
you forget that about two seconds and

233
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,779
lastly

234
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,529
but you know the fact that there's
applications you're installing

235
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:50,189
applications to make things work

236
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,360
you know just and and so

237
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,080
I think it was like the telly question
here and to say I thought that your

238
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,680
your the completeness of your package
was work that's part of what makes it

239
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,089
good

240
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,440
because I mean you could have done just
fanfiction

241
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,680
I've got some fan fiction written by

242
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,899
some guys in the early nineteen nineties
reimagining

243
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:15,420
the era love the Legion of Doom from the
80's

244
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,470
but that is writing stories they're not
creating

245
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,770
narrative mystery a so on why I think
the immersion is just that much more

246
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,399
interesting so otherwise I mean

247
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,100
a mystery game you can just have

248
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,870
watch someone solve a mystery but that's
not nearly as fun as

249
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,380
feeling like you're starving yourself
and to get into

250
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,270
to read about this world is one thing
but to actually be thrown into it

251
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,120
that such a rocket that that gets you
into a I think much more than any am

252
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,470
pros could so whether any particular
text files

253
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,740
oMG in your research that really stood
out to you

254
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,060
as inspirations I can't see any one
particular

255
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm a prop in any one particular back i
cant

256
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
think titles now I'm I mean I went drama

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,180
you have a section that that's just like
people recounting their entire histories

258
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,500
and I thought that was some

259
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,920
does could just get a feel from what
sort of I'm hacking mechanics would be a

260
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,470
bit

261
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,709
over the top in white Fordham what would
feel right hmm

262
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,120
and then I am I just read a lot of
absolute shock post

263
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,690
just like dick pic the messages section
oh yes

264
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,100
yeah yet is that the section on textile
to calm

265
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,560
which is just messages just masses of
messages

266
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,290
and I have used that to settle more
arguments over the years I mean it's

267
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,240
crap right mm literally just

268
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,019
scanning old printouts and getting print
out some other people

269
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,080
I am I have printouts from the first BBS

270
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,850
I'm printed out a month after it started
and people

271
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,529
one guy is chatting with somebody in
says K 00 L to him

272
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,980
and that's 1978 so fuck you historian to
tommy was 1995

273
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,040
the guy there's a guy and I'm sorry I'm
forgetting his name right now he's a

274
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,140
crumb Marion

275
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,589
and people keep pointing me to him
because he

276
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,630
will occasionally because named grant
something he's a columnist

277
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,709
a used to be important port systems and
he will occasionally wooot

278
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:19,060
that was what got it it was a huge
argument over where did the word won't

279
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,560
come together an

280
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,779
and somebody wanted me to come along and
just nutsack in with a ninety-eight 1982

281
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,570
reference be let's play before you even
understand it

282
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,820
but it turned out that it really does
look like it's from

283
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,680
who there it is like if you trace it
back I'm sorry to say

284
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,630
yup woop there it is um

285
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:48,040
this was the town that dreaded whirlpool
let's not go there um I

286
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,510
how so um you know

287
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,650
there's always this kinda love %uh like
trade little berry

288
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,300
jams in these messages that I i mean i
you know

289
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,640
arm for instance using messages this
there's a case I always give this one is

290
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,879
a politics board

291
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,880
and somebody says let's discuss politics
which now would be like

292
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,829
strap in you know explosives years of I

293
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,399
you know if you just set up let's talk
about politics

294
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,040
man 14 minutes later you are like so

295
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,670
there someone does it and people engage
in a conversation with politics its

296
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,880
stunted and childish and stupid you know
mondale sucks

297
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,860
and so on but it's 64 messages and it
took

298
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,720
two and a half months soul

299
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,820
you realized that people are responding
to each other four days

300
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,450
after the previous guy and its sole
glacial

301
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,940
and slow and get now

302
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,960
you can have those kinda conversations
if you post something on fark

303
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,880
in fact on fark you don't even need to
have the subject be about what you're

304
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,800
talking about to europe

305
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,919
you know %uh Metafilter is suffering
through this right now trying to produce

306
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,800
they've produced a whole set of terms
you know this thread jacking thread

307
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,370
shooting

308
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,890
om with their just saying like yours
behavior that we now know it's not

309
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,340
it's not good for you were talking about
cars and one of the guys has a political

310
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,340
stickers lights suddenly start talking
about his political sticker

311
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,530
you're ruining the conversation it's not
precious

312
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:29,639
it doesn't help mom the bottom port
system printouts

313
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,640
are the ones I really like homered you
capture you found these with the trades

314
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,420
discussions the wearer's treating your

315
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,679
where the guy shows up and says I've got
cuts are gone

316
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,300
3 I and so on

317
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,620
and and and there's a bit of that arm
you

318
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,720
you you wrote some very nice
introductions to different kinds of

319
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,210
you know you you give the audience some
me and the players something Tendo like

320
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,260
instruction so that you cannot you know
and you don't feel embarrassed about it

321
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,280
to someone posted a message in it just
happens to tell you everything you need

322
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,550
the you be afraid to ask was that 4

323
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,740
you was that specifically because you
will reach your audience was gonna have

324
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,230
no idea where they were

325
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,650
up part of it but part of it is I think
other

326
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,810
that that the player as as a character
in this some being flying into this

327
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,320
mysterious world

328
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,580
some beat some instruction so and

329
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,210
did the best we introduce game gameplay
mechanics is to explain them seamlessly

330
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,520
its best ways to just %uh have someone

331
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,429
in the story tell you had to do
something

332
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:41,929
and you feel like you've learned
something rather use Android tutorial um

333
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:48,590
whether any a ideas you would consider
that you ended up not going with

334
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,870
like either because they were too big or
it turned out they didn't fit

335
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,160
arm to the whole story was on when
winter

336
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,510
number revisions but the most notable on

337
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,780
absence was a third there are a lot of
gameplay mechanics are taken from a

338
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,820
and and nineties game called uplink
which is a

339
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,070
very fun um gap

340
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,090
with some uplink fans in the audience I
hope so I'd love up like it but it in

341
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,310
some a computer could you call out for
Activision Thacker come on come on

342
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,530
I Jesus alright

343
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,639
I find fuck you guys I made a there was
a game called

344
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,200
Activision hacker by Activision it's
awful arm

345
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,340
what I liked about it was that you could
tell

346
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,330
this is the thinking I when it starts
out it its post to have

347
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,678
um

348
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,780
I'm thinking love Mirror's Edge where I
played three demos ovett

349
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,240
like I hope they stick you in the middle
of fuckin nowhere

350
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,169
with nothin and you gotta figure shit
out

351
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,620
now there are only a certain subset of
gamers who would like that

352
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,590
okay yeah exactly

353
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,750
the opening love one up in chanter

354
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:11,750
I believe it is which is it is dark your
fraught spell most one of in the evening

355
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,510
kid on a modified I well

356
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,150
hacker opened with the propped the idea
being you had

357
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,500
hackear you had to figure out what the
password was to get through

358
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,260
except that if you got the password like
four times and go are you sure it isn't

359
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,730
this password

360
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,970
and it had a buncha that never happened
to me in the old days

361
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,410
although guest guest did work an awful
lot arm

362
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,850
but anyway so talking Activision packard
few good

363
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,850
feel free to pirate it cuz you know I I
fully endorse it thank you

364
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,090
I am Bayway so just

365
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,540
so weak if you plead Sea Fleet uplink

366
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,899
as a pretty you bumped into this game I

367
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,230
yeah mock not freeze in a couple years
ago but

368
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,500
okay just okay I thought you meant you
played it in the nineties

369
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,770
or you're just actually literally like
going back in don't like but about this

370
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,340
came about this K

371
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,449
up vol plaintiff years ago and I was
inspired by

372
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,830
and finally I got around to making
something inspired by it

373
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,980
but I'd not there there are a lot of a
case that were initially from it they're

374
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,400
still

375
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,400
one there remains in there which is a
master goofy and dictionary hacker tool

376
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,710
but the rest the bomb II

377
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,950
they got streamlined out ok sam and as a
result it becomes a lot simpler

378
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,380
I'm even know the hacking mechanics are
obviously ridiculous

379
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,200
don't do not they don't correspond to
anything really do

380
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,220
a rather they correspond but they don't
represented

381
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,410
no but as a result you instead he spent
most the time talking to people

382
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,490
most I'm reading message it's and I
think

383
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,040
anything to change the folks at the game
much for the better

384
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,740
7 hacking about hacking attacking about
a

385
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,840
talking to people investigating

386
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,250
solving puzzles in a

387
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,590
fairly simple way migrate

388
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,918
I you know the the thing that I as a
person for me the most

389
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,280
on the reason I did documentaries was
because I said that

390
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,678
that the text files at the bones you
know

391
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,900
you could go through the bones but you
never gonna find out how what a great

392
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,380
time

393
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,990
was hanging out with that person you
just gonna know that

394
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,090
they were probably six-foot-two and

395
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,320
you'll know how many times a person
posted in all know what they tended to

396
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,300
post about but you won't find out like
but they were feeling when they were

397
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,640
going through it

398
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,820
so that's why did documentary was to
talk to people about organic thing

399
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,550
and in your in your

400
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,210
story I'm working very hard to not give
spoilers Celtic that's fair

401
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,260
I think you should try definitely try to
but

402
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,860
you know it's a case if you come to
learn about people you interact with

403
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,740
relationships and talk to people

404
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,540
all along with and I like this there's a
lot of red herring

405
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,240
initially because you just kinda reading
a lot of messages people dislike

406
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,950
I'm an idiot and you like why am I
reading this and then something to go

407
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,350
buying

408
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,530
weekly yeah and that's

409
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,280
you know sifting through clues arm

410
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,399
there's a very old set up books they got
reprinted four times

411
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,300
%uh I think the cat reprinted in the
nineties on if you look for

412
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,440
the title murder of Miami

413
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,970
um this is a set a box that created my
mid-nineteen thirty's by JP links

414
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,679
and what they are is there dossiers and
when you pick them up

415
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,370
it is literally a pile of police report

416
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,380
and pictures and stories

417
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,690
and it's really you know it's got its
own little feel to it

418
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,600
and then at the end of it there's a
sealed envelope

419
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,179
and the sealed envelope shows what

420
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:59,460
the the person the investigator
alternately did

421
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,600
when faced with this dossier so you are
too

422
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,909
open it up and it actually was inspired
infocomm to include

423
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:09,580
items in their boxes this beautiful
piece and it's very similar to what you

424
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,928
have here this mechanic of

425
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,950
I'm going to live through here boat
what's going on there

426
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,030
what's happening here that you know the

427
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,030
have you head I didn't I miss are you

428
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,800
this is obviously not your only project
you've done a bunch of

429
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,010
writing and a bunch of mom

430
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,129
other projects was there anything else
that kind of work

431
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,790
free version of this a dry run the
version we like I could do this even

432
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,540
better and you end up with this year's

433
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,270
this your first foray into this no i i
think this really is my driving here

434
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:42,929
before

435
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:46,030
my mostly done a lot of pros a lot of
them

436
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,270
I did do one game that was some its
browser-based mister Obama

437
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,360
about fighting games all done and I'm

438
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,770
that as a servant turn based game which
is

439
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,810
a IVC barium seems very

440
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,149
on concept but the Saints are many
fictional thing

441
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,190
at but that's the closest thing I've
ever done to anything other industry to

442
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,280
produce

443
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,520
are you inspired to do another one
absolutely at

444
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,908
I've been trying and I'm not going to
rush it I'm not gonna

445
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,070
force it that site more the second one
is a musical

446
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,220
thats that's what traditionally do the
second to music

447
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,669
laugh it up that i'm gonna do now
everyone heard it here first

448
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,760
musical 0 get some hire some singers get
some people get some people

449
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,310
man a bigger digital to on ice

450
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,889
I would totally go for a PBS musical

451
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:43,980
I waiting for the dial tone

452
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,639
the two piano pieces your team I

453
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,919
its busy hits busy

454
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,260
its busy why am I here

455
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,320
my record there was a baltimore system
located about

456
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,810
I wanna say six 50 miles north the here
call to share what forced to

457
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,370
and it was something like

458
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,510
on average it would take me between 30
and 40

459
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,658
hours have dialing to get into it

460
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,760
and so when I got on I would just take
massive amounts um

461
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,860
copies of every single thing on the
board because

462
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,960
I was gonna get on again for days and so
I have

463
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,540
a lot of what they had ran it just have
it up as whatever and just recently

464
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,260
actually buddy

465
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,790
six or seven months ago I was contacted
by the cop the came along with the

466
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,389
Federal guys who busted

467
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,210
Cybertron

468
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,310
not now show forced to they knew each
other those guys home now

469
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,940
yet sure forced to shower forced 3 the
nose ohs any

470
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,389
but also he was a separate they have
interview that sysop

471
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,520
he's out in california the school shit

472
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,100
and his sis up name was sysop houses

473
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,139
for that huber's and um

474
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:07,480
anyway so it's ok there were you know
arm

475
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,130
was a going with time was awesome

476
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,530
bit baby I we saw the cop the whole
point is that I'm trying to get like the

477
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,750
other story from the other side

478
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,159
up that particular com

479
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,340
event because I did you have the story
from the guys who had it taken down

480
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,570
but I think it's worthwhile arm there's
a

481
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,240
view if you guys attended Phil actually
stalks before

482
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,179
um fill-ups Lee was a guy who I bumped
into who's been working on a book

483
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:39,880
on the history of phone freaking and his
defend and and coming from me the guy

484
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,419
with the

485
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,500
seven and a half hour documentary in
Baltimore systems

486
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,760
%ah he's doing it right okay

487
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,960
he's filed hundreds and hundreds a
Freedom of Information Act requests is

488
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,840
giving a talk on how we did it

489
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,659
and he's been talking about history plot

490
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:59,970
it's not just about to phone phreaks
going here were awesome

491
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,860
and it's not just a bunch of law
enforcement guys gone fuck those guys

492
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,409
they were of

493
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,570
its everybody that's all we can get the
story

494
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,689
you can't like everybody in the history
can't be

495
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,810
one piece or another to going back to
your your work here

496
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,750
arm how long did you work on

497
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm I'll alt well actually I'm making
the game from start to finish it took

498
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,540
about a month

499
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,760
II this was intentional deadline I'm

500
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,330
me if I give myself if I don't set 1 I'd
10+2

501
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,820
to work on time for two weeks and then
forget about it for ever so I said

502
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,870
one month and a hoelter

503
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,690
it plays like a game that was not
created

504
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,000
month say that very smooth I mean

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,300
was at work every day you know every up
yes yes definitely

506
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,770
okay so it's hours of work each day
hours a programming and during the first

507
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,830
couple weeks it was also

508
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:00,389
hours a to Sri in three on them archived
a

509
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:05,060
Redrum files on your site just am
especially and even during and when I

510
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,889
was trying to nail

511
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,950
was writing messages and try and nail
people's voices

512
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,290
despite just like every impulse and
their based on them

513
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,918
the race to a real person X I want to
get them

514
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,270
I did like it if your cracked like

515
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:23,200
I think did a great job so once again
it's a Scout's honor

516
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,970
80 Nour dot com slash digital to very
small program

517
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,669
and includes chiptune music as an
optional background

518
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:36,530
which adds a nice feel to it but it's
optional you can turn it off

519
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,399
so and and and some really good some
really good music

520
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,480
there from thank you for your comments
yeah I S rates release Creative Commons

521
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,120
crack

522
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,290
yeah I so um

523
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:53,300
the guy either he is offering me at my
limo right but we have 10 minutes so

524
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,250
mom if there's some questions from the
audience if you want to come up

525
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,649
and if there was anything you want to
ask Christina myself

526
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:05,110
about anything don't be afraid they were
there for a reason

527
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,370
but in while people work up to the
gallbladder to do it

528
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:15,370
up there we go

529
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,400
I E off to the side that a lot of arm
but that'll be one of those things that

530
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,880
when

531
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,740
just implemented I figured that a player
probably wooden

532
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,550
feed very interested in them seem to
have a busy signal is as much that was

533
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,060
obviously a comport

534
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,690
part of a actually calling PBS's

535
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:43,150
and similar rally speeds again it's I
don't i cant think I've anyway implement

536
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,580
that

537
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,010
that would just be frustrating both
boards to go down

538
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,390
so you lose avenues

539
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,890
%uh of exploration and I agree the
problem is

540
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,230
you know how do you feel how deep a
trade that the time is long and boring

541
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,770
you try not to do it by having the time
be long and boring in now

542
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,070
that's kind of a you know you have
things kinda fade out fade back

543
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,110
as like man that was long and boring and
fun

544
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:13,730
next thing get them work in movies
either doesn't um

545
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:19,810
any other questions along with optional
turned on microphone that

546
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,060
maybe now you

547
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,740
their guns love my voice so workaround
on

548
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,210
so having played through it and having a
bunch of friends have played through

549
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,880
one comment that keeps coming up again
and again animus

550
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,250
oil little bit of the device not the
plot

551
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,150
k step carefully is I you

552
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,450
get these messages and then you hit
reply and then you get responses back

553
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,330
by you never see white you wrote mom

554
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,870
and so does feels like you have a
monologue coming at you

555
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,870
but you can only ever see half it now is
wondering I mean was that intentional

556
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,820
was that

557
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,040
something that you chose very actively
when you're designing the game it is to

558
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,639
some some

559
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,070
he was figuring out that that the game I

560
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,030
I want to do something sir story for a
while but it took me awhile to figure

561
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,530
out what would make it work

562
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,510
eventually figured out with us our
protagonist you don't see what you're

563
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:15,970
writing

564
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,540
so it doesn't break immersion as much as
a fam

565
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,780
you would say see your response is a wat

566
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,050
I'm when say something like that's not
right at all

567
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,520
instead you you have to fill it in and a

568
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,450
it's very and most a response or
ambiguous enough that he

569
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,950
hopefully it fits you want to put
whatever you actually were gonna ask

570
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,830
CS it was amused is a deliberate effort
to not break the immersion

571
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,840
there has been some debate and I think
Emily

572
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,900
short wrote a bit of a prototype huge
thing and have short does a lot of

573
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,090
reviews have attracted fiction and so on
reviewed

574
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,340
digital a love story and discuss that
exact mechanic

575
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,530
yep blew me away more than anything she
comments about how she normally doesn't

576
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,180
like a

577
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,650
games with interstate characters but in
this case it actually first

578
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,790
cuz ive expecting us to and I agree with
her

579
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,168
first point completely normally I find
him the plant for taking us to be

580
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:12,020
extremely

581
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,149
more plant might buy actually putting
you insist but I think its last seven

582
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:20,040
and think tanks in this case more but
just the second person there

583
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,320
which for me it was a relief a look ok I
don't have to think about anything

584
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,530
on that end you know I'm like I wish I
could do that in real life

585
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:34,270
person tells me and I'm like hit K I'm
sure I said something Brouillette the

586
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,969
press respect Kyle you give me so well

587
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,340
like I back to my gape

588
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,159
respond it when nope didn't know about
the chili

589
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,200
a chil I feature in new Dora

590
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,450
which they created years and years ago
the plugin

591
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,449
it would look at your language and would
respond and say basically

592
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:01,960
you seem to be pretty angry hit this
button

593
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,270
and I will hold it for 30 minutes and
bring it back to you

594
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,210
and by that point your your your

595
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,930
your blood pressure goes down it'll show
it to you get your

596
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,270
did you really want to send their and
then you gotta fuck that guy

597
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,870
I I keep that going for hours if I keep
my hatred burning for

598
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,310
years I've had people talking to me to
the Hopi still angry normally a V-chip

599
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,380
um but that was the case with they are

600
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,640
you know trying to augment your
brilliance with it and and for me

601
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,690
it was such a load of to not be

602
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:43,280
thinking I'm gonna have to play the
guess the word problem

603
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,480
where person says something else I have
to write an email

604
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,800
in which the word password is it

605
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,810
otherwise I can't get past this part

606
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,310
you know and it's still very media me
there's still a lot to go through

607
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,150
so um any other questions by the way

608
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,550
I we go right up ahead

609
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,260
that one sucks I don't know what's up
with that one I will repeat your

610
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,580
question

611
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,370
%uh just curious know the area i was
just curious as to why

612
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,380
Tom you chose to base om

613
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,109
based the story around the may get OS as
opposed to

614
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:22,250
om some the other systems around time

615
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,270
how I can't resist it's just very

616
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,509
distinctive I and me its dead that the
county blew up

617
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,910
the original work benches its

618
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,680
very memorable and also on it helps
contribute to the mood a lot I think

619
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,819
just having some sort of them

620
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,390
certified dreary blue interface you go
to ram

621
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,609
it he couldn't based on something else I
can Syria

622
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:49,640
making a calmer 64 you still has the

623
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,700
original script I'm up next spring is
based on c64 but now I I thought

624
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,210
it needed color it need it to tap that

625
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,870
self MEC natural

626
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,569
yeah it's a very beautiful work so um

627
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,690
mythic if there's any other last
question to ask um

628
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,800
so so obvious be deterred

629
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,320
a softball question but you appear to
have been pretty happy

630
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,440
at the upcoming this particular work
right

631
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,180
I yeah I'd say so your so um

632
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,970
do you think a bit as aside thing you do

633
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,390
to other main work you do or do you see
a possible future in that

634
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,470
in game writing in games in stories told
that way

635
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,830
what is clearly a very big audience for
some I'm which

636
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,180
continue to surprise me but and i win

637
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,720
I'm definitely in for to making
something I am again many along those

638
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,710
lines maybe not but

639
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,950
but between selling yes I think its some
not

640
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:58,990
devalued about simple prose I I think
this

641
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:03,600
I certainly like I writing novel still
but i i think it's a

642
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,759
yeah it's definitely fascinating just
having on my chest him play with them

643
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,370
to meet certain areas said to him to him
to immerse the player

644
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,870
rather than simply M telling a story

645
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,560
well I hope we get many more a few what
