1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:05,089
discussion that the command module a
service model the Polish spacecraft did

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:05,919
not fly

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,950
has 105 Boozer the Saturn 5 booster had
its own independent computer system

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,849
I was developed by IBM nobody talks that
because it is a very boring

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:15,910
conservatives

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,450
you know traditional am computer but

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,450
it was the one that was in charge of
getting Saturn 5

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,450
aligned till pitch roll although I kinda

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,160
good stuff so we get into orbit so when
you hear people talking about

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,470
%uh the command module is dead they
worry that was command much a crippled

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,269
the problem how the problem was that the
Saturn 5 am

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,810
computer was perfectly happy going to
orbit it didn't care if there was a big

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,230
paperweight on the top

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,810
the rocket it was going to orbit and so
that was the issue as well

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,600
do we stay for the ride am so Apollo 12

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,620
now was see the second

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,880
and moon landing and it had a fairly

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,079
veteran I started something kinda we're
have to it so this is this is the crown

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,839
to her transmission and this is what the
world her if you're listening in on nasa

20
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,710
channel this is the chat back between

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,090
the astronauts look at the Public
Affairs officials

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,040
you'll hear the am the Capcom who is the
only person on the ground who is about

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,050
to talk to the

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,960
astronauts I also hear some my ring at
certain point because I believe this

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,870
tapers from the honeysuckle Creek in
Australia where

26
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,880
ass with the engineers actually work
speed improvement on the mic picked up

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,110
to sound sorts

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,080
play this this whole incident only talk
about 23 minutes

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,080
thaaaat throw-in

30
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,820
favorite reporter or Thor

31
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,759
file

32
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,759
for ask for a second for a hard worker

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,620
yeah 592

34
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:34,510
for ass ass

35
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,970
for crack cocaine fact or crap

36
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,020
what happened here we get a hacer

37
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,430
proctor perform

38
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,430
fast

39
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,980
the

40
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,540
how hard rockers ferry over

41
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,459
for yeah

42
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,459
car

43
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,410
recovery 3 for Park

44
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,579
Charlie the pre-match go on to orbit and
after that and this goes on

45
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,080
they do some clean-up get a successful
staging sorry

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,550
well yeah terms with the confusion so

47
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,840
so that's what you heard you had a long
silence

48
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,190
pass people and this is however this is
a ground loop conversation so

49
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,920
is a little harder to make up the OU
because we're listening to is an overlay

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,700
up the ass not stocking you also
listening out for

51
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,750
the flight director talking to e.com

52
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,300
and the e-commerce a mission control in
charge of the environmental

53
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,420
and I he electronic environmental an

54
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,570
problems one point is also charged
communications but I'm a separate app to

55
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,690
cap the name same

56
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,829
and you sure kentucky come in most
importantly

57
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,029
you hear him talking a little bit his
backroom boys

58
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,720
and so the way mission control
structures you see that very classic in

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,000
all the guys in front of their

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,550
raise the council's each one of those if
you were to go out the door and turn

61
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:31,940
right

62
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,300
there many many other rooms remind had
CF

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,590
dei comes in is his counsel and hit
three or four guys who also had very

64
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,930
similar councils looking at very
specific subsystems

65
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,790
after times they were Chatham cells on
the loop before they would maybe

66
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,730
go back to talk to fly tractors a is a
little bit angled and but I think you'll

67
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,020
get

68
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,289
you'll get the sense for the world

69
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,900
so this this is this the the actual
transcripts from that

70
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,000
finish controllers face process thanks I

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,020
Asmar

72
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:16,020
fish ass ass

73
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,560
ass

74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,560
thanks fast far

75
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,889
yeah fast

76
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:44,889
I got thaaaat like ass the

77
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,490
FAA for I don't know if johnnie feet of

78
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,080
say can't yeah of thingy to of

79
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,229
5 s C-dot kept out cellmark out here
said try a half

80
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:12,430
free a few of carry-over three

81
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,110
freehoff for cutbacks

82
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,690
50 fast and that's it

83
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,620
faces a mission am so what is happening
there was

84
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,640
laws the magic switch sc2 Fox

85
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,770
very clearly that wasn't common command
and now we really knew what it was but

86
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,460
but a couple things when on here one
defy controller

87
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,669
and it was a guy called them so 70 S E
1st so the SE is a p/e is what's known

88
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,020
as a signal conditioning

89
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,669
equipment and the Apollo missions were
very heavily instrumented

90
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:52,299
and a lot of problems they had to redo
to instrumentation problems but you get

91
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,039
all the signals you know from that

92
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,919
heater palm frond radar all these
instruments come through

93
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,430
they all have to be am normalized into a

94
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,789
standard range voltages says one they
can be displayed

95
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,800
inside the cockpit and to see that can
be sent back down

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,360
the radio feed am so what happened last

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,990
that when a lightning strike happened
all those fuel cells in the service

98
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,330
models I mentioned

99
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,450
at checked off and so the the

100
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,840
command the command module is drawing
power from a couple batteries

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,030
there are really only meant for reentry
and their emergency situations and if

102
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,590
you read the polls 13-story became all
about

103
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,490
an section of attacking became very much
in managing

104
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,020
those patch users but the problem is
that when I went to those batteries

105
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,210
divulges dropped below the SC normally
use

106
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,250
and there's little switch down how

107
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,970
that switching to exit a remote which
was not in the procedures it was kinda

108
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,550
their

109
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,610
holmes is a legacy issue from from tram
from how he built equipment

110
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,020
and that said whatever kinda crappy she
devoted you have gold

111
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,200
and and when they did that they got back
to name a tree

112
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,810
also that displays began you reading
meaningful results they could see

113
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,479
not that they have the entire command
module mounting down but that they had

114
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,460
3 disconnected fuel cells am so the man
who made that call the who recognized

115
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,320
the SE problem with this guy called John

116
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,960
Arran and he's also very important in
apollo thirteen in different ways

117
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,640
but at the time this incident made him
like the original steely eyed

118
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,120
missile and the reason he was able to
recognize that collin nobody else

119
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,929
could've made was because a yearly
earlier and a Pap test

120
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,329
he had seen this result and that's a
test guy had made a mistake of the

121
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,180
command module

122
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,010
the SEO thinking at these screwy
readings he knew they were screwy

123
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,370
readings because he owed

124
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,339
DBS certain piece of equipment that only
day he knew would only operate between

125
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:50,820
twelve and twenty eight full-service
reporting six-foot

126
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,589
was very distinct pattern scrimmage has
like you know sometimes if you look at

127
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:56,120
your

128
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,500
you get a blue screen of death and
actually and all those numbers appear

129
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,670
he was a guy actually look at those
numbers and realize exactly

130
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,469
what they meant am so in a sense you
might think well this is

131
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,150
of the lucky and really really was lucky
but it does speak to the culture

132
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,420
of Mission Control at time where these
guys went through every system

133
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,050
under said systems they were deeply
involved in developing operations from

134
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,450
there

135
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,360
deeply involved in talks with the
engineers who built them neon D-day

136
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,620
each with his car had man's death a
technical matters built up over years in

137
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,390
simulations

138
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,530
and the notice when he actually made the
call for sake checks

139
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,339
backroom guises do you think it's the SE
they don't know what the hell is

140
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,760
and he comes back and says flight
instantly flight try as he hugs ily

141
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,790
he has confidence to me to call the heat
but he thinks he sees

142
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,980
is when he sees I spoke to gene krantz
about this about how you take

143
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,579
this flight controllers men in their 20s
right on to college

144
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:56,180
how you get a guy to that particular
point we can make that call

145
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,630
this is well it took about a year to 18
months to make a flight controller you

146
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,550
start them off

147
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,360
gathering information do very simple
task adding information manufactures

148
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,370
helping the flight controllers built and
procedures isn't Asian

149
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,470
and you put them through simulation for
simulation simulation

150
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,709
and the thing that would wipe out flight
controller was that they wouldn't have

151
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,350
that level of confidence

152
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,670
required a certain level arrogance and
require certain level just go for it

153
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,829
and John armoires possibly pick me aback

154
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,760
really understand all the systems and he
has unshakable confidence

155
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,209
and later on again it's nice but how 13
we'll be talking about he developed

156
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,069
devices para sequence

157
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:37,219
at the Astros hat entry and without
inner-city are they had to turn off the

158
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,030
instrumentation

159
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,569
i would tell them if they're making
steaks or not see happen radio up this

160
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:42,459
checklist

161
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,280
in which the Astros hat entrant
perfectly first time after being awake

162
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,350
for days with me

163
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,350
your tract infection and he made a call
he had no problem with that at the time

164
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,199
years later an older man limb more
reflective

165
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:58,470
he still has nightmares bash because of
how risky

166
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,760
tax procedure am but at the time you
know

167
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,270
you need these cokie eyes who work
confident but not overconfident

168
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,300
so that was John R do you think I should
say that was soon as he made the call

169
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,230
notice how the flight controller who is
no idea what what's going on

170
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,530
goes well okay john and he tells the
Capcom I get synced up they had trust

171
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,800
they believed it really trained each
other

172
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,900
they rely on each other that's an
engineering culture

173
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,110
that is prime for success increase lean
years nasa pending trades

174
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,829
you know culture issues but anybody
who's involved in high-risk high-tech

175
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,630
enterprise concern

176
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,900
what these guys it so Paul 13 which is a
very famous

177
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,640
all kinds attacks in apollo thirteen
answer famous one there

178
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,089
pains get a carbon dioxide filters with
choc am recharging the command module

179
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,660
from the batteries now I'm

180
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,790
to meet all seen the movie am that
actual thing

181
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,110
of recharge T module from the command
module

182
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,670
to Mamata from the lunar module I was
actually something that was

183
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,910
had to have been working on for several
months previously am

184
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,089
ezel image before scriptures again be
thinking about that for some time

185
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:10,400
even the Mersey activation checklist
they already had a kind of a dummy

186
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,040
situation for these are all great pretty
good hacks and actually the carbon

187
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,280
dioxide filter issue again they had

188
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,839
then maybe twenty four hours to work on
that was never the ass just never really

189
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,120
broke a sweat about that

190
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,430
cousin you people working on the new
solution the actual kinda bit late in

191
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,120
the day

192
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,370
money put it together has had other
things on her mind thought this was a

193
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,220
lower priority I

194
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,600
all those richter him good hacks hacker
really wanna talk about this is among

195
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,640
his interview on

196
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,870
was turning me on to mind first place
I'm not talking about the activation

197
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,120
checklist which is

198
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,930
you know we turn on this benefit in the
sequence in again no your platform

199
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,449
lined up the simple act up during the
Lunar Module

200
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,140
from again a paperweight into a
functioning spaceship

201
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,360
requires power there is no way to turn
the lunar module

202
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,780
on when the Apollo 13's fuel cells

203
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,380
explode actually the auction tank
exploded

204
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,829
knocked off the fuel cells and

205
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,970
what happened at mission last apollo
thirteen service module

206
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,870
there was an axe there's an explosion
action tank fuel cells died

207
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,730
very quickly the command module was
running on those reserves backup

208
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,520
batteries

209
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,350
parallel systems couldn't do that and
they had a ready search shutting down

210
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,400
systems am in the command module

211
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,600
to the command marge was very little
power and mister to have this

212
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,439
for huge knock-on problem for the Lunar
Module the reason is this

213
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,420
so these are the lunar module activation
checklist

214
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,520
am I got this wrong with anybody really
cares that their module

215
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,400
there's the cradle aviation up on Long
Island has the Roman

216
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,510
archive so if you wanted to build your
own your module

217
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,130
most if it is in there and you can go up
in you can go to Emanuel's

218
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,810
this actually can also get online so
this is the official activation

219
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,170
checklist which

220
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,000
again was cut down very much shortened
but notice the first

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,040
assumption made the CSM has initiated
para transferir

222
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,050
be a docking tunnel actual umbilicals so
the very first assumption is now invalid

223
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,440
you could not perceive it anything on
the checklist because there is a false

224
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,510
assumption

225
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,089
the reason for that loss this simple
sketch

226
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:22,459
and actually the full version of things
as axis on this came on like three

227
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,579
gatefold the full version that is this
the overview the full detailed version

228
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,750
is

229
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:33,209
really be on beyond belief but so it's
divided to three parts you remember

230
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,540
the lunar module had the same stage

231
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,360
Sen stage on top and then it was
attached the command module for most

232
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,519
chip most check it was docked an to the
command module

233
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,850
so the descent stage in a bottle had
great big batteries lovely back trees

234
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,200
pollens what's up our

235
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,190
happily under marshal in order to get
those batteries activated to is

236
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,190
controlled by

237
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,660
junction box which is a powered relay
box see you could not get

238
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,230
sent factories on an issue it power to

239
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,209
junction box junction box got its power
from

240
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,350
home to an indelible from the command
module

241
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,990
so only way you could power the junction
box to turn on the descent

242
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,149
countries was be a switch in the command
module switch which had lost power

243
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,389
am

244
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,760
so why in her study designed to sway

245
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,839
why in god's name would you just have a
simple on-off switch

246
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,459
emergency switch captured hide it
somewhere it wouldn't matter will switch

247
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,089
took a turn on why in god's name would
you design a system

248
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:42,870
this way yeah so the answer is because
the batteries

249
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,209
and if you think back to technology
sucks today

250
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,480
have ish go back to 1963

251
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,630
are you 1932 even so the Apollo

252
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,649
systems used and zinc summer zinc
batteries

253
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:00,820
which were chemically activated the
lunar module excuse non-rechargeable

254
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,930
versions of these batteries they were
charged find their cab drivers time for

255
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,339
me she would fill them up with

256
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,269
electrolyte and they will be charged up
there was no recharging

257
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,959
you had a set amount ours so became very
much

258
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,920
had a lot of design decisions became at
conserving parents batteries

259
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,019
using them as little as possible am

260
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,920
hands D was up but because aged eight
and eight use everything

261
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,370
matches because everything patches are
very very energy dance

262
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,100
is actually some interest now and doing
a type-a servers it bashed

263
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,209
laptops and so on scooters lithium-ion
but

264
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,410
very transit dance very very heavy am

265
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,519
but one-shot comic so

266
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,399
there is also another weirdness so this
is that this is a schematic up to

267
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,690
descend batteries

268
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,470
again I got this from Long Island and

269
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,570
we'll see this works here

270
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,709
okay so there's actually two conductors
so the summer zinc batteries have this

271
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:58,670
weird

272
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,940
and when they did not give a constant
voltage

273
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,240
knows when you fully charged them up and
day produced

274
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,649
am 38 votes when they're fully charged

275
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:12,970
am them in the power went down the drop
down to 32 votes

276
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,490
am so what the walls in the descent
patches was there is attacked

277
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,109
happy 17 cells in which we just give you
the lower 32 voltage

278
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,250
and then the last batch was use low that
they would tap

279
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,669
so the full 20 cells within batteries
used and the reason to for doing this

280
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,889
was because he was certain equipment

281
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:34,980
in the command module and historian the
module I could not tolerate

282
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,250
38 folks specs top-rated 32 volts

283
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,540
relax so the same factories can control
them

284
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,790
junction box has magical voted switch
you needed to turn the lunar module

285
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,790
on otherwise would blow up important
things

286
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,120
that you would really want later on at
the ascent batteries

287
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,159
did not have this tack this and become
important

288
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,700
they only had it for you can only get
the start at 4:30 voters and up to 32

289
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,250
reason to get away with that because the
way the missions were sequenced the laws

290
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,389
were designed

291
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:08,570
by the time he had the ascent batteries
on you had enough for load

292
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,750
am that third

293
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,590
lower the full just drop enough to
damage them in the crypt

294
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,310
so you have this terrible problem three
and Apollo marshall the Confessor lunar

295
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,408
module I could not be turned on

296
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:26,980
am and that was truly was nowhere in the
procedures

297
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,870
and there are two guys were really
unsung heroes about this

298
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,360
am bob later and Bill Res Bob leather
sally has passed to a couple years ago

299
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,940
am I think bill resupply Phillies
eventually don't become a flight

300
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,060
director

301
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,780
and they had been sitting in their
little back room

302
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,330
and they had noticed that and so they
had a little paper trace

303
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,990
that was monitoring the five things at
the lunar module that were

304
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,030
damn lunar module normally

305
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,580
sorry for most of its flight by the
lunar module was docked the command

306
00:18:59,580 --> 00:18:59,949
module

307
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,100
was in a very low power mode he didn't
have lights flashing

308
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,830
exceeded me the power however there are
like a couple things like ears and

309
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,550
glycol

310
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,340
pumps incidents rotation handful
equipment you kept on throughout the

311
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,350
flight

312
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,840
when the apollo thirteen explosion
occurred

313
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,189
they saw altered all traces just go to
zero and they knew they had lost power

314
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,429
the command module at that moment they
knew they were going to have to find a

315
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,970
way to turn on

316
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,580
the lunar module without using any of
the command module

317
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,178
resources so this is you can see the
back injured more detailed map

318
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,270
they pulled is out in the back rooms are
going through them

319
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,480
and working out when you get there is a
anyway to turn

320
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,880
am the lunar module on

321
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,060
without before the astronauts died

322
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,408
so the solution they came up with walls
again so I can have to send stage the

323
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:50,960
junction box

324
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,050
I did mention he had his ascent
batteries but again the problem was

325
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,649
if you just connect to PSN factories to
the junction box

326
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,810
you were fried all these pieces of
equipment in use send module

327
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,149
because sent countries will start
pumping after Eagles

328
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,960
was just too high so what they did in
about half an hour's work out a whole

329
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,040
series a circuit breaker throws

330
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,168
which is to Paul every piece of
equipment that was going out of town 38

331
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:13,659
fills

332
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,750
of am become a lot of the line

333
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,980
they cut power cheese through the system
again with a more circuit polls

334
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,649
K get to get power to the junction box
they're able to power the junction box

335
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:30,520
to chat box turned on ap from there then
they were able to get the said pat is

336
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,379
turned on

337
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,429
and dissent that is set to low voltage
setting turn of dissent actors

338
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,550
and then they could begin the full
activation checklist

339
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,480
am the reason it was too is it was
served up this way was because

340
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,639
$27.5 a sitting on the pad it was
connected via launch in bilkul

341
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:50,030
which was providing parents those
handful of credit systems a little much

342
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,780
always here to be a just before launch
the

343
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,129
umbilical to send the signal to the
junction box which would turn the lunar

344
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,530
module

345
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,720
onto its internal battery power take off
at some point

346
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,440
the command module a dock with the lunar
module and then they would cut taxes and

347
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,389
bills

348
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:10,090
and the first thing you do it can build
consensus turn of descent actresses

349
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,939
junction box

350
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,720
so that in a much as be parents to the
fuel cells and so they were able to

351
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,780
basically back into this junction box

352
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,290
and get the same countries going and it
was talked about half an hour

353
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,820
this is really that see the one truly
see the pants thing happened apollo

354
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,629
thirteen

355
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,120
and very much is a thing that saves does
acids to hang on the lunar module on

356
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,679
all the other hand his stuff there you
know

357
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,970
waiting for them to come down through
the city to the atmosphere

358
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,120
know that would happen if the old so

359
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,750
last great hack power 14th and

360
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,860
every fifth nineteen seventy-one so now
you have a situation where

361
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,649
and everything this time has gone pretty
well and actually gone to the moon

362
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:57,280
the astronauts are

363
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,060
have transferred over to the lunar
module to descend to the surface they've

364
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,970
separated from the command module

365
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,350
another I can basically a parking permit
an

366
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,290
going around so then how our mission
controllers is something funny

367
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:16,010
am what happened also this is a little
schematic up up the lunar module

368
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,460
and there's a Pam from the guns

369
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,760
command panel looks like this and there
was a

370
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,200
teacher to wearing the incident with
this particular switch

371
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,929
which is the abort switch at which is a
very bad switch to have a runny noses to

372
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,129
as a port is a port stage so the idea
being that if you were

373
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:40,330
say you're coming down towards their
surface and you discovered your descent

374
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,220
stage scrappy of whatever reason you
could punch Fort stage

375
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,889
which sever the connections immediate
right who's the scent

376
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:51,740
at stage back up into orbit am

377
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,290
a portrait is a general which means time

378
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,490
am the problem was that there was a
little

379
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,629
Paulus older had come loose inside that
switch I was floating around its your

380
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:03,609
gravity

381
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:08,240
every now and then he would tip contacts
and the guys who are paying attention to

382
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,609
the

383
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:11,780
to the two to the measure would see
abort

384
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,730
come up on their screens fortunately the
lunar module's computer was in a mode

385
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,070
that

386
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:22,040
was not paying attention to a Forbes I

387
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,470
so the hand at the Hope Center most had
it set so if you're just

388
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,470
if you just like flying along I V in
orbit you don't really need to pay

389
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,230
attention

390
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,129
to something that only is going to take
place during a descent stage

391
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:38,159
am an ASI ASI my you pressing the A four
button

392
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,820
there's no and they said extra attacking
you

393
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,899
and a they tapped on the poor little
thing went away cuz it not the solar

394
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:49,280
bonus great life because well you sure
tap nicely

395
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,520
now so but they had this problem that at
any moment during the descent this

396
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,820
little slower ball

397
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,210
could move around and have triggered an
abort

398
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,359
which was kinda bad news church

399
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,250
so this all comes down to what's
involved here is the Apollo guidance

400
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,369
computer

401
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:11,780
am you for this audience

402
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,080
you cannot underestimate the
significance of this computer

403
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,689
people talk bad you know spin-offs from
nasa program

404
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,010
this computer wants essential they did
not invent

405
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,869
integrated circuits for this computer is
that they did not invent

406
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:30,000
know the computer the small computer

407
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,940
for this mission this mission this
computer

408
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,419
had so much have an impact on computing
act

409
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:40,869
and power the reason was because when
integrated circuits were first

410
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,280
introduced

411
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,590
an kilby in moist on the reston

412
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,428
an engineers hated them

413
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:54,000
despise them if you read the Nobel Prize
lecture of them

414
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,179
10 kilby who got you for men to the
internet through texas with

415
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,609
he says because provided the
entertainment a technical conferences

416
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,280
for several years

417
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,678
an engineers hated integrated circuits
for two reasons

418
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,530
one you have this back box have
previously their job loss if they were

419
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,780
building say oh I know

420
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,908
B 52 autopilot am

421
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:19,440
you would have resistors and capacitors
and transistors and you could measure

422
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,780
the characteristics of all those devices

423
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,668
individually and they get a fairly good
sense of how to work together

424
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,389
so any understood how to build those
circuits and then you're asking them

425
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:29,820
said

426
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,550
situation where you could test
individual each individual component

427
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,649
separately and have confidence in our
system as a result

428
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:40,340
here's a black box it works trust me

429
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,849
really hard to get people to like just
trust the damn things

430
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:47,418
the other issue with integrated circuits
and my head was

431
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,010
unreliable they did sometimes crap out

432
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,520
yields are low they're very expensive
without the Apollo guidance computer the

433
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,129
only people willing to put up with them
were people building about people

434
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:58,590
building nuclear missiles

435
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,909
because they have they're willing to to
ever attack

436
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:05,480
amped bill small missiles took part in
the summary for example

437
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,619
by everybody else really truly hated
them

438
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,310
what was unique about the

439
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,349
apart kinds computer was a decided to
make it one completely

440
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:21,119
Adam integrated circuits am the block to
this is a bubble talk

441
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,440
this ATC I have here the block to add
like something like 2800

442
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,090
am NOR gates as you all know wat you
have in your gate you can build any

443
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,849
other kind a gate by simply enough

444
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:36,590
them together is here and and you're not
gates hola geologic skates

445
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,190
so basically Nash was wearing a boat

446
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,369
of and integrated circuits in the early
days at one point nasa his response for

447
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,050
something like forty to fifty percent

448
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,678
all the IC's needed world we're going
into

449
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,369
and Apollo program going into polygons
program

450
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:57,379
what this did was had to fax +1 nasa
that we're not really

451
00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:01,149
nasa really anal about reliability
issues every time there's a fault among

452
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:02,179
these chips

453
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:06,020
nasa wants to know why stay with take
them up and it look at them and they

454
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,270
would look at failures

455
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,700
and doing that it dramatically improve
the manufacturing process

456
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,090
to as I mentioned integrated circuits
are very expensive

457
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,159
very few people want to buy them by
providing a guarantee customer

458
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,490
and for years am the policies really
underwrote

459
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,080
an awful lot out the early integrated
circuit manufacture

460
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,939
and the third point is is that began
people did not trust

461
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,030
politicians I'll all integrated circuit
computers by going to the bloody moon

462
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,440
and back

463
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,990
and began to set a value you can run
your chemical plant are your little tank

464
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,320
its fine cuz we went the moon with this
stuff and it wasn't until I really was

465
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,090
that was a significant I was this a
gift:

466
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,980
by proving you could trust digital
integrated circuits

467
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,310
on those highest-profile product ever
interview how came back

468
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,950
used and not really wants that really
was the purpose

469
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,220
up the commercial and into getting to
see the reason why we have all these

470
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,369
super cheap

471
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:08,169
and processes around our necks owes a
lot to this to this particular

472
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:13,889
device and Frank O'Brien very very
kindly brought me

473
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,520
in see this this is a

474
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,639
at prototype am apollo kind system this
is just a logic circuits

475
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:26,710
if you look closely I really track is
going to have this in the retro

476
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,990
computing section

477
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,159
really encourage you to look closely you
can see how integrated circuits are

478
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:32,879
polity and has a little bit

479
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:37,099
hand why iraq am going on and you're
very regional days

480
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:41,070
it was thought that be astronauts would
be will be able to repair

481
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,970
and the polygons be by slipping his
muscles in your see it's all very much

482
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,770
you know marge is a plugin then choose a
side of the house not can reach us with

483
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,800
a screwdriver

484
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,570
and so everything well so unfair but
everything was bus was designed so that

485
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,099
it was

486
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:58,349
it was completely sealed am unit

487
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:01,480
am so this is can you see that up on the
screen

488
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,960
bakery so I really strongly advise you
to please

489
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,379
and come down and visit Frank is that
this unit

490
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,750
he will also have what's what's called
dead disc E

491
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,510
Emily running and because you can you
can

492
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,070
tree much get know all this upset right
hander

493
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,658
running an emulation mode and it's
pretty cool am go back

494
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:29,730
it yes actually we should def of yet be
great to see in apollo iPhone

495
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,200
AGC application

496
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,010
sorry okay great let's have some
teleport

497
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,740
am so one important things about about
as well just to go back is that

498
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,010
use rope core memory so I used to know
you've of

499
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,010
sony's basically no fair i cor Kors

500
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,200
a topic long strings a copper wires and
this was programmed

501
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,230
by hand to me by hand by somebody think
he switches are very the for you

502
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,690
do I mean there is there a little old
ladies in the region

503
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,720
middle-age women in the record Patrick
who what

504
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,419
IDR if they pass to wire very thin wire
3 affair I call that was

505
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,750
one if they bypassed 0

506
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,200
solos literally these were practically
hand-woven memories

507
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,629
am each apollo mission had

508
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:23,970
it had to the program called had to be
delivered six weeks before the mission

509
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,159
is to to launch

510
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,220
you know you could not change it was no
catch

511
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,440
she could get a read your mind you know
here's an early dinner bro

512
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,139
she just stick it in there no do you and
I think a lot of the quality

513
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:40,750
of the softer was because they knew
there could be changes

514
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,790
you could in fact around you couldn't go
okays 1.0

515
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,980
the fight that said each version have
the

516
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,399
each version after the modules went with
a slightly different version

517
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,490
and impact us because admission promise
change

518
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,210
issues with hardcoded in part because it
to get better they did try

519
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,240
am eliminate some bucks am

520
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,230
but i've seen a that is good the MIT
Museum they have a distinction what's

521
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,290
called luminary

522
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,178
and it's about it's a piece a fan for a
paper which is about white

523
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,530
statistic which is a complete program
listing

524
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,530
all of which was fitted into about am

525
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,980
72 kilobytes 636

526
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,310
words three 72 kilobytes from had about
to kill a bite

527
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:29,089
am to the way it works was have this
verb noun syntax I was a little bit like

528
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,310
damn

529
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,408
the early Activision text adventure
games for you

530
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:36,720
as said you see a present for when you
type a2

531
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,300
Pacha digit code for suburban do
something now

532
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,619
would say water awesome might be firm

533
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,050
the firm I translate to load these
numbers into memory and now but specify

534
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,629
exactly

535
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:51,659
numbers where the works too damn unit
type in

536
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,740
just a on my little offices octal for
extra

537
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,690
extra fun and games am I should see also
one final thing on the disc EU CDs green

538
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,399
lights

539
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,869
lot of people think these are like LED
displays am

540
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,030
LED's weren't really around this is
built his reelection luminescent

541
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,960
displays

542
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,349
which ran it three hundred volts selves

543
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:15,399
kinda been a serious engineering into
went into for this display itself is

544
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:15,849
also

545
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:19,480
was also gramme broke bread rating so

546
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,169
back to our for Burger circling the moon
with a dodgy for fun

547
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:26,700
and Linda Marshall computer was locked
out from acting am

548
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,179
prom for now but as soon as the answer
was fired

549
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,609
dan the computer thinks he's had to pay
attention to the park but

550
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:38,129
am amateur where two programs p70 which
was a four-percent engine

551
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:41,649
p71 stage apparently sent engine the
normal

552
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:47,500
to send programs and take your cock 64
p65

553
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,940
so entered on my office the

554
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,530
to Hannah you know dashing young man who
working at MIT

555
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,869
am it received enough he says he came
out here when he credibly

556
00:32:57,869 --> 00:32:59,159
undistinguished

557
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,109
mast agree and basic Draper barge was in
place would kill him

558
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:06,399
more or less he was involved lot of
people wrote

559
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,990
earlier models after where he was really
did allow the hardcore working taking

560
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,339
very few radical taking the fear act
like I Z creations

561
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:19,230
control equations and and conferring
those at the actual code

562
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,859
that would run it a lot of the very
critical flight reading car

563
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:26,399
gots flight control system you're
turning on the engine

564
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,000
turning spacecraft crashing to the
ground and

565
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,060
so he did he's alone at work

566
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,980
now muskan

567
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,710
ok area so hola 14 the ass not sir

568
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,129
art really want to land and they were
like a solution these

569
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:49,250
an to the first idea that O'Donnell's

570
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,649
who and they're always act that the
house has a story going round the

571
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:56,720
you know he was sitting at home in the
air force close up its big limousine

572
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,320
guys its soldiers and I think somebody
MIT much in the Andromeda Strain cuz i

573
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
think thats actually

574
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,770
from but and we still await like save
the mission fact he was in his office

575
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,460
as he always walks for mission and when
the guys came in it says haiti aboard

576
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,440
discrete

577
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,369
homes and businesses like ok to and it
was obvious we click here

578
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:18,690
to his first idea was well we'll just

579
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,168
using basic equipment up a pole command
were just disable the Fort Minor manly

580
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:26,408
Angelfire up the computer will start
looking for the import

581
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,980
code well just tell them to turn off the
bar code but that would mean that the

582
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,589
asset was bracing

583
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:35,179
the computer balance older ball you know
was being accelerated

584
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:39,510
taken anywhere if the ass or not you
know what his party at our fingers

585
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,010
couldn't get more sometimes there in
space suits and so that was actually

586
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,040
if gas I could not beat that

587
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,889
that the time the the monomer check that
switch hundred times before

588
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:55,889
the ass I wouldn't like it out so would
mean a real race condition

589
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:00,070
would not be good so now as for solution
which they radioed opportunities

590
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,369
particularly happy with

591
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:05,099
alan shepard was commanders marginal
does you no min

592
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,510
no bad from the asks we know that he was
not noted for his

593
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,190
general common good temper

594
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,359
Thursday pretty pretty grumpy about this
to the second solution

595
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:21,040
and is working americans love complex
damage in for time senator

596
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,540
fifty-minute okay great so step one

597
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,509
was a puter wanted to ignition and so
the computer is a okay I'm gonna

598
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,580
ignited there's a whole count 'em
process which would happen if we turn on

599
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,000
power ups and stuff

600
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,359
and so you would turn the AGC so that we
think it's already in the middle of an

601
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,779
abort

602
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,180
to school when you have time and you
would say you

603
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,210
program is so that it would repeat it
supports this verb

604
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,960
21 now one business program to what was
called

605
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,000
again was an octopus he said 107 at the
end

606
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,200
server 21 was basically the equivalent
army

607
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,490
poke statement so this basically kinda
results to

608
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,970
those you remember basic che Mike Connor
64 roots here

609
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:10,000
am for twenty-one was basically just
this crap is equivalent of Polk

610
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,280
1010 count 107 which was part

611
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,589
107 which was the October for 71 into
memory location

612
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:22,490
1010 and so with the computer resigned
as if it's already in the middle of the

613
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,300
port

614
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,750
there's no point in starting the import
mater because you've already

615
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,050
phiri done you must have address how
would you be in a min abort

616
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,109
and celebrating if your gonna sucks and
fucks you now

617
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:39,420
so they punched in this one and then
however

618
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,400
there's a bitter public as a kinda cap
on the computer and it will be your

619
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,250
place

620
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,609
for it will continue its countdown and
then but it won't

621
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:50,240
throttle up all the way if you don't
throttle up the engine all the way

622
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,599
in the way that the Miss designers have
done you land somewhere else

623
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,980
God knows where he will do weird things
to really think you're gonna

624
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,630
and am so we needed to do was 12 26
seconds after ignition

625
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,829
on their manual control they would
parsed throttle up to mack's

626
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:11,579
miss a manual everything was still being
flown through the polygons computer was

627
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,770
no true manual

628
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,009
million marge was you understand
everything was still done done through

629
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,010
but there was

630
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,589
the computer didn't know that if the
human being as pressing a certain

631
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:22,529
control

632
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,990
and you know let the human being have
his way and take a nap

633
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,290
sorry are max Manali who said that salt
maximum

634
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,490
to another blazing through the sky with
the engine rocket firing in Maxim para

635
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,000
hazard

636
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,400
using energy in a guy eavesdrop towards
the service

637
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,200
and now you have to turn on all money
first it is difficult to the second that

638
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,230
we should talk manana

639
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,740
and many simulated they realized later
Marshall didn't do anything

640
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,119
and is kinda state its position down
which is also considered bad

641
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,750
and chinita like turning and am

642
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,349
so they now needed to turn the landing
softer so again

643
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:03,810
am they did another they did another am

644
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,109
tree hack and this time they're sending
a bit so for twenty

645
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:10,560
tree five down seven is actually and
bitwise

646
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,589
operator and again when I wanted to
Hunter

647
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:16,980
summer fish that and bet that's being
changed his one

648
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,339
to actually sending a single bit flag
inside the memory with a one there

649
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:25,509
an when they did that so now they had
control

650
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,920
and now it was time to turn off the
former

651
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,099
and so this again was another

652
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:37,609
bitwise entry yes good ones server tree
597 uses both

653
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:41,328
that wise different memory address and
now they're saying it is your

654
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:45,460
to the clearing the vents and that a
court martial never start

655
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,520
am now I can anyone do little to clean
up

656
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,530
get the proper and descent program

657
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,060
running to you hands a greater kinda
good stuff

658
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,660
and again it's in other at Polk
statement and so you see it's the

659
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,879
opposite is very similar to the region
stately for centered

660
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,369
see first year they put in for 21 and
seven memory 1010

661
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:09,440
107 and then they punched in

662
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,180
for 10 10 10 10 77 which i think were 65

663
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,270
64 63 sorry ass

664
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:21,650
for the actual and descent catcher and
then you have to drop the file back to

665
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,710
minimum so that

666
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,680
you day where the computer no longer
searching the override

667
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,100
am to eke nears their times and it
needed the computer program you go down

668
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,470
to partial thrust

669
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,050
and that was when it send him at all to
Mac

670
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,050
let their computer really do the full
range

671
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,480
talk its so countries the end here

672
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,570
further reading am for like a really
great

673
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,720
you know what it's like to be a fly
controller in Mission Control

674
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,350
sign the burgh of am Polycom he was
e.com

675
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,670
who is there when apollo thirteen fuel
cells blew up and he's just amazing guy

676
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,120
and he's got a great story needed

677
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,259
just talk back for he thought about 15
just getting up and walking away

678
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,510
and then you notice that the consoles in

679
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,560
India miss your truck had his baby
capsules

680
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,950
and their dick to you could lift them
out into servicing but the controllers

681
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,380
colin powell candles

682
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,620
cousin moments like this and live as
ages you just grab those handles

683
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,370
and you hold on you just you and then
you get it together

684
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,569
and then you go on he's got in his in
his

685
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,140
in his book he's got like printouts from
I use on his screens during the whole

686
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,759
disasters

687
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,050
it's really great to get a Polycom
donald's who's actually

688
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,420
an hour anarchist now to see its nation
art am

689
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,070
he's got a lot of detail about the
Apollo the AG Seans

690
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,600
are lots girly things that happen Apollo
11 and someone starts protect manic

691
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,490
can't recommend enough the Apollo lunar
surface journal which amtrak also

692
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,530
am contributes to am just a huge air

693
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,150
huge array of really great stuff another
again cuz I said

694
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,470
at the start I'm really interested in
engineering centric histories space

695
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,250
program

696
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,800
am apollo by Marie Anne Cox is a very
engineering

697
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,270
eccentric ok it's because out of print I
think they have their own privacy

698
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,950
printing you can still get copies here
in there

699
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,010
it's really is ask nichols' right
through from Mercury to the mercury days

700
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:18,110
am through the pop program digital
Apollo which the guy called David

701
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,310
Mundell

702
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,370
which really goes into law the tensions
between the astronauts and some in the

703
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,049
engineering and decisions and how much
control

704
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,790
to the assets has asked us hated being
spammed a cap

705
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,870
they wanted loss of control as much
control as possible

706
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,500
and frances was a at a serious

707
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,610
idea for a while that an ass not with
Manly's we have these boosters

708
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:46,470
Saturn fiery Alice Tigers the ass not
would fly descend program

709
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,850
and manage in the middle like it well
gee much

710
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:54,700
an they were just waited from this but
there is a there's a huge tension

711
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,820
in the system between what you automated
and what you did not meet

712
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,880
and Dan David Mundell really talk spec
talks but that and second have to pick

713
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,470
and the demand book am cab chapter in
this book

714
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,130
which stocks bad learn more about apollo
thirteen risk for Prince the dust which

715
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,860
just came out

716
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,880
we just comes a whole bunch of the other
missions and just talk by the ass cuz

717
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,050
they were awesome in

718
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,440
I think apollo thirteen show there
really was a long wisdom having

719
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,720
test pilots because those are guys who
could after

720
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,300
days of no sleep entering command
sequences

721
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:31,430
fiercely here's so I think that is about
it so I would love to take

722
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:38,430
depression

723
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,570
it counters were here okay

724
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,620
ass when you have any questions I think
there i think is

725
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,830
microphone yeah thank you do you know if
a

726
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,210
Dymo label take making gun was part of
the

727
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:58,490
on board flight equipment I do not know
daschle expression very sorry

728
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,700
I know Seattle been a mix-up in the
beginning iOS 4's

729
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,140
what was it SC he was a leader in SC two
cocks work the astronauts

730
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,069
like Muslims ex-military people want a
dislike you will see your ako

731
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,050
you know lesser-known clutch well
someone and they also came from

732
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,440
different cultures I mean

733
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,740
am yet more summer military pilots why
did induce Erica

734
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,770
because a lot of wasn't but the two had
they had developed their own jargon an

735
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,790
and so they they tended not to use all
the phonetic stuff you see there are

736
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,650
some other so

737
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,650
for instance the an the the idle state
apollo

738
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,990
kites computer was program 00 surround
saying

739
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,910
Peter 00 they set up computers into and
so the

740
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,000
to the jargon is just was just they
develop their own jargon as you say made

741
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,850
a left then that this contract

742
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,970
a ser your your talk highlights the
value being able to construct an

743
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,040
expedient solution to an unexpected
problem using tools at hand and be

744
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,500
having

745
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,150
somewhat discrete components do you
think the systems they would put in

746
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,410
aerospace and space mission hardware
today would allow for that kinda thing

747
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,529
is easily or

748
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,330
I mean do you think that they're
thinking at that ahead a time that we

749
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,259
might need to do things that we didn't
know you need

750
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,700
I think I think no because because this
was a tense with the with the AGC

751
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,790
that it was basically a back box and
this was the complaint that made you

752
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,950
couldn't do anything with it

753
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,540
at the turn out to be the softer sex
porn after the realtor

754
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,320
to get around it so am I'm not shy

755
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,980
I think that yes you see stuff being
guns together the maybe you might like

756
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,640
to have

757
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,100
am the previous generation my treated
but

758
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,570
will open up other opportunities that
for different types of solutions

759
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,140
so I don't think we'll and the clues
future sorry I was wondering if the

760
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,540
only channel for communicating
especially all the commands

761
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,890
activist but his voice or if they also
had a redundant data channel now they

762
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,879
could enter the data channel and David
Mundell points at

763
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,520
Dimondale I think talks Donna to guy
called an

764
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,290
alcohol and he was the real genius
behind

765
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,610
the design of the AGC and

766
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,930
hall says this is proof that the assets
never really trusted the computer

767
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,859
because he could have sent up those
commands

768
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,530
on the ditch but because the ass has had
read it at a rendering it manually

769
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,690
it may be asked the EPA found with a
repeat of the situation and you know

770
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,970
key kinda want people who are you know
her finger on the moon to feel

771
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,160
psychologically comfortable

772
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,160
so okay I

773
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,190

774
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:29,730

779
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,839
asking country was close at this mission

780
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,230

781
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,650

805
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,350
trained

806
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,950

on this very long transitory

810
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,990
but they play that loop over and over
again later on a gene krantz with tags

817
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,540
have to come up with ownership while
they're floating around noon we think it

818
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,150
was bad who spent 90 minutes

819
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,040
okay thank you cash and second how did
they determine or did they determined

820
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,009
during the event

821
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,240
but it was a soccer ball I'll take the
suspected it was a star on come on the

822
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,820

826
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:12,299
