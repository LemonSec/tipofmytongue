1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,170
power shut it down begins

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,300
okay

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,300
ready in a minute okay

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,990
okay my name's John McNab giving a talk
on electronic

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,040
kickback which I'll explain Nike Pro in
the Boston area

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,700
I do tech support for major bank that I
probably should name

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,850
know that I'm here I worked on this
issue

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,059
for Clean Water Action in Massachusetts
from 1999 to 2009

9
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,690
and worked on the issue try to pass
legislation on the subject

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,290
Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut
help the National issues

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,449
rhodesia report for Clean Water Action
that's been cited across the world

12
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:59,780
because back in 2001 there were really
worth that much

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,589
written on the subject is a lot more now
a founding member of the National

14
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:04,589
Electronic stickback

15
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,610
campaign in the early nineties EPA try
to get a national dialogue

16
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,850
wish to get industry governments and

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,840
organizations like the water action to
agree on a national strategy for

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,170
have two companies pay for the
collection and recycling

19
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,260
use electronics and that that fell
through so the snows

20
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,660
national plan get to that I've had a
role in so sure

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,020
recycling cooperative forming it so in
solid waste

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,729
which is this this issue is related to
with Ms Martin burma protection

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,790
he def gonna totally different subject
on cyber terrorism and the drinking

24
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,930
water infrastructure

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,420
soul I don't think I'm an expert on
electronics

26
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,090
or the technical aspects recycling
reprocessing

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,080
but I have work for ten years on the
policy regulatory implications

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,570
love disposing of talk about electronic
waste

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,630
so on have a lot of experience and

30
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,300
death by PowerPoint so I'm gonna
complicated PowerPoint presentation I

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,500
will try to read everything on every
slide

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,060
jumping-off point so this is a a brief
outline

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,950
definitions of the fine problem what you
PR is

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,700
I give examples house when approached in
European Union

35
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,290
US the businesses some

36
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,329
short stories on on track record how to
discard

37
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,530
your electronics and definitions read
through all these

38
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,010
you waste no universal

39
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,518
approve definition the waist most people
talk about

40
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,129
every organization our country's the
different way Europe

41
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,620
the use the term WEEE we

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,739
and they actually the best definition
from a public policy standpoint from a

43
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,799
recycler for environmentalist in it with
everything

44
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,680
basically is like a long like page
definition but really need anything with

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,189
the plug

46
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:04,099
cited electronic but its electrical so
it's vacuum cleaners toasters

47
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:09,069
wonders but but here we're most
concerned with electronic components &

48
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,180
in computers but it

49
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,629
goes also covers monitors laptops cetera

50
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:17,310
and I won't read the rest of this but
you can see

51
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,739
our talk to sing computers the long list

52
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,090
were familiar with mercury and lead all

53
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,700
the toxic issue the got this going a lot
of states with lead

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,120
in cathode ray tubes those before LCD

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,379
became predominant because it's forty
pounds

56
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,950
lead in a key or computer monitor

57
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,010
that's an LCD that's a CRT and a lot of
that waste

58
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,230
showing up in landfill leachate so those
polypill

59
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,889
PVC mercury this PCB

60
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,959
is a very long list um up toxic and just

61
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,469
constituents such that computers should
be classified as hazardous waste

62
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,249
and in many cases they haven't been in
the thrown away regular landfills

63
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:05,870
which is the next subject that even
after

64
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,919
the increase in recycling regulations
and X extended producer responsibility

65
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,459
regulations and laws

66
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,739
to require more recycling these still

67
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,298
more more service goes into landfills
and incinerators on

68
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:23,460
the numbers from these numbers are five
years old because it's hard to get more

69
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,340
recent numbers

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,660
but her 33,000 PCs discarded each year
as a 2005 might be more now

71
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,830
to six point million tons of e-waste but
only thirty .6 percent recycled

72
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,550
again that was 2005 was probably a lot
better on

73
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,100
but as I mentioned earlier forty percent
of heavy metals in landfills and this is

74
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,200
little each ate the contaminated water

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,479
landfill you know lead mercury can

76
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,780
cadmium identified as coming from from
electronic discards

77
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,020
and environmental reason to reduce the
amount

78
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,599
up toxics electronic company

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,050
components in computers but also to
reduce how much are actually

80
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,500
landfill were incinerated

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,590
the course the winning recycling
increased we found that a lot of it was

82
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,460
going to third world countries

83
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,479
where it's called informal recycling

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,570
meeting date: got a pilot the set up in
a village in Wang Xiao China

85
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,790
and people are pulling apart in the open

86
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,330
and taking out the copper wire up
pulling out parts to

87
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,210
meltdown metal on in open furnaces

88
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,450
in the country and is this a long the
group in

89
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,900
that's the end. acronym are the United
States I think it's their website

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,840
as well as well-documented on the
environmental damage in the health

91
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,240
damage caused to these

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,410
residents who are trying to make money
from the usable components

93
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,660
in electronic waste Anders

94
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,820
there's millions $20 to $50 million
tonnes

95
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,840
are generated worldwide estimate the
fifty-eight percent

96
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,030
the waist recycled in the US goes to
China

97
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,180
Ghana some third world country and and
that's a major

98
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,760
issue all by itself not concentrating on
that issue that's one

99
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,140
reason why we want to have better
control love

100
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,330
discarded electronic waste

101
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,690
on my problem with electronic waste not
designed for the most part for recycling

102
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,080
some vendors are getting better now but
I know from

103
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,609
fixing them that many them their non
standard parts

104
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,690
you know every every even this same
model Dell or HP will have a different

105
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,060
way

106
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,550
opening the case to be different screws
the beach cruiser non-standard screws to

107
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,030
be X

108
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,210
screws that you you know you have
trouble finding the export for

109
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,590
this annex a plastics which means it's
in many cases the Pasig

110
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,700
recyclable because if it's a mix the net
just

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,950
just can't go to the recycling plant

112
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,159
I know that it's hard learn how to
disassemble laptop sometimes because

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,640
they

114
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,870
sometimes keep control over the over the
manuals arm

115
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,080
but it's a it's a well-documented
problem that electronics computers

116
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,409
laptops

117
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,090
are very are not designed for recycling
on

118
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,660
there's in many cases there are some
modular parts but in many cases

119
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,800
its its its me hard its

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,180
made it's made for purpose not that they
didn't include recycling in mind

121
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,590
so it's hard to disassemble in an easy
way in a

122
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,940
regular way if you try to recycled parts

123
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,719
however there are valuable on materials
in them is an estimated

124
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,540
metric ton computers has more golden 17
got tons of coal or

125
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,100
so if you can be mining gold you know
get a couple times

126
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,380
use computers if you have the you can in
that might be cheaper to get gold

127
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,040
and actually mining it this crap shows a
generation

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,700
um electronic waste as compared to the
recovery

129
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,960
which is a general term for recycling or
reuse whatever wait the 2006

130
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,990
I believe just for the US so we still
with

131
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,140
it's been going on haven't caught up
with the generation

132
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,219
increasing obsolescence again not saying
we shouldn't improve products

133
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,710
and well wall firmly with with Moore's
Law on

134
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,400
that the computing power doubles every
18 months and the cost decreases

135
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,740
I think by fifty percent the same same
period

136
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,190
on but because at that and other drivers
for

137
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,960
improvements on is a decreasing life
span to computers

138
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
words estimated now two to three years
for

139
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,389
for computers some people keep them up
to four years but

140
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,349
I know for fixing them when they get to
four years there there are bad shape

141
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,899
so there's a is a quick a large turnover

142
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,979
so one way to deal with the large
turnover as you try to reuse them

143
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,320
what you can but I think the room know
that

144
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,360
you know there's not much use for 46
these days the

145
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,649
maybe a few years ago user somethings or
pension 12 with three

146
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,700
on so there is a potential for reuse a
lot of people do that they'll

147
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,350
refurbish give and give it to a
nonprofit but again those are only good

148
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,170
for certain amount of time because the
as you know the software

149
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,469
upgrades require stronger processors and
more memory

150
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,490
but that's one way to keep keep them in
some useful

151
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,440
mold or keeping a model landfills or
incinerators

152
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,840
more than 150 thousand computers and
televisions become obsolete and use

153
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,560
every day

154
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,990
again a 45 year old statistic on

155
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,090
so it's probably more than that

156
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,130
now this is the the major issue

157
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,860
that I've been dealing with I was
working for Clean Water Action in trying

158
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,510
to

159
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,300
get ER which I mean it explain the next
slide

160
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,860
adopted is that back in the early
nineteen hundred's most waste

161
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,640
was not manufactured products in fact
that were manufactured products

162
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,250
there people most waste was ashes from
burning

163
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,450
in their household through the ashes out
be food scraps

164
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,160
throw out so what happened was the first

165
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,969
municipal always programs were in
philadelphia new york

166
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,440
and Ben Franklin's are the first one
Delphia

167
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,690
where they tried to clean up the scraps
before the fleiss

168
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,279
the fly breeding schedule cause more
flies to be in them that actually was

169
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,320
one the Genesis is

170
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,950
up local governments taking overpaying
for solid waste collection recycling

171
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,020
since a course 1900

172
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,090
top graph shows major increase in
manufactured goods

173
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,500
that's been happening the local
municipalities to cities and towns the

174
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,560
county's

175
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,720
happen still picking up the tab for
collection and disposal

176
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,010
and in some cases recycling has been
increasing up

177
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,000
%uh solid waste so what this does
economically

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,300
is that the externality the cost

179
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,690
for the collection and disposal
recycling is born by

180
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,029
the local municipality by the taxpayers

181
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,870
it's not borne by the people who make
the material to the general issue

182
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,570
not limited to om the waist

183
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,900
up that that's been been going on the
nation you know worldwide since the

184
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,350
early nineteen hundred's

185
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,290
arm so if the low if you make make a
product

186
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,459
and you don't pay the cost for trying to
recycle it

187
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,570
you know economic incentive for making
recyclable

188
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,720
if you don't pay the cost for disposing
of what can be recycled

189
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,620
and and in some cases that it's
hazardous waste cost more

190
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,670
to properly dispose you have no
incentive to

191
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,719
reduce the cost and lower the mark talks
it's being used

192
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,700
you might have other reasons you might
have drivers like cover elation and

193
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,120
that's what's happening in Europe in

194
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,200
many other countries and slowly in the
US but you neva economic reason

195
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,330
and in a free market economy that's the
best driver

196
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,800
most people find for product
improvements is that they

197
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,930
if the cost is passed on not passed on
to the

198
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,330
to the municipality but it's kept by the
manufacturer

199
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:58,260
suddenly they're gonna lack of consent
to do the right thing

200
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,600
and that's what thinking of that problem
and in the problem

201
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,089
the increase from um

202
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,230
manufactured goods being picked up by
municipalities

203
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,620
led to the conserve extended producer
responsibility

204
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,960
which was developed in Sweden starting
the 1970s in them by the founder

205
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,430
a Thomas link West I came pronounce his
name

206
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,510
on from Sweden who coined the term

207
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,540
extended producer responsibility arm
which means that the responsibility of

208
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,329
the producer for product

209
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,880
doesn't and when it's all to the
consumer

210
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,210
that's the usual case this is a warranty
or something special for that product

211
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,370
arm you know which which is in every
case

212
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,730
accepts responsibility means that the
responsibility the producer

213
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,560
for the manufacture extends to the
entire life cycle the product

214
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,870
in and by deep your application that

215
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,589
means that the cost for collection of
the product

216
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,940
recycling hopefully arm and the
environmentally safe disposal

217
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,779
campy recycled is picked up by
manufacturer

218
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,189
and and applies to all manufacturers and
that's the best systems that work

219
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,210
is that applies to all the manufacturers
are the same product

220
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,770
om thats that's the that pure form which
we

221
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,500
don't really see anywhere in the world
arm should lead

222
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,820
to product improvements okay the goal to
be

223
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
yard input on the slide number one
should be product improvements to deal

224
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,450
with the problems have been talking
about

225
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,670
it's not just about recycling people
talk a product stewardship

226
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,990
repr product responsibility and lot
about the terms that

227
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,520
have talk about something different but
I try to talk with the PR

228
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,990
om it's not just for recycling it's
really

229
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,760
looking taking the cost of the Miss
appellees it's not there

230
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,189
responsibility if you fall theory it's
the manufacturer

231
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,260
arm by putting a custom manufacturer
they will then make the product improve

232
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,480
the product design

233
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,670
make it less toxic or recyclable and
then insert a product

234
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,459
every for an inverse product collection
chain to pick it up

235
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:09,830
so you see here I the charts a bomb the

236
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,020
the second one here my screen

237
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,319
helping you very much I know middle

238
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,480
graphic shows the arm the current

239
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,180
you know usual process Supplier producer
retailer

240
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,230
consumer governments involved sometimes
you go through disposer

241
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,430
and then sometimes stuff gets back to
the supplier on

242
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,180
but it but in a in the bottom graphic

243
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,620
a.m. you would have just have to be
called because responsibility

244
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,089
organization but to be a group

245
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,360
in in the chain that would interrupt
that would be involved

246
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,730
to work for the producer to

247
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,580
handle the wrist the collection
recycling and that sucks how it works in

248
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,540
some programs in europe

249
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,550
and what Thomas linguist wrote a paper
on its own is a graduate student

250
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,149
in Sweden he referred to the success

251
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:05,100
the bottle bill which is one of the
first applications for this in the US

252
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,680
and some other parts of the world

253
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,180
where we looked at the recovery love

254
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,459
loom can spit balls in glass bottles and
the total

255
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,620
in the bottle bill states the few states
that help all bills

256
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,770
11 state at that time wife 2006

257
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,550
and then non-political state city found
was more than almost triple

258
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,380
the recovery and as you know bottle bill
is a typer produce responsibility with

259
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,630
the

260
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,010
with the with the producer the soft
drink the drink

261
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,980
arm is required to arm impose a5 center
to center

262
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,870
ten-cent fee on the can or or the
container

263
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,740
as an incentive to return the can and
then that's worth the risk required to

264
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,880
arm you know recovery sry Reese

265
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,019
recycler hopefully and so that thats

266
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,380
the most common example most people are
aware of

267
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,410
now arm when I started working at the
1999 there was no chart

268
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,140
love countries the purity US laws the
only thing we had were bottle bills in

269
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,779
many cases and people talking about it
but now

270
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,709
was actually a little update I couldn't
find the more recent we've got twenty

271
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,800
more than twenty states in the US

272
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,100
arm and four provinces in Canada we've
got some South American countries

273
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,540
the biggest up practitioner VBR is

274
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,689
the European Union arm and then there's
a lot of movement

275
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,300
going on in the Far East the Near East
Taiwan China South Korea Japan and the

276
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,029
Philippines

277
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:35,170
the Genesis for

278
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,450
PR regulation in the world

279
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,310
0 again the after bottle bills the next
example the first application to this

280
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,550
was the green dot program in Germany

281
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,360
which applied to packaging on and and
they

282
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,649
did this in Germany in the early
nineteen hundred's because packaging was

283
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,750
taking over

284
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,019
their soul waste disposal our capacity
thirty to forty percent or more

285
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,070
other stuff being disposed of was
packaging paper

286
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,760
cardboard plastic you name it so they
had to get a handle on it so they said

287
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,408
how will require the manufacturers to
pay for this

288
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:12,100
and so either the so the party the
manufacturers to set up their own

289
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,339
collection program or be charged a fee

290
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,049
and they try to figure the fee be high
enough so that would be

291
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:23,010
so the so the companies would one have
to pay it they they paid themselves

292
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,949
and hopefully the morning Morgan
themselves with lower their cost

293
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:30,150
so all the the the packaging
manufacturers are the people selling

294
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,059
packaging

295
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,960
inge in Germany are formed a third-party
organization

296
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,130
ob nonprofit the green dot program

297
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,670
that set up collection vehicles that was
separate from the municipal

298
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,970
the the cunt or the National collection
program

299
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,240
and you know that a product went to that
if it had agreed on it

300
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,490
so that became the slogan in the in the
in the in the

301
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,020
your the the local for dealing with it

302
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,520
so are after from 1991 to 1995

303
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,100
are it dramatically reduced the
packaging in Germany at the same time it

304
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,950
increased

305
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,750
more you know more than that in the US I
in the recovery goals

306
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,920
still exceeded today it recovers
discarded packaging reduce the packaging

307
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,100
use because

308
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,570
while they want to reduce their feet
because they're paying for

309
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,840
so how do you reduce your feed to reduce
the weight you say to do I really need a

310
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,379
box is big media and one smaller or with

311
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,380
certified materials I can use one

312
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,700
so this is some recent materials my
first learned about

313
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,890
nineteen ninety thousand it still had a
had

314
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,679
you know good record but the the most
recent records show

315
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,230
that its exceeded its goals by quite a
bit

316
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,620
know the European Union has led the way
arm

317
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,070
in so every European as the 2004 there
was a European Union law passed the

318
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,750
the we directive we directive

319
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,700
arm in I'm paraphrasing here requires
produces everything with the plug

320
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,730
these pages and pages but the
definitions but everything with the plug

321
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,500
arm required each technically cars each
member country

322
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,690
by a certain date which is two thousand
August 2004

323
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,140
and some had 2005 to sell this local
laws

324
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,240
and they some flexibility in how they
set it up to require

325
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,809
all the manufactures that sold in that
country

326
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,720
that's all the product that met the
requirements under the law in the

327
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,510
country

328
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,450
to set up a program so the manufactures
would be financially responsible for the

329
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,170
collection

330
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,059
and recycling the product I should
clarify we talk about producer take back

331
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,559
army doesn't mean that in every case the
pre you know HP

332
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,660
house to pick up your use laptop or you
have to take

333
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,390
HP facility doesn't really matter where
it goes long as what does not work goes

334
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,520
but

335
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,290
we want them infectious pay for kids
were talking financial responsibility

336
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,170
like when economic incentives so there's
a wide variety

337
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,010
in the European Union how this is done
are Germany

338
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,110
has very restrictive requirements on
that you know in in reporting

339
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,049
that have to be done and I firmly with
all the the program requirements

340
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,420
throughout all the country's

341
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,230
up it is a wide variety which is the way
we want it is no one-size-fits-all

342
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,640
for making this work the genius up a
good

343
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,210
your program is that the government

344
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,870
has a law says you're responsible
producer for paying for the collection

345
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,190
recycling this product you set it up
yourself

346
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,410
or the other manufactured similar
products whatever whatever's

347
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,660
whatever's you know your preference and
Europe

348
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,350
they they gave the European Union gave
all produces

349
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,290
electronic components that choice you
want to do it like in Green Dot 31

350
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,250
third-party organization or you wanna do
individually and surprised they want to

351
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,090
do individually

352
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,428
and the reason I found a in lobbying on
the Massachusetts with HP

353
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,799
another other quote companies they want
control

354
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,780
surprise up their recovered products
some animal worried about to reduce

355
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,990
market that under their control

356
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,650
sort of too many which is happening now
anyway on

357
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,970
so so they want to build it know where
it's going even if they don't get

358
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,630
themselves

359
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,650
rather than going it's a big pot and
suddenly use HP or Dell components are

360
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,120
being sold all over the place

361
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,850
that's my theory but

362
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,850
if you're supportive appr in a better
way to manage

363
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,220
use electronic waste we are really care
as long as they're picking up the tab

364
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,030
and their meeting the goals

365
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,620
the other major legislation in Europe
was Rohl

366
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,750
with you you know about the US because
you see a lot of products with the

367
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,330
re: that's a RHS compliant

368
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,639
so even though our HS which prohibits
the use of 1000

369
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,730
I see hundreds sexy thousands it's
almost everything you know it

370
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,100
it's ramping up its ok I'll like with
like 1200 substances and says by certain

371
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,210
dates you cannot

372
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,330
make a product with the substance or you
have to prove to the European Council

373
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,139
whatever your environmental agency why
you can't and you have to get a safer

374
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,980
alternative

375
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,730
now in many cases you can like lead free
solder is a major move in across the

376
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,520
world for lead-free solder

377
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,830
which is good the maybe this probably
many applications we can't do that

378
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,860
so that's taken into account

379
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,320
so that so that applies worldwide
because anybody selling to the European

380
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,480
markets owing to the US and probably
Japan

381
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,910
enormous liberals so that's been a big
driver for love the

382
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,640
the the promise that me here

383
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,370
order to cover these other points

384
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,890
so the European Union's what led the way
for for what we're trying to get done in

385
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,010
the US

386
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,780
you know the US again when I started
1999 I wrote a bill in Massachusetts

387
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,080
I was working for Clean Water Action a
very general bill

388
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,000
saying basie the concept that all
companies who sell

389
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,830
Computer Products Inc in Massachusetts
have to set up a program approved by the

390
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,290
State

391
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,080
to collect and recycle used waste and
since send the bill hasn't passed but

392
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,740
got much more complicated

393
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,840
are because we've seen what's happening
in Europe and

394
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,370
since then companies have actually
gotten on the bandwagon after a lot of

395
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,660
political pressure from Clean Water
Action

396
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,610
national electronics take-back campaign
Greenpeace other groups

397
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,799
on and Dell NHP and even Apple

398
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,950
came in later om are

399
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,690
almost every manufacture now has some
sort of reproach free program

400
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,620
and they support some extent in general
anyway

401
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,530
state laws arm requiring them due to pay
for the recycling collection recycling

402
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:36,530
so now we have one 123 456 789 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

403
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,668
twenty states in California california
is in a different color

404
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:45,860
because it's not a DPR law when you get
to that in a minute

405
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,370
arm in massachusetts still hasn't passed
the bill yet

406
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:54,260
that's a whole other story very strong
lobbying by somebody

407
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,210
because all the industries in our favor
of it so no one supposing it was the

408
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,360
game the damn thing pass for some reason

409
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,740
so it's it's been at the bill a bill
this standard bill now

410
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,919
are that's being proposed in all the
states want the arguments for

411
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,130
against having states do it not have a
national program

412
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,660
that we hear we heard when what we
wanted to stay tell you gonna get a

413
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,600
patchwork

414
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,059
different state regulations which we r
on

415
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:26,230
but the environmental groups and the
state environmental agencies

416
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,260
in the EPA and the company's evolved AC
green

417
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,780
try to make a similar as possible so the
couple model bills

418
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,289
dell has a model bill HP is a model bill

419
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:40,980
on that then we doing the Regional
Council of Governments as a model bill

420
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,400
and they're all pretty good but they're
all different very key issues

421
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,039
that would take a whole nother talk to
go over on but the good news is there's

422
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,700
movement

423
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,320
in many other states and so we're least
during the last

424
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,030
republican administrations we stayed
away from try to get something on

425
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,970
federally

426
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,140
I'm still not too sure if we want to do
anything federally arm

427
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,200
butted it would be good if you have a
federal law

428
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,179
that said at least a minimum standard so
would be the same everywhere

429
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,860
because you don't want companies picking
and choosing you know where they can

430
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,960
have locations for recycling or other
things up depending upon the different

431
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,799
state laws

432
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,850
but at least we're getting work in
progress

433
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:27,460
okay California was the first one to
pass a you waste collection law

434
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,010
and it's not any PR law it's a recycling
law

435
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,990
and part of the reason that passes
people think E produce responsibilities

436
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,710
recycling hey the problem with

437
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,250
electronic waste as we want to recycle
more it isn't it well thats

438
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,720
want the problems the main problem is
that we want the manufacturers to be

439
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,250
financially responsible

440
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,880
so that they'll approve the product and
and the municipalities around

441
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,890
you know don't have to pay for it
anymore but they gotta

442
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,010
California and they still within our in
advance recycling fee

443
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,549
six to ten dollars that's the usual
range

444
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:04,850
it's for for rum computers and see your
keys you know monitors

445
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,919
and TVs and the larger up fee comes with
the larger TVs

446
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,390
arm and I believe not use include
laptops as well but I'm not sure when I

447
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,510
write these laws are sent

448
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,760
this all these games are going on on
very specifically excluding certain

449
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,919
things

450
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,559
arm included a phase out hazardous
materials based on

451
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:26,590
you which is good so wanna make

452
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,140
have an effort to the US to phase out
the use of a toxic materials which is a

453
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,650
former

454
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,870
producer responsibility that's
government-mandated you can just

455
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,740
the best thing to do is look what's
happening in Europe and follow it

456
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,440
because it's very good

457
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,440
on but the california system is not any
PR system because

458
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,100
what the the manufactures not involved
at all really

459
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,470
on so the consumer when you buy a
product

460
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,230
pays a fee the fee goes to

461
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,850
the state California and pays for a
bureaucracy

462
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,440
do you know hire people me all you know
run offices

463
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,480
manage local recycling programs review
proposals for the local recycling

464
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,390
programs

465
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,330
and do and deregulation as well as
running the program

466
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,820
that money could in my view would be
better spent

467
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,439
reducing that the price of the product
by having the manufacture

468
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,510
put put up pull up the cost is an extra
cost during have the government

469
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,629
run a program that doesn't need to run
so I say that

470
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,299
how to do it and I've some statistics
coming up

471
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:30,710
no main now the first pure law in 2004

472
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,070
arm did not quite the pure model that I
would like but it

473
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,309
its main I mean every state is different
and so on Main they had an issue

474
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:42,590
farm and I like many would College in
Maine

475
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,590
it up desert this large rural areas were

476
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,700
you know I work in skowhegan for a while
and if you

477
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,820
%ah and grew up in Massachusetts

478
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,870
so they say some things right down the
road in a sec forty miles away that's

479
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,100
or twenty miles is right next door you
know not

480
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,900
so anyway so so the distances to deal
with a stop in alaska might be the same

481
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,230
Keiser or

482
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,470
Midwestern state as a lot of empty space
so they had a shared responsibility

483
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,650
model the council pay some of the cost

484
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,880
for just having a collection point and
then the company's

485
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,650
pay the larger cost for having trucks to
pick them up there and bring to a

486
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,740
collection center

487
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,500
where they do all the processing in the
calculate the numbers and so on

488
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,860
arm so it's reasonable

489
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,120
now did the one of the few studies that
have come out

490
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,190
are looking at effectiveness Vpr for
electronic waste

491
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,440
showed arm compared the two programs

492
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,840
and are albert had a California like
program

493
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,909
on and so the the first graph here is
the processing cost

494
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,909
which you can see is much higher in a
bird in california than a dozen

495
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:50,710
in Maine and Maryland marlon is a quite
apples to apples

496
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,340
small it up Lett smaller amount of
products

497
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,120
arm but talking about me we can see that
means

498
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,490
which is pure PPR had lower processing
costs

499
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,500
I try to be polite as much as possible

500
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,640
and the system management costs i mean
the bureaucracy to run it

501
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,169
so even in Maine you know the company's
run the program

502
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,220
but the municipalities for the state
government source to regulate thats

503
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,159
the proper role in my mind up with the
state government you should run the

504
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:18,950
program

505
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,590
it should regulated to make sure it
meets the goals so again california was

506
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,020
costs were higher than main and I don't
know what Alberta

507
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,940
I mean it's that's bizarre arm

508
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,960
so so we see and then we see the
adjusted non-scientific

509
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,309
per capita results and that's very hard
to read

510
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,678
I think I think california selected a
different study

511
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,890
structure the two studies I found that
shows us more equal

512
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,960
so there some argument but um what I'm
here for the people in Maine is that

513
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,419
this being it's been very effective arm

514
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,450
businesses are have got on the bandwagon
since I started to 99

515
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,480
reform the National Computer Tech Deck
campaign

516
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,700
and Greenpeace got involved in it in all
the environment groups got involved in

517
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,480
it

518
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,820
and the state government's got involved
in it and we tried to the DEP see the

519
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,299
national electronic product stewardship
initiative

520
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:15,030
to get a national dialogue together arm

521
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,820
didn't succeed but since then virtually
every manufacturer

522
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,020
has set up some sort of program know why

523
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,639
while it's good corporate you know if
it's not green washing and I wouldn't

524
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,299
say denny's arian washing whether

525
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,418
saying they're doing it very little
things but they really aren't it's great

526
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,539
PR

527
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:36,049
because everyone these day sees the
value of recycling and reducing waste

528
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:39,850
arm but in many cases I've talked to the
police P&L

529
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,240
they they wanted they want to do the
right thing that if it meets our

530
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,940
business model

531
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,169
you know so so in many cases it was
through

532
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,169
a political pressure del resisted for
years until

533
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:55,909
local Texas om Michael Dell lindell's
base in Texas

534
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:59,260
totally sent thousands of postcards to
Michael what house

535
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,440
with this picture on it saying Michael
why won't you help

536
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,220
the dude you know pic you know recovers
computer

537
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,200
based on that at the time and so some he
turned around and on

538
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,990
and is now has a free program and their
supporting their they want a bill

539
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,530
and their not oppose anymore to local
laws

540
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,178
requiring manufacturer take back

541
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:24,919
same thing happened Apple which
surprises that they weren't on their

542
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:25,940
first

543
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,850
on but that lot of pressure on Steve
Jobs

544
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,120
individually that's all political
pressure works 21

545
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,299
to do something so this this comes from
a I'm not an expert world programs are

546
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:42,250
but some have completely free take back
program for their own products

547
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,090
I get a look at the fine print but lot
of times you see an ad in the paper for

548
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,669
a

549
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:50,950
a pickup day and I'll give you the
parameters and go to staples or go to

550
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,380
this collection center

551
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,870
recycling center and you can drop off
your products and

552
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,630
the best ones are course the ones that
are free not because they're free to you

553
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:04,090
but because that's ok thats if the
Church 510 dolls that's not an incentive

554
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,380
for you too you know go there and and
get real and

555
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,570
and properly dispose the product arm

556
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,970
and some require consumers must pay and
some

557
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,110
I guess don't Acer in in CC on

558
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,200
so that still

559
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,710
yet she wasn't completely free but

560
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,090
but take everything I say with a grain
of salt because

561
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,750
yep you know this is what's been
advertised what I've been reading in the

562
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,039
literature on it but and I think I got
this from the computer take back

563
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,779
campaign website so if they said
anything wrong in the take that website

564
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,020
and someone called him on it

565
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,480
gonna get in trouble so on so the good
news is there are programs out there

566
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,870
sponsored by the manufacturers now the
question comes up

567
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,120
wealth immune factors are doing these
for free are setting up these programs

568
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,820
why do we need state laws

569
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,850
to require you know them to take them
back well the answer is because the free

570
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,669
if the volunteer they could stop at any
time the other answer is a must

571
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:03,820
and and love the company's agree with
this all companies have to meet the same

572
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
requirements

573
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,510
then this then you get it economic
disparities over one

574
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,830
doing a better job wife do a better job
collecting and recycling my discarded

575
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,779
products when

576
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,080
it's gonna cost me XYZ when the my
competitor isn't doing the same thing

577
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,570
and they say they are so we when we have
two

578
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:26,418
have I'll lobbying discussions and
arguments with these companies over

579
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:27,360
cable

580
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,559
and they're being honest which happens
sometimes arm

581
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,889
that's what they'll tell you and all
agreed that no walls have a program

582
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,929
you know build but we want to see
regulation is what I've heard from these

583
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:38,380
people

584
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,840
because then we know everybody has to do
the same thing and the other thing that

585
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,400
you want to avoid his work all free
riders

586
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,600
soul you get the two yet the two Big
East Dillon HP

587
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,830
so what are they they pay for program
that's not required

588
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,620
but Lenovo and Toshiba some other
companies um

589
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,200
the stock has dropped off there and so
they're getting a benefit a program that

590
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,490
the other companies are paying for

591
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:05,440
so as a for-profit company that's not a
good idea

592
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,510
arm no one of the reasons for CPR is to

593
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,349
encourage or require up on courage
actually

594
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:16,879
a greener PCs better environmentally um

595
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,049
safety sees and the limited that
obviously

596
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:24,069
because you get semiconductors you've
got you

597
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:27,308
probably you've got soldering of some
sort you've got dumb

598
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:30,929
various chemicals involved a process
that I might that

599
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:34,560
from there with and so certain
engineering requirements

600
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,679
but within those limits there are better
things you can do

601
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,659
arm like not use PVC which is very
dangerous Pittsburgh

602
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,740
incinerator releases has his way his

603
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,330
a materials the FR a brominated fire
retardant

604
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,139
I was gonna get that right which is used
as a fight you know fire

605
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,460
insulation in like see your keys
monitors TVs

606
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,200
and that causes fumes

607
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,390
so so those are toxic materials that can
be phased out

608
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,810
in most cases or all cases and are
required I believe in Europe

609
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,520
reuse recycle plastic in the plastic
makes is very important

610
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,580
cuz some plastic cover recyclable but
some

611
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,779
if you mix it with another plastic in it
you can't do anything with it you're

612
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,220
done

613
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,510
energy efficiency everyone seems to be
on that bandwagon

614
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,050
so we want them to be energy efficient
these are all from

615
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,900
Greenpeace's Guide to Greener
Electronics which I won't go to the

616
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,780
whole thing on

617
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,770
but its there's some as a scientific
basis is a rating scale

618
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,780
we were you can look and you can see for
any manufacturer agree pieces page where

619
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:47,339
they relate you can see that Nokia's up
a pin number one

620
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:51,380
I keep putting ice cream and Sony's
number two and then there's a big gap to

621
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,320
get the Philips more role

622
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,290
Apple in the middle Lenovo intend to
wait the end

623
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,920
arm so they're bad and they need to get
better so

624
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,260
18 Environment Group does this there you
know the trying to encourage through

625
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,599
public city

626
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,450
but also information working with the
company sold the company says no that

627
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,330
status makes sense I can't replace

628
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,670
XY you look at it and you go okay well

629
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,500
looking to replace it with and there's a
lot going on about with with

630
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,849
people more technical than with than me
to try to figure out what are the safer

631
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,630
alternatives and if there is one

632
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,270
that's what the company should go to and
get a driver this

633
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,420
is again if the company's have to pay
for universally which they don't

634
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,950
it's it's it's a patchwork right now in
the world in the US

635
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,730
then will be seeing more of them
voluntarily doing doing the right thing

636
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,320
Hewlett Packard made an estimate what it
would cost it for a better def

637
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,180
design for the environment and there are
our exit there are

638
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,200
green PC's market out there I haven't
read the fine print

639
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,740
but the parmi echo in i'ma call Dublin

640
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,790
are biodegradable components toxic
materials

641
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,990
so it's a good question you know how far
can you go for electronic components in

642
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,430
the answers while you could do something

643
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,649
you can't do everything it's not going
to be would reply you know or

644
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,160
by probably biodegradable obviously you
want to go as far as you can

645
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,640
and the good news is there are
improvements that could be made

646
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,118
and you can see the locker room for
improvement with all the companies that

647
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,760
aren't there yet

648
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,450
so for all of us in the field you know
how do we safety just discard you use

649
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,780
electronics

650
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,930
arm don't throw them in the trash

651
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,660
arm this is a great statistics on a
camera for the number but

652
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,710
even non technically savvy people like
us in the room

653
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,170
or the conference no because it was
valuable

654
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,210
when computers cost a lot of money years
ago and then was obsolete

655
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,109
didn't throw it away so they were tens
of thousands

656
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:52,348
computers you know 486 is 386 is
probably

657
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,030
you know sitting in people's basements
and garages

658
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,250
middle because they want to read it but
they have a vague idea that it's things

659
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,260
you know it's prolly toxic

660
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,859
arm so so at some point when these
programs really get rolling across the

661
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,150
country

662
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,440
is going to be a call to take get rid of
all these properly

663
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,700
but none of us should throw them in the
trash Dhoni for use as possible

664
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,580
it's not that old there's almost
anywhere you go in the country there's a

665
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,369
place that refurbishes

666
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:23,670
use computers and gives them or donate
some to

667
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,810
nonprofits if they don't use it
themselves again

668
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,660
46 royal to the much good if you've got
a p4 that you're replacing with

669
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,750
you know a dual-core something that that

670
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,010
that that has cancellable it useful use

671
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,300
there's any steward program that I'm not
that familiar with that with this map

672
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,720
comes from

673
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,180
wheres were is the recyclers who have
been

674
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:51,470
certified by some national group to do
it do the proper way

675
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,540
that's not exclusive but that's
something to keep in mind

676
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,250
are you can try that manufactures
recycling free recycling programs

677
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,240
again there you have to read the fine
print and some the mark free

678
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,150
even if they say they're free but arm

679
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,250
Best Buy and staples I know staples
trying to do a lot more on this we had a

680
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:11,810
meeting

681
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,720
was the Clean Water Action with them in
Massachusetts five years ago

682
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,890
and they were seriously considering
setting up a massive

683
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,259
collection program to say hey bring
yours bring your use computers staples

684
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,400
and will recycle them for free and they
decide not to do it I mean they still

685
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,609
I think the support it was a business
decision

686
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:36,060
the pp explain to us you know because
it's it's space in the in the stores

687
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,940
but the reason to do it business-wise
you know that people would be coming to

688
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,080
the stores

689
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,270
disposing electronics me will you be
buying more electronics

690
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,619
so there's still potential movement
movement that way

691
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,540
and I'm getting ready to wrap up here
arm EP or does work

692
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,839
arm the EP our programs accept
responsibility for

693
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,759
for e-waste para still relatively new
2004

694
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,010
the requirement started to go into
effect in europe

695
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,750
the laws in the US are less than two
years old most States

696
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,790
on mean in California well

697
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:16,900
are the oldest main anyway on and so I
look very carefully for any studies

698
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,619
and I asked my the people used to work
with for for rum

699
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,690
in various national group on this issue
you know what studies exist

700
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,460
on om showing

701
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,140
how effective it is a handful like five
studies

702
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,940
others that one comparing me in
California just looked at

703
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,680
to the best extent they could the per
capita recovery

704
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,169
which actually was even but then what
did manufacturing costs and and

705
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,329
processing cost which show that mean was
doing much better

706
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:51,030
arm but then Thomas link West the guy
who founded this back in the early 90's

707
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,270
they still working on the issue and he
and some

708
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,560
a academics from Japan and other
countries have done a series

709
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,140
studies with a look at the question da
has

710
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,560
EP are requirements where they have
existed for more than a few years

711
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,910
for electronics and other products have
they met their goals

712
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,980
the key one key goal being drive product

713
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,970
improvements more recyclable less toxic
et cetera

714
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,170
and one finding a pulled out is a
Japanese

715
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,710
Japan Japan has a mandatory arm I don't
know how long it's been effective

716
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,240
military we

717
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,510
type directive requiring manufacturers a
take-back

718
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,910
financial responsibility for electronic
waste

719
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,589
and apparently before the law became do
fact the Japanese manufacturers and and

720
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:42,060
people sold in the country looked at

721
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,640
you read the law and did make some
changes

722
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,299
for the further ones in the you know in
their country

723
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,140
and the replace plastic housing with
mackney magnesium alloy

724
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,180
because they trouble with the plastic
recycling arm

725
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,990
my favorite example as well as an older
one at the terrible product if you're a

726
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,780
environmentalists which I used to be the
working at other Kodak

727
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,150
with their used to call disposable
cameras

728
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,280
well than they call them want to
scammers

729
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,530
om but it's actually a success story

730
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,280
this this is the the ultimate goal fork
Center produce responsibility

731
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,490
or for materials management for the
environment

732
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:27,530
where manufacturing is doing things the
right way it's not a cradle

733
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,000
to grave system is a cradle to cradle
system

734
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,230
okay so so the ultimate expression

735
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,980
extended producer responsibility is when
the manufactures financially responsible

736
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,470
for the entire life cycle the product

737
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,570
which usually means you know it's
produced

738
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,160
its it goes in the supply chain sold
it's used

739
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,490
and then the the user does something
with it they give it a recycler the

740
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,500
disposal but whatever

741
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,750
soco's disposal recycling because at the
end it's over

742
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,280
the best system is what it is it's a
real circle recycling is not a circle

743
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,849
okay you know you think a bit with the
circle simple

744
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:10,359
but its it is it's a circle at the ends
or something they take a product in the

745
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:11,770
take it apart

746
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,250
in the canal things down they can reuse
other things

747
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,430
but it's not always used to make the
same product you could go to other

748
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,240
things

749
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,579
then you get a degradation is only so
many times you can do that

750
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:26,369
so what kodak is done with eighty-four
percent recycling rate

751
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:30,869
which is probably the best you can do
because they make the product

752
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:35,560
intentionally from the same product that
comes back to them

753
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,720
in its unique product okay you probably
can't do this almost any other kind a

754
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,780
product because it's a one use camera

755
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,750
those are probably going out of style
mister you know because I digital

756
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,030
cameras but

757
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,810
you can still buy them people so use
them who don't want to go into the

758
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:49,859
digital world

759
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:53,970
but so ticked so to get developed you
you return the tire camera

760
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,280
so they get the camera back but the
camera that you buy

761
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,849
new is made partially recycled materials

762
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:04,280
so it's a complete is a complete circle
to Cradle to Cradle system is called

763
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,369
inverse manufacturing

764
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:09,650
and its very well written on this and
every time I try to bring it up to

765
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,650
up University folks people work in the
issue the shake their heads no

766
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,480
don't go there but this is the ultimate
thing so what if HP

767
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,060
when they make their computer you know
and you disposable are you done with it

768
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,130
you discard the workers which uses
discard

769
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,109
that they used to make more computers
know if there's a limit to that because

770
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:32,450
as we know sup not everything is is
recyclable

771
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,070
are the same way but maybe

772
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:40,770
you know for other products that make
sense carpets gypsum wallboard

773
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,030
the best thing to make chips have all
brought it was all gypsum wallboard

774
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,930
cuz because it it's a you know it's a

775
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:51,000
it's a paper strip been a cardboard and
it just

776
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,099
this powder basically that's glued
together and in massachusetts we try to

777
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:57,359
get better recycling have shipped in
cardboard

778
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,660
because was causing orders and sold in
in in landfills

779
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,868
and so the the the state talk to the
manufacturer's

780
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:06,740
all three them that were in the new
england and they said we okay will pick

781
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,530
up

782
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,480
so they had all the developers were as
much as possible set up special bins for

783
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,880
the gypsum wallboard

784
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,200
used to make more gypsum wallboard so
get this is not universally applicable

785
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,970
but thats ultimately what we're talking
about to reduce adrenaline packed but

786
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:21,570
also

787
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,990
reduce the cost for for municipalities
and

788
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,310
have a complete circle um

789
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,500
life cycle the product so

790
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,050
arm conclusions up every once in awhile
i

791
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,880
or patron saint recycling your waste
management I suppose

792
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,140
the the doing it the old fashion way

793
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,500
if you're is still being proposed others
about 20 other states in the US were

794
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,720
like Massachusetts where been successful
for ten years ago to pass

795
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,570
are but other states work still being
proposed there may be efforts the

796
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,910
national level

797
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,220
India Australia up Canada has a number

798
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,270
provinces who were doing it for many
products

799
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,190
on but there's talk about a national
legislation there Israel

800
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,230
arm so it's its its ongoing

801
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,020
and I've been working on it since 1999
unit fighter take up the US two years

802
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,880
ago

803
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,609
arm and across the world everyone's
European the wealth

804
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:19,730
and its and its it's being seen is the
way to go

805
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,859
in all the major companies are falling
in favor of it so for more information

806
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:27,589
I'll I didn't want to need not they can
you put the web sites but look for the

807
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:29,759
electronic kickback campaign

808
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,609
the Silicon Valley talks Institute the
product Policy Institute

809
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:37,799
Clean Water Action and my email search
on have a Comcast dotnet

810
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,740
if I can answer any questions

811
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,990
question

812
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:52,990
okay any questions

813
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:02,670
right

814
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,440
the other questions about cell phones
that for over two years

815
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,780
or so and what happens to them arm

816
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,070
unnoticed knowledgeable on cell phones
there's

817
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,490
is hundreds of thousands if not millions
the cell phone suppose Ive ever year

818
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,720
and your most places and the place to
discard them

819
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,490
so they'll go on the waist arm I don't
know what happened to them

820
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:30,120
but thats some some state laws are

821
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,520
intentional you know look including
those in the PR laws because they're

822
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,690
in terms of the number units that it
blows away anything else

823
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,730
so there needs to be a tension to cell
phones that

824
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,580
you know for for a cell phone there
isn't much talk securely computers a

825
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,520
computer but

826
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,150
it adds up it adds up the same way no

827
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,620
batteries the questions about batteries

828
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:00,759
okay on that's one of the we don't look
at a Massachusetts

829
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,750
and some other New England states art is
a voluntary battery program

830
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,570
are run by the industry that has a
terrible track record

831
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:12,320
course every time we talk about
recycling batteries

832
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,390
switcher commit which are toxic in many
cases lithium-ion

833
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:20,109
um other ones arm there's a state was
not national law passed

834
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,840
during the Clinton administration
preempts local laws

835
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,410
requiring battery recycling arm

836
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,680
in gave a preference to this to this
voluntary program

837
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,649
that there the statistics show isn't
working

838
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:39,250
arm so there's there's some is movement
on that with the national group trying

839
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,200
to get something done

840
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,940
at the national level to change that on
most

841
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,530
like COD battery should be thrown away
but the the really high

842
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,170
high powered ones like an laptops
whatever can't

843
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,090
and on so when you discard the laptop
that goes with it

844
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:00,120
I don't really know what happens at that
point questions

845
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,259
okay thank you
