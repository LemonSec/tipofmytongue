104
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,979
is to think that we are you part-time
its yes

105
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,409
so what we need is more drama and the
best way to tell the story of the

106
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:05,599
WikiLeaks

107
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,419

109
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,990
it's a huge controversy and we like
controversy especially if it's about

110
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,709
hackers

111
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,120
and some people I talk to many legacy
they think well

112
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:33,120
I feel isolated and I don't know what to
do and our whole posse some 1990s n

113
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,959
we can do it

114
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,979
we are important and we have to sing
about its

115
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,169
so I didn't have enough time to rights

116
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,938
a new song but I thoughts I mean we are
in

117
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:51,189
0 unicorn or in america

118

perfect

119
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,249

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,399
so we like unicorns and of course

123
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,249
especially miss the lame-o we like
america okay so

124
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:16,310
America by two-way

125
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,779
is a an NHA of pretty much underrated

126
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,349
folk rock bands from the 70s and 80s

127
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,709
and Dave wrote a song about a unicorn n

128
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,099

132
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,730
and it's sold rich in metaphor

133
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,329
its perfect when the last eagle flies

134
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,430
America or like non America or Europe

135

271
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,710
mom there never his fault

272

273
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,890
during the weekend but we will talk

no drinking in Segway now I will tell
you that right now alright

276
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,080
let me get to this long time ago there
was hope

277
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,490
anybody here that was at the first the
okay

278
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,130
we have been beyond hope we've survived
h2k and we were worried that two years

279
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,040
ago

280
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,100
thanks to you where you go that

281
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,320
there was going to be the last hope we
in the community have married divorced

282
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,658
and started on the next generation I've
seen so many kids in here in

283
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,990
those parents who brought their kids to
this conference man that's just

284
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,850
that for the

285
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,190
he every conference

286
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,769
besides running security I get to watch
the crowds I get to listen to the talks

287
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:17,120
and I've watched her community grow are

288
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,600
influence its belt in most segment
society today who probably don't even

289
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
realize with their

290
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,200
our community this whole time has gotten
a chance to raise their voice and say

291
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,590
enough is enough

292
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,059
about hidden agendas

293
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:38,389
and how the world is being run there
used to be a

294
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:42,850
Hollywood think they did movie I can't
remember which one it was

295
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:47,610
some hollywood movie about the hacker
generation yet that that's

296
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:53,230
started this cry hack the planet it's
been jokingly been answered for decades

297
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,159
ever since

298
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,320
the truth really is we own the fucking
planet

299
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,320
the that's it that's all I get for this

responsibility

301
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:16,640
in some way shape or form to change the
planet for the better

302
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,730
every little thing that you do

303
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,160
no matter how insignificant you think it
is plays into the bigger picture

304
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,630
either good or bad if you've watched
some the talks have been appalled

305
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,600
it's time for you to make your voice
heard those if you work in technology

306
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,760
you know what we basically

307
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,390
all those people with iPhones and
everything else out there have us to

308
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,210
blame for

309
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,210
either the problems the misuse of
Technology

310
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,440

311
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,900
a billy use that technology for the
better to keep people who would normally

312
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,780
have their genders hidden

313
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,100
and away from us out into the light

314

skeletons in my closet there now either

315
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,220

320
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,779

AV stuff here a at

322
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,629
and I think that's probably the

323
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,480
the best year we've had freebie stuff
since I started things went really

324
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,230
smooth we don't have any real problems

325
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,030
trucks actually started showing up early
we play at noon and i got a call

326
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,889
10 a.m. before it was even here saying
about front at send him away and I just

327
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,680
hope they come back later when they're
supposed to

328
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,920
number ever everything went well where
he got one room torn down over there and

329
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,180
we're gonna start on the second floor
soon as we're done appear

330
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,560
so I think things are really smooth and

331
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,600
all in all all that's really do the
volunteers we've we've got it on a good

332
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,220
people

333

I really stuck with us this time I'll

334
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,860
in you know pass some time we've had
people disappear

335
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,110

everything went really well we had

336

for things um

338
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,490

all the queer nation the crew on site

339
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,680
and keep everything running

340
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,680
is what Adam does so and entries on here

341
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:57,620
for I only got a couple my volunteers in
the room at the moment because as Chris

342
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,970
just mentioned

343
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,000
we're actually almost done taken down
levels already now

344
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,419
bells been struck for over an hour so

345
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:12,830
it to happen if you haven't had an
opportunity to get involved with the

346
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,809
conference yet

347
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:18,399
right after closing ceremonies is your
opportunity everything you see

348
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,600
has to go green and things on the hotel
of course

349
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,220
but and so we

350
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,870
we can use a very large crew in parallel
to be able to take down all the sound

351
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,679
lighting

352
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,879
arm screens everything you see here

353
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:37,909

oliver volunteers cuz you guys been
great special show to red beard he

623
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,920
brought me dinner one night

624
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,450
as I can leave the table %uh so for the
top volunteer

625
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,700
want to put in just ridiculous numbers
hours on

626
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,390
we have special price: and so

627
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,540
is Nick said we're asking people to put
in 10 hours to get a volunteer teacher

628
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,029
so this guy enough hours get for
volunteer t-shirts

629
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:14,130
and then maybe like a small shirt on the
side forty four and a half hours

630
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:17,770
in three days well I guess you count
Thursday four days

631
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,160
so there's a little bit of a story
behind this

632
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,430
this award know many people call the
hotel asking for the conference rate

633
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:31,410
and were told they couldn't get it and
so we found out about this

634
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,529
website the people were using to get and
couldn't recall

635
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:39,150
easy quick travel dot com now they have
you guys use that website

636
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,430
so

637
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:47,350
apparently so many people are using it
they found out who these people were

638
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,360
good trying all stay at the hotel
Pennsylvania for this rate

639
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,970
and started contact us and

640
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,290
so violent the volunteers email got one
of these

641
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:02,380
these contacts we said oh yeah I will
take this thing you want

642
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,580

643
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,940
that's what we're gonna give to our top
volunteer

644
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:15,940

647
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,210
forty four and a half hours being an
awesome volunteer

648
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,220
rex is going to have a free

649
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:45,220
three-day two night stay at the
Excalibur Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas

650
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,770
it's really shiny to

651
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,780
thank you again all the volunteers you
guys both in great

652
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,130
and congratulations Tariq thank you

653
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,420
I

654
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,430
if I get an opportunity I just like to
say a few things

655
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,790
from I volunteered a lot because a I
don't like to stand still

656
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,529
and I

657
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,550
only sleep like four hours at a time so

658
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,900
had a lot of free time and I spent a lot
of that time with a second-place red

659
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,820
beard who

660
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,820
it's actually very capable and counted
volunteer

661
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,560
and now I'm once I realized is
mathematically impossible for him to

662
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,340
beat me

663
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:41,340
II then went to sleep so

664
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,280
so in the future if the name want more
hours they just need to

665
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,290
from have one or two volunteers sleep

666
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,250
way less and that should improve

667
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:03,250
everyone else's performance

668
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:10,199
now for hours I I'm envious

669
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:13,789
so I my name's Mitch and

670
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:17,319
my main task for this one is ringling
people for the hackerspace village

671
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:19,319
setting up the hardware hacking area

672
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,069
and it was the amazing experience

673
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:28,299
when I went to my first tech conference
in phnom 2006 hopes 6

674
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:32,559
here four years ago I had no idea that I
was gonna be working with all these

675
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:33,419
people that

676
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:37,098
created the amazing experience that
changed my life forever

677
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:40,249
coming together from

678
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:46,039
Wow you know I was tears filled my eyes
cuz I I was part of a tribe that felt

679
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:46,380
like

680
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,969
mine hours would create this together

681
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:54,359
it's totally amazing an being able to

682
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,969
give that back and help create that
experience for

683
00:45:57,969 --> 00:46:01,380
countless other people is just so

684
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,559
gratifying and being part of the
hackerspace village where hackers bases

685
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:09,099
were represented from all around the
world

686
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,179
um you know it's all about community

687
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:17,469
we all play our part we share we learn
we grow and magic happens

688
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:21,479
we had a little taste that here %uh
throughout the conference

689
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:25,269
the hackerspace village in the hardware
hacking area was a little microcosm that

690
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:26,019
for me

691
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:29,140
but so many people whose first
conference was

692
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,449
the next OTP came up to me

693
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:36,079
I am a at the hardware hacking area and
were

694
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,400
saying basically what I just told you
about my first experience they came here

695
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,099
and felt

696
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:43,630
for the first time in their life an
introverted geek being part

697
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,509
a tribe that they felt at home in it's
really beautiful and we all did that

698
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:49,179
together

699
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:52,689
we all play our part it's really amazing

700
00:46:52,689 --> 00:46:59,689
here

701
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,400
and that's the power that we all hang
out we all have way more power than we

702
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,160
ever thought

703
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,390
or Todd so you know from here

704
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,999

733
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:02,650
this event in my searle the

734
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:11,070
as I think mitch implied I used to dream
of getting four hours a sleep per night

735
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,970
I don't know that I've dreamed much
these last two nights and I

736
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:18,140
and I wonder somehow I this clocking a
hours

737
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,490
are all this crew we started mostly most
people even hearing from mostly and I

738
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,830
december/january

739
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:27,779
putting this together this hundreds
hundreds hours and we're all volunteers

740
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,240
but it's not just us it takes on

741
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,830
a village it takes a tribe tribes good
word to up off on these and

742
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,850
I want to highlight is that this is very
much as you see in other areas of our

743
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,490
culture a meritocracy and you can make
it happen

744
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:48,650
by giving a talk volunteering armed and
how do you become

745
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:52,570
a a leader of some sort how do you come
up with the project i come up with an

746
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,040
area

747
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,790
well you're dreaming up you I talk about
it with people and you you put in the

748
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,860
effort to make it happen

749
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:02,640
and a huge thanks everyone has done that
already and also huge encouragement

750
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,750
to all love you that haven't yet maybe
taken that step

751
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,080
to to go ahead and take that take that
next step

752
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,170
so our last thing I want to say is I
don't think he's in here right now is a

smooth

766
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,970
and as I said it was not at all a solo
efforts so

767

hope to see again a couple years

768
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,480
I forgot to mention something we get new
this year

769
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,839
which was %ah the smart phone taps

770
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,490
how many people use these cargo naps
alright

771
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,579
that's a lot of people we have some some
stats here

772
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:29,319
I something like 602 32 people
downloaded the iPhone app

773
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,990
I there's an Android app to I

774
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:35,250
don't have exact number on that but 102
people downloaded the Android app

775
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,160
there is also a a a web alas app for a
Palm

776
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,180
up on phones and that was written by at
Andrew free

777
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,210
and the first two acts both of them the
iPhone app and the

778
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,630
I Android app for both written by
Michael E and it's amazing app I

779
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,170
I mean we're gonna have to do this again
because it's a allows it up stuffs

780
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,609
update stuff state you know in real time
or as the printed program me a few days

781
00:51:57,609 --> 00:51:59,790
in advance and it's always last minute
changes so

782
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:03,119
I don't agree get rid of a pretty
program but it's a it just really

783
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,500
adds a lot to the experience I am also I
just want to mention as far as logistics

784
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
and getting us for the time the great
prizes

785
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,270
I after we're breaking down go to the
Info Desk down on the mezzanine level

786
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,150
it just have to come up the escalators
and turn right that's for the empty desk

787
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,740
user thurman by the way did a fantastic
job there

788
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:26,140
I'm and if I thank him %ah so show up
there after I think 0 squared away

789
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,660
and you can claim your prize and one
last a

790
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:36,660
introduction to Nick Fargo is a few more
things to say and as most if you know

791
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:46,500
none of this would have been possible
I'm without the dream the vision and the

792
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,310
efforts

793
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,619
I love our conference chairperson a
manual Goldson given the huge round of

794
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:52,240
applause

795
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,720
the

796
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:03,720
here

797
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,450
I am so so happy that you're all alone

798
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,020
introduce yourselves and & Co whose
forget people am sorry when I forget

799
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,300
people's names and

800
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,109
don't thank them enough but yeah these
people and you people you're the ones

801
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:21,270
that made this happen

802
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,420
I'm simply the one who is stubborn
enough to say you know what this is

803
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,400
possible because

804
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,119
from the beginning the very first help
we're told it was impossible you can't

805
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,250
do this in

806
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,710
the state you certainly can't do this in
New York in a hotel what are you crazy

807
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:39,010
but 1994 we had a stubborn dream and we
for filled it right here

808
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,160
in this room in the room next door we
had one track two days

809
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,720
and a buncha computer setup here that
was it but it was still the biggest

810
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,720
hacker conference in American history in
1994

811
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,060
and since then of course things have
grown there are many have conferences

812
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,578
now

813
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:59,579
are but I think this was the best I
really do the

814
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,550
I I say that not just because I'm
involved with this one because I see the

815
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,420
spirit here in the spirit reminds me

816
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,570
what I see overseas I when I went to the
Dutch

817
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:16,490
meetings and conferences back in the
late eighties and early nineties

818
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,240
that's what inspired me to say this has
to happen in the States

819
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,900
this kinda spirit has to come here and
what you guys have done is you've you've

820
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,880
brought this cycle elective spirit

821
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,020
have curiosity knowledge sharing
education experimentation

822
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,660
mischief all that to these halls and
you've done it in such a positive

823
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:39,990
and and II attractive way to other
people to outsiders everybody wants to

824
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,170
be involved in this now

825
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:44,890
and that's a tremendous achievement and
that's something that I think I

826
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,200
you all deserve a lot of credit for some
please give yourselves a round of

827
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,180
applause for what you've done

828
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:56,180
to this day people tell me

829
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:02,600
are not too not to expect the whole lot
that all kinds of things can go wrong

830
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,790
for instance

831
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:09,540
you can actually sell tickets online
using credit cards to a bunch of hackers

832
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,580
what are you crazy to this day people
can believe that

833
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,130
the 2600 store exist online that we
actually trust people

834
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,870
we know we had something like at 1500
1600 free registrants

835
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,390
to the conference and everything one
time use the credit card you know I

836
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,910
means this is a fraud we had

837
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:30,220
one one instance and we're waiting for
that person to show up

838
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:36,830
they they they were especially routine
for and the program to flash a

839
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,130
particular color when that person tried
to register

840
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,360
but they never shut up unfortunately and
has a lot to waste our

841
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,050
smoke but we have fun with these things

842
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,330
are another another instance was a the
the very controversial panel we had this

843
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,170
afternoon

844
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:55,780
lot of people said that's gonna be
mayhem people can handle this kinda

845
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,210
thing

846
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:59,250
and I think the hacker community is well
equipped to handle the most

847
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,570
controversial issues

848
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,920
and listen to people with most
outrageous opinions and come to an

849
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,790
educated

850
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:07,820
a decision have their own as to how to
handle it

851
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:12,160
so I write thank people for just a I
being open to this

852
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:19,160
restoration here

853
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,240
now I don't know we're gonna be in two
years

854
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,220
and hopefully number nine can take place
here but we'll have to see if the hotel

855
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,800
cooperates and stay standing but for the
hotel that's here now

856
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,940
I want to thank them for being
tremendous to us letting us do our crazy

857
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:42,940
things

858
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,839
and if any of you out there have the
capacity to save this place know people

859
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,229
who do millionaires billionaires a funny
one

860
00:56:51,229 --> 00:56:56,319
within the sound of my voice can can the
lend some expertise or or just help out

861
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,140

stupid and own office tower here we

863

866
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:13,940
is that every voice matters and together

well-rounded program

amorphous to than ever before how many

883
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,890
people it's a good question

884
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,000
I don't know if we know exactly
somewhere over the 2000 mark

885
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
not that range a good crowd thousands
yes

886
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,829
not over 9000 up

887
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:30,109
as a little too much but we like each
and every one of you and

888
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:33,790
we want to thank people for just
behaving in such it's such a great way

889
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:34,130

outside the hotel in the city I up on 84

hope possible that's what makes our

893
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:58,069

898
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:19,569
they tell us things are impossible
alright

899
