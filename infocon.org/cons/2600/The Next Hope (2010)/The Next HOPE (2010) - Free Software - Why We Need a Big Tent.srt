00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,090
Foundation is all in clinical organizing
so

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,180
I worked a lot on free speech issues
similarities axis in the political

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,920
process

13

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,329
and organize all kinds things make
things easier

19
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,309
on you can have less paper in your
physical mailbox and instead have lotsa

20
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,340
span in your virtual mailbox

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,740
and of course now on the other chance
that we live pictures of cats

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,850
short-circuit to you et cetera an

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,640
in if you look back at the computers
primary function in our society was

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,180
gonna be

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,780
10 enhanced power human minds man

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,180
and status I like is going great

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,310
like we were never gonna have to like
physically shop again

28
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,310
an account a great stuff

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,310
and Sydney happened it was like

30
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,189
you know we have like a like virtual
reciente research assistants and

31
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,270
were able to track all kinds D-day that
we went beyond just hold in our heads

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,850
and prefers not to turn out to be really
useful for group

33
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,780
I'm still running a really large
business or running in government are

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,750
currently eating lots

35
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,100
information and I'm producing news which

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,950
has a lot to do with the way that we run
our society

37
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,750
and political fashion you can use
software to track legislation and urs

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,679
congress watch I'm you can use it to
share your opinion with your community

39
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,239
and you can use it to organize people
politically i sat on them

40
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,349
you know he discussed coming out or
we're going on and the State House on

41
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:16,970
Friday

42
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm so we suffered interact in ways that
we use to use

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,680
on to enact on offline so speaking
freely and assembling freely which are

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,580
I in the Bill of Rights am at

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,980
this and dessert two things we use to
exercise free injuries exercise

46
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,500
an offline and now main mechanisms that
we use

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,810
exercise those freedoms are online so

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,430
the online thing is controlled by
whoever controls

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,750
technologies that means that those free
has become meaningless

50
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,860
and methods are controlled by our
government our people

51
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,349
are you know there's honors thing about
government corruption so whatever

52
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,480
this in the democracy actually has the
potential work

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,079
an cell before computers and %um now if
someone must have really amount last

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,140
tracking your movements and he would
have been like

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,810
who is that guy like sitting down at the
end of my driveway every day

56
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,930
she's creepy anaconda recent can you go
away

57
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,970
an so technology makes

58
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,810
invisible surveillance past actually
trying to scare you enticing someone is

59
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,790
reading your email

60
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,829
right now on but technology does exist
to do it without your knowledge

61
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,140
I'm sure everyone here is where in fact
there might have been a talk

62
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,019
and some anything six African in
addition to and democracy

63
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,409
could be important for some really it
could be important for some really big

64
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:46,980
things

65
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,170
on so in these are some other things
folks use

66
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,560
suffer for I'd like to think maybe you
know

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,830
were we're looking at killing suffer for
time travel

68
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,939
solving world hunger and peace on earth
am again

69
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:04,420
very important to have everybody's
participation and involvement

70
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,769
so financing is it suffers power sign

71
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,349
matters a lot who controls your machine
South running on

72
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,370
I'm and just %uh a little bit

73
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,880
an worry about the word power

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,079
and to wait backwardness

75
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,300
defied are 95 at demonized yes

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,800
and in our society is really dangerous
because

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,020
and this one am

78
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,198
powers just means getting things done

79
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,780
an it doesn't have to like turning evil
you know

80
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,690
it's not like I had hitler and

81
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,810
card ballots it it means getting shit

82
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,050
cell I'm Frederick Douglass abolitionist

83
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,340
and you know people people ask him even
in his work like

84
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,270
that's gonna on people and the
inconvenient everywhere in his like

85
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,430
yeah that is what's gonna happen an

86
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,050
powers can a second make retaking powers
can upset the apple cart

87
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,530
Sam am unintentional pun the apples

88
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,830

Steve Jobs

91
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,660
saying here I had ellis et

92
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,930
you're not giving any control to the
user knock

93
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,710
that's a it's a walled garden and that's
bad for freedom

94
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,570
mean I'll let you know thank you people
like their devices in their

95
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,800
they're definitely pretty an but thats

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,289
that's what I mean I say we can't
flights from coming out power

97
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,759
so on his anyone here does an icicle
free suffer shirts and

98
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,250
and three staffers the freemen program
for any purpose

99
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,350
he said in change it an

100
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,620
you can share at happys happy neighbor
and you cannot sorry just you read

101
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,750
cokie's and your modified versions to
others Senate's

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,069
you know the GPL una noche an

103
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,020
in our TDI axis in the source code
copyleft license

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,750
an axe free suffers controlled by a
worldwide community of users

105
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,220
here's an and this is a bit ly

106
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,009
yet we can talk about democracy a little
bit an

107
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,139
band it just turns out to be like kind
of handy

108
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,729
like human knowledge is porn actor mr.
calendar functions

109
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:30,050
on ok people I think so enjoy reading
like-for-like stuff

110
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,380
and don't have to you an and

111
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,900
we have individuals are valued over
monopolies sound

112
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,350
and and his motto with proprietary
software

113
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,039
it sounded like a bean counting and
keeping track of code and where it's

114
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,340
going and honest

115
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,910
an in a free suffer model it's more
about like what you now and what you're

116
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,270
able to do so

117
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,008
especially like customization or support
model an

118
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,699
its its definitely about the individual
and the relationship between an

119
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,880
individual on the person after having
out the software

120
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,060
an and went on to a slight I'm freezing
intellectual property which can I

121
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,360
transfer toothpaste back into the two

122
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,270
an

123
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,930
as a free suffer in a nutshell I is
distributed power

124
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,650
and I think and thats that a kind power
than I i can get behind

125
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,449
that's what I'd like to see so an

126
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,690
Amiens everyone's participation is
needed you can't distributed power

127
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,030
there's only one person willing to be
empowered

128
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,120
so an soon

129
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,360
this is another conference Alinsky solid
excuse and kind of considered the father

130
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,550
community organizing an he and

131
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,400
here a lot on organizing low-income
people and endure a lot about his

132
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,740
techniques and he was very successful

133
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,900
an so learning about starting

134
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,280
an from where we actually are so

135
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,160
cranny we think are some Cesar some

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,099
polls show that for staffers maybe like
two or three percent

137
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,539
desktop market crash that's how I am a
little less because

138
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,849
machinist actually pay me for again he
lacks operating system

139
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:17,650
but an there's no it's keeping free
staffers definitely in the minority

140
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,379
to pretending that and only people knew

141
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,060
and they would be over here using the
free software

142
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,240
and because thats that's what they
should be doing

143
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,649
is not gonna happen third still wanna be
forced to use when is where for a long

144
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,779
time and

145
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,849
am we need to accept that and and Scott
from match race

146
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,000
cell an we need a credit freeze half man

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,040
and an already did I think we need to
reach beyond the folks who are already

148
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,199
here

149
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,149
an with how I have make

150
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,480
I'd say FSF membership is probably like
ninety five percent

151
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,089
sys admins holders so we've done a good
job

152
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,630
of penetrating that affects

153
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,010
an so just to talk about Lakers the free
stuff from

154
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,610
now I'm glass houses study a couple
years ago

155
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,880
and hopefully it's getting a little
better but still and even three times

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,630
this number would be pretty

157
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,640
low and its lower than the number is for
proprietary software

158
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,430
tonight 20 to 25 percent women

an semana when you when you look at this
list you can see like

239
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,500
specifically why you know like persons

240
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,060
people with disabilities would be
particularly interested in

241
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,480
and useful and free software coating
process because

242
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,750
ever really specific needs for software
to

243
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,800
an and especially like to see are people
that dont

244
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,790
identify as computer people in the first
half

245
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,819
and that's gonna take a little bit
retooling

246

going we talk about the trees of and
syntax and share now

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,709
in net with a specific call I am
building

273
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,050

I'm gonna go and eateries and

275
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,199
and soon yet to define what your goal is
if your goal is to get your local

276
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,160
library to use free software

277
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,300
and the public kiosks then that's what
is so when you invite people riney say

278
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,029
were forming a group to get free saffir
on the palate kiosks

279
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:56,040
act like an and ask I don't like weird
but like a lot of times people transit

280
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,259
who were gonna hang out next Thursday
something about 1x maybe

281
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:05,360
and then night by anyone show up her why
did they only come for the snacks

282
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,449
and sale in addition to once you figure
out what your messages

283
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,339
you need it stay on your message and be
a friend about your call

284
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,609
Lake an I don't know if you an

285
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,980
I have you ever serve now even a large
city and had a really nice person but

286
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,270
you for Peter

287
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,559
somewhere and then you're like now 2pc
non-personal

288
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,740
people are super nice and you found it
was

289
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,840
just they want you to come to church and
there isn't even that much Peter

290
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,889
so to fetus which cousin people on
actually stick around if you're gonna go

291
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,910
to all the trouble and my people for

292
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,669
something then invite them for reaction
for

293
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:48,210
an

294
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,000
an still in scene change
attention-getting

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,120
an measures I'm actually relieved like
it might be super fun

296
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,539
to ride mister pena but

297
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:04,049
if you're trying to get folks to come to
a free saffir activist group

298
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,230
there you're going to get people that
are just coming from the right mister

299
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,820
pena

300
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,110
so tracks like the attention getting
stuff Mac

301
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,080
for instance we have a again you cast an
actor suffered house

302
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,260
to which is Mac

303
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,320
am

304
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,100
pictures later me and then separate out
distractions

305
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,400
if your goal is to you

306
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,350
again i cant like a Montessori School
let me be your organizing your honor my

307
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,470

311
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,740

nice I see just

312
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,100
takeover that agenda and get them are to
come to like this

313
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,080
event to do it at my communist

314
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,250
now just invite separately

315
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,039
sheep that separately you know sent stay
on target

316
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,820
an still events or meetings these are
really good because it is a specific

317
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,370
time and place to focus on

318
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,549
you can unite RC meeting FX thats

319
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,590
you're not geographically in the same
place and face meeting is really good

320
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,659
if you can't you face to face meeting
because the geography when you start I

321
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,580
suggest at least you're not found
conference call thing

322
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,740
kazakh 11 nuance laypeople on top

323
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,120
i gets lost and to trust and I'm

324
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,429
and when year looking for folks to work
on something you really excited about it

325
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:37,929
could you know who else is actually
excited

326
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,970
an even us know if you have a hike

327
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,059
a lot of you folks coming at once and in
Cuttack

328
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,070
weirdness just have 1 percent like

329
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,250
so an cleansing seige new

330
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,840
movie did a lot of work to build up
their community and

331
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,520
an and bring the needle like how many
women are involved and they said

332
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,580
best thing was to make sure that they
weren't invading new women to

333
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,510
participate like

334
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,049
one at a time and I was really weird
because they be the one

335
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,450
women in their late 20 dudes there and

336
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,590
but leak that can be weird for anyone
it's like now it's twenty people who

337
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,799
don't know each other

338
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,100
and me so you know a big

339
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,270
as a player and in at vina weeding
weirdness

340
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,330
how to create an someone's house is

341
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,240
is kinda strange for an

342
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,120
and tasty police snacks like a Saxon
shadow your ultimately

343
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,350
an keep in mind

344
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,100
you know its you don't want people not
coming cuz I like I'm hungry sounds good

345
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,740
whenever and have planned disorganized
and encourage people come back for

346
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,799
second meeting

347
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,090
an so turning and then about like
thinking about who you're inviting

348
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,668
an so if you wanted to start a group at
your school all

349
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,820
then you might make posters in pregnancy

350
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,990
cafeteria you might get the email
address for this yes to partner

351
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,770
an you probably wouldn't spend time
handing out flyers in front in the

352
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,480
supermarket in that town

353
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,580
Prince an

354
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,189
and so telling your approach as much as
possible and then repeating

355
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,210
my TV set one note to the CS department
saying like

356
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,960
we mean it's my he said hi us remind
people couple days in advance

357
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,789
and you know it %uh so many things about
on

358
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,750
asking people to do things and then
click an event an

359
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,250
it's more useful to ask to see in person
three times

360
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,650
to come to something and asked three
people each wants

361
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,809
I know everyone likes to think like I've
heard the first time I got to check

362
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:45,600
everything

363
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,860
that's actually not have people an

364
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,720
an awesome on make a person not so high
now what folks here in training our

365
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,600
interest in an

366
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,010
and make a connection from them like why
would they want to come

367
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,129
and do this an

368
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,980
you know its and you might say like he
saw your

369
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,159
I see it live around the time when you
rather using free software

370
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,860
and send individualized asked people if
you can

371
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,059
and tax people in percent extended a No
like

372
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,200
you didn't just like pcca everyone and
invited like five hundred people like

373
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,960
you really want

374
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,860
and again repeating I'm repeating
repeating

375
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,090
an so you know that and they're here

376
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,970
how I an miss you rank meeting

377
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,280
an a good meeting has a couple different
components

378
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,928
has an agenda and sent

379
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:44,610
and and least we stick to the agenda

380
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,809
beyond play blown out tonight I yes yes
rebound Zealand for forty minutes and

381
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,080
then a

382
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,360
an talented people after the meeting

383
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,570
airlines that he just did one thing
that's really good and

384
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,460
meeting in sicily he's awake people like
about this meeting

385
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,900
and only you think we should change for
next time soon maybe some

386
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,820
sailing soon shop is nice but it's
really super loud on Thursdays cuz every

387
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,370
night

388
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,700
so we should maybe wednesdays are find
another location

389
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,320
and actually do that improve for next
time

390
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,820
an cummings 210 keep in mind about an

391
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,389
setting up an event army as your
introduction to PG+

392
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,830
every gathering like actress people this
insight

393
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,918
you're glad they're there because we
once you're here

394
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,770
and then thank people for coming and
give you people

395
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,559
something to do city no likey were not
one is projects

396
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,590
the team's here where we have too many
volunteers

397
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,000
weren't as congress where we really want
you can't make it

398
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,950
do in some stuff an and then actually
give people something

399
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,809
make sure you ask him about it later
like don't just give them my son Charlie

400
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:55,340
work

401
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,439
never follow cassettes not really gonna

402
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,909
be moaning an so ACI think

403
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:05,190
an new volunteers are you purchase a
pens

404
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:11,240
an as if you drink if you think a man
now anywhere chair Inc growl and water

405
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,860
an accent you now without me smothering

406
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,270
an a great way to this is serving a
little bit more

407
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,400
link pose like after people come no
couple meetings

408
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,650
an your service doing a leadership
development

409
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,380
I love it an while I'm

410
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,620
best way to do that is why once an see

411
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,669
you know you might say ray hits Alex
you've been coming to

412
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:42,419
make our free library meetings for a
little while and

413
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,120
you agree child those Flyers a supercar

414
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,150
an left tackle Matt Light how's that
going

415
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,630
did you enjoying the Flyers you wanted
two more fires or

416
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,640
would you ask you something out sore you
know has an account

417
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,870
and actually and then listen do anything
say

418
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,020
when people do these in an hour if
anyone in this room has

419
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,100
done this kind interaction

420
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,270
before but an the person you started the
group sense to be super excited about

421
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,870
highs and in the hand is the schedule
this meeting to talk

422
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,450
you volunteer about how it's going for
them and then they bombard them with an

423
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,440
hour and a half

424
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,929
how ass in the movement and how 3 all
the stuff they have planned

425
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:31,000
and then they have no idea when that
person is like I heat making Flyers

426
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,010
I only did it because no one else what
can I hitch

427
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,020
so you can ask and then you got a list
an

428
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,760
out and stay on topic with site and
again

429
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,590
it if you have a group that makes meet
socially as well

430
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,110
do it after the meeting see you have
like meeting somewhere

431
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,020
and then either separate place for beer
whatever

432
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,490
and use make separate make it just

433
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,140
just makes it better an so
anti-harassment

434
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,450
delegating so if you're leading the
group at the beginning

435
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,799
an you wanna be. delegating

436
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,330
so one person to get one person's worth
stuffed

437
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,620
to people YouTube person's worth of
stuff done and then you know

438
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,940
and so on and so on you can see how that
works out I'm work if

439
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,970
digital in that way so we talked about
like free stuff for being a minority

440
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,090
%uh desktop operating system and then

441
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,059
to her salameh really a huge way to go

442
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:34,270
so you think in that way works

443
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,908
in that direction to make that better
hundreds of times

444
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:42,020
and you'll still have work setting units
did you not like it's like happy

445
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,990
music or whatever an another reason to
tell a key

446
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,809
is I want what people call the bus
factors silly having people

447
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,690
could get hit by bus and then your
entire effort would be like completely

448
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,760
some an in a minute maybe a little
cramped but

449
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,220
an you could sink in. in a more positive
way

450
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,490
flake the I met someone super awesome
from England and I'm getting married and

451
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,370
moving there

452
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,929
factor if you the best thing is to Grand
Prix a

453
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,390
this acid burn-out factor or you know
can also be part

454
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,779
meaning want get married and

455
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:23,570
break people to choose much then it gets
really crazy and

456
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,668
a he really crazy and then they start
end dread

457
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:31,049
ugh I I took on my 500 things at the
last meeting

458
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,950
people are gonna wanna now if I did the
mom and so

459
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,630
it's not good an see

460
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,130
and tell ya sent ridge's documentation
see you might tell a geek 15 thing

461
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,429
like see you have Lake something

462
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,029
some category of work to do that you
have like 50

463
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:53,740
like maybe its bags maybe it's like
libraries we want a car

464
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,760
or whatever it is and so

465
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,230
instead of delegating each dusting
seeding like

466
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,710
I'm I think and crap last time I did

467
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,690
%uh saying and document

468
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,390
see intelligent easy and documentation
is great house

469
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,799
busting I am attacks

470
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,029
and so just to recap

471
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:22,529
high in time but how

472
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:25,590
huh hats ok not have questions

473
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,860
an to free safire distributed power

474
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,309
Anna checking cuz pressure mall to
clutched

475
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,879
monopolize power an Mar people I'm

476
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,539
different people see me good for the
free stuff for me

477
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:44,490
does any good for suffered South and
more people wanting to use it

478
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,520
an so and then invite people

479
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,330
thoughtful and repeatedly out when
anything said leon

480
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,820
I often think about up when where
recruiting people to do something that's

481
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,178
not a job

482
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,960
is that works or that time

483
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,240
actually has the same space if they
would normally spend on

484
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,890
social activities revenge now watching a
movie or whatever

485
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,399
so if it's onerous and people are rude
and no one appreciates them they're not

486
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,870
gonna keep coming back

487
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,740
his you aren't paying them and could
just watch

488
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,990
so keep that in mind night last chance
for people

489
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,080
activism occupies seem block

490
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,090
in their life that social stuff only one

491
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,799
an also share the work absolutely sure
the work

492
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,879
as much as you can often as you can and
in as many ways as you can

493
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,490
an 19 Olympic fun and

494
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,010
tends to happen for folks as they get to
the place where they have taken on

495
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,140
everything for sale

496
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,500
mom a feeling scant Dell Inc so

497
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,770
way before you get to that car make sure
you're sharing

498
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,230
work an its

499
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,899
YouTube once you've done it you'll see
it in action and it's super exciting

500
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,090
and you have to keep in mind that
they're not going to do it exactly the

501
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,299
way you would have done it that's not
the point

502
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,210
the point is that stuff is getting done
and now there's like three view working

503
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,860
full time getting something done

504
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,549
and eventually if you teach them to
delegate if you like six or nine are you

505
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,580
now

506
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,120
s financial an michel de after he tell
you that work

507
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,559
and recapping an that people are getting
something back

508
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,100
there you know an wanna things like

509
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,220
and you might discuss landlines

510
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,270
is like his cell your in school %uh Lake

511
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,529
are yes yes to create an account sign if

512
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:43,260
is this fitting and niche that you have
to build on fear career

513
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,740
or is this like you hate that job target

514
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,289
and like you like to be able to do
something we get to thinking

515
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,049
are treated like a monkey I find out
where where the

516
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:57,730
the stuff you're doing with people fits
in city you can kinda like

517
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,899
channeling right %um obviously tell you
different sorts of things to launch your

518
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:02,500
site

519
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,840
I have to put this on my resume and
Timberlake

520
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,700
I would do anything like the harder the
better I im gonna shoot myself in the

521
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,730
head and I worked

522
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,620
so to scan make sure you that people are
getting what they want

523
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,809
back out of the experience and then I
always always always be fast ring

524
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:23,809
leadership an excuse

525
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:27,580
%um that's that's how I'd biggest piece

526
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,039
an so now an open it up for questions

527
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,669
I try not to tell every single thing I
know about everything in here so

528
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:40,250
I could still answer questions

529
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,419
hi I'm there's a type of diversification
you didn't talk about

530
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:47,940
hoping you might have an opportunity to
discuss a little bit more for us

531
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,539
check on I'm leader of an open source
project that's very

532
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:55,940
happily the sea New York is actually
grant funding

533
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,340
we always would like to get more
community members but it's very

534
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,250
difficult to address the divide between
people who are being paid to do this

535
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,710
as part of their day job verses people
who don't and

536
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,730
trying to invite someone into that group
whenever I can say well I get a paycheck

537
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,000
but you're not

538
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,010
Zack very difficult thing she you speak
anything

539
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,950
yeah I can actually an cell

540
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:21,450
there is that and there's a way asserted
dovetail that way that's good

541
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,640
so I'm money-making said

542
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,140
people tend to do when they're in Lake a
paid per cent am a lot on Lake

543
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,070
work today nobody really wants to do and
sit in the Catholic

544
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,950
I'm picky person and they're like on any
right hear stuff like nine thousand and

545
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,450
last

546
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,559
and then I have 14 hours ago pecan tree

547
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,610
I'm don't do that that's that's

548
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:49,580
I'm I'm in a meeting a little bit
caricature city you can understand

549
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,809
michel de and so we one and now

550
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,210
political organizations I worked at we
would us before

551
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,640
a lot email we would send out these
little postcard action alerts

552
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,720
so I would have a volunteer has not been
paying a summer intern

553
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,399
nazi-like okay so at the end this you
are gonna put little postcard stamps on

554
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,140
about four hundred little postcard

555
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,490
but I want you to do the research I want
you to write up to text for the postcard

556
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,760
I want you to learn the layout software
and design a postcard

557
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,600
run if I mean you know it's complying
mentorship texting

558
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,000
and then they are so site to fight

559
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,179
little postcard stamps on this product
so if you can make

560
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,750
and projects like the whole thing think
athletes

561
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,279
something that's interesting and kinda
like allows them to grow and learn some

562
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,159
new things

563
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,700
in Kansas real responsibility along with

564
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,320
an you know monotonous stuff

565
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,519
that helps out a lot okay do you think
that there's

566
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,929
you know long-term viability for
building large communities in that same

567
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:54,409
sort of model

568
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,279
yeah really yeah ideal on

569
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,590
I mean its the tenors literature family
have unpaid folks like you might buy

570
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,419
them Peter

571
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:07,840
you might I'm you know not get all

572
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,960
her when they're goofing off for a few
minutes in staff

573
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,720
I i'm you I think you can bring in I'm
and hit folks

574
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,970
with paid folks to work on something
together yeah thanks

575
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:23,190
sure am on this might be a little bit
off topic about

576
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,220
free software big-tent but its clothing
closely related

577
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,119
in the last around twenty years there
has been a really dramatic

578
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,200
drop in the number of women involved in
computer science

579
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,750
and arm it seems really counterintuitive
because girls are weighing

580
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,399
more verbal than boys so things writing
code that sorta stuff seems like it

581
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,159
would be a thing would be peeling

582
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,020
to to women who are Mike looking at a
career choice in the matter

583
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,280
so I just warning if you know are or if
you've

584
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,619
if anybody else in the room has an
insight into what's gone on with women

585
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:56,909
in computer science

586
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:02,440
and I Mackenzie tapped now I love it

587
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,480
so thirst book it's called unlucky
clubhouse women in computer science

588
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,670
women computing and its from a four-year
study done at Carnegie Mellon University

589
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,770
for men 25-29

590
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,040
during which the increase their
commitment from seven percent to 42

591
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,099
percent

592
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,270
and they went from having an attrition
rate which is like quikrete

593
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,070
up twice that meant to be exact six men

594
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,950
Anders that there's a lot of advice and
like yours what we did

595
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,560
throughout the book and usually read it

596
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,480
unlocking the clubhouse its good book

597
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,240
but

598
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,200
yeah I it think that and and that's one
of the things I think as far as building

599
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,680
for movement that we're looking at and

600
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,339
refunds its credit card to get free
software two girls

601
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:59,210
and going lot that's really specific
task

602
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,859
hi Deb um I am also a former political
organizer turn

603
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:06,700
free software Organizer an and hearing
your stories

604
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,750
I don't wanna say I I disagree with your
philosophy is a little strong word but

605
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,089
harm

606
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:16,630
it in in the work that I and the folks I
work with are doing that the priorities

607
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,349
are totally different

608
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:21,750
and we've been very successful and

609
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,839
I can I could give example after example
and I was wondering

610
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,560
on a how how successful do you feel that
your approach

611
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,460
is and can you maybe give a quick case
study

612
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,560
I've how you think that your Ulinzi
style organizing has

613
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,740
worked out increase offer adding I'm

614
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,910
I'm not sign I'm massively speaking

615
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:47,140
te like specifically organizing and not
necessarily talking about

616
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:52,020
some other things are after a couple for
I'm

617
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,950
when he cut for for building like
accounting project

618
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,210
but that's now I am primarily interested
and I'm not primarily interested

619
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,690
actress I'm we've been using at seven on

620
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,470
I women's caucus at the Free Software
Foundation

621
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:11,800
and on I think that a lot I've seen a
lot of those strategies be useful on an

622
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,880
organizer center setting up free
suffering fans

623
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,410
said and making people feel invited and
then assume

624
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,180
by keeping track of them minutes we've
done a lot and different aspects and

625
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,819
for safire movements how Anaheim

626
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,250
completely answer your question if you
can if you just give a quick example

627
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,070
I love something that you can point to
to give a demonstration of why you think

628
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,829
that this

629
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,050
approaches successful I would peach yeah

630
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,349
ending up thing I had a message
transmission is the women's caucus and

631
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:47,570
for tougher handy send so I individually
invited every single person in there and

632
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,880
followed up and found out and found out

633
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,770
we run we have meetings each month and
and that's a growing

634
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,869
listen and growing group people

635
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:01,270
involved and and money back up a little
the women's caucus is a

636
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,520
initiative to increase women's
participation and free software said

637
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:04,950
that's

638
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,460
all activist not covering at

639
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,950
does that answer your question okay

640
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,040
thanks I am David I'm

641
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,910
actually member the GCC steering
committee and went to answer a little

642
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,339
bit

643
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:22,430
about the question i've the divide
between people who are paid to work on a

644
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,328
project and

645
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,540
check not that in our project

646
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,990
we see there's a lot of different
motivations for people to participate

647
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,130
in a project maybe four

648
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,660
just wine to gain some additional
expertise

649
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,569
be a part of a different community May
12

650
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,359
gain some experience to to get a job
they may want to

651
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,799
you BBB useful it if they remember are
you a student at the University

652
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,240
so there are a lot of different
communities that one can drop by

653
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,540
to participate and one shouldn't assume
that

654
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,690
that every potential members to see
motivation

655
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,480
as you should look for different ways
that the me want to participate

656
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,240
and can van a different facet different

657
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,800
aspect to the project with their
different backgrounds

658
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,200
that may not be about just getting paid
to do the work

659
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,570
yeah I agree and I I think it's just how
I

660
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,900
its also good get to keeping them in
mind the different kinds of tasks

661
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,579
and I am and gannett Oxford talked about
like making sure the year valuing

662
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:34,780
on and different kinds of tasks you
might have so

663
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,349
i think thats scan

664
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:42,910
I it was fun it can you it's interesting
to me that there sa for movements

665
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,060
for people to get burned out and stuff
from saddam get burned out

666
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,650
and apps for a future some lessons
learned from FSF

667
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:56,210
how to not get burned out in work
increased offer

668
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,579
huck as well so it seems like I mean not
to bring up our mess believe we've been

669
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:02,270
out in forever not getting burned out

670
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,380
not say what should be like a I

671
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,540
and I don't know if I can tell you how r
masters that

672
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,990
I'm still 8

673
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,800
as far as for now I think I'm tallying

674
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,150
definitely helps and like tell

675
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,089
I'm we have a lot of

676
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:26,099
projects that have been around for a
while like and

677
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,579
in Europe as a Tory and I'm when I talk
to fix it

678
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,940
and maintain a project and don't have a
commentator for a long long time

679
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,589
the pattern is Nasri like dates are you
reading the code so I nasa

680
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:42,470
be the maintainer Asian maintainer they
remain the maintainer

681
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,810
the sole maintainer for years and years
and years

682
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:50,328
and then stuff comes online anti fur
like you can't just have a tax

683
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:53,349
only website to get updated like every
two years

684
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:57,450
now like a Sydney and Lake writing a
website to their list of things

685
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,329
and I like are you should maybe send on
now tell give you an

686
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:04,609
when you have a new release cuz I'm
happy to work out a nice day night

687
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:08,140
%uh tonight adrean press release to my
list thanks

688
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,089
and then click on and on and on and on
to an Aryan Khan %um are all

689
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:17,810
they're not happy about that so if
they're delegating that task

690
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,990
then they've would be just doing the
things that they want it to the deli Inc

691
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,760
right how out and finding other people
that want to the other parks

692
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,609
and making sure that your gravitating
towards the parts that you wanted to use

693
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:34,400
so in center just quietly taking on shit
you don't want to do

694
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,760
don't do that Heights OH announces like
II

695
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,849
I left counting couple people out there
like that if you find line

696
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:47,560
treat them well and if you live in yeah

697
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,828
just had one more thing to your question
bucking bronco

698
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,829
notice that project says realistic goals
end up being more successful

699
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:59,339
you have this you know nebulous cool
creating something

700
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:03,089
fantastic everybody's gonna love in this
committee years ago ling

701
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:06,630
who's gonna fill might happen new
products

702
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,930
started but they were goals way to
create a text editor

703
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,359
compiler so if you set goals along the
way

704
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:20,270
achieve those its more minutes and to
keep going until you reach your final

705
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,730
yeah ass actually

706
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,780
its NYU the process organizing

707
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,030
like open source project for a bunch

708
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,869
master students and to think I'm
encountering

709
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:37,130
kinda funny that people have a lot of
trouble getting involved in open source

710
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,000
software

711
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,670
so I'm trying to find start I'm trying
to find project leaders

712
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,579
to kinda all the students here you know
given a walk throughs

713
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:48,839
give them a sign sago read this code
figure out this flood

714
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:51,520
and I'm really surprised I get some
people who think it's like the best idea

715
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,950
ever

716
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,400
but about half the people I talk to just
tell me find out you will never find

717
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,310
anybody

718
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,920
to do this and I you know i'd you can't
really offended somebody earlier today

719
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,530
that I knew because these guys that
you'll never find

720
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,210
I already have in fact don't want them
but I'm not telling you who it is cuz

721
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,190
you dumps Billy this week what are you
supposed to do when people tell you

722
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:15,560
nobody will help you know we will help
you like all the students here at like

723
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,950
I know it can be done yes a lot of no

724
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm hearing a lot no back in here

725
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,569
Obama and fresher and I think that the
person he said like you can't do it like

726
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:34,569
I for Sonos of the list of people who
could potentially mentor

727
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,200
even if you did manage to wear him down
are learning with peter

728
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,640
and should not do it but

729
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,379
yeah the men trying times work there's a
lot of great examples like

730
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,470
Tevion women and its its it's not even
like so much

731
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,569
I'm it's not like it's Damian town or
even hand-holding

732
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:59,000
it's just like now if I tried it doesn't
work the first time

733
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,650
who do I ask that's not gonna make me
feel like I'm more on

734
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,740
and sound that's like them primary
function

735
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,589
and is a little bit off topic kinda on
topic I have

736
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:14,170
%uh women and technology as Wisconsin

737
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,730
imposter syndrome like women tend to be
more prone to Lake

738
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:22,000
everyone outflank never fucked up it's
just me

739
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,480
like I magically got to this place at
the top

740
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,710
one day they're gonna find out at Lake I
just

741
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,270
learning a little bit at a time and got
here and which

742
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,800
is apparently its kind so I'm

743
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,270
yes it if you're feeling it's huge

744
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,869
an excuse a lot of people at especially
like you file a bug report now like

745
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:49,950
did you relay stipulation 947 about
filing a bug reports

746
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,270
some ecologists break %uh

747
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:57,119
re: nevermind on are found for a few
tries it again

748
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,430
so and yeah I think it is perseverance

749
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,560
finance people there are how far and
just kinda

750
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,700
stop bothering to discuss it with people

751
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,230
enter am you know I maybe

752
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,560
failing to send a car be a mentor

753
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,049
Sam naming %uh

754
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:25,050
okay thanks you guys

755
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:29,619
