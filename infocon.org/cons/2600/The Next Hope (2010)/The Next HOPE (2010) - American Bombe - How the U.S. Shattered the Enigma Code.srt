1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,799
now we are reaching the end

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,570
and it has happened sometime

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,230
and time is now we have one announcement
left that makes any sense to announce

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,029
that he is at five o'clock will have
lightning talks

5
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,660
here and vats

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,080
it's so we're gonna learn something
about enigma and the bomb

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,300
well hi everybody sorry for the delay
the

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,660
apparently bring three different
machines here %ah

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,920
isn't enough to compact cell Michael E
wanna guys over there helped us out with

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,020
7 box that actually was able to do all
this work

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,680
or least minutes sup on with the discs

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,210
poor the talk on this is called american
bomb how the US shattered the Enigma

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:49,690
code

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,730
the first thing understandable some few
disclaimers actually

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,660
first I'm not a historian I have an
interest in this stuff

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,829
if I E make a few mistakes on a date I
hope nobody

17
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,969
you know kills report I aside from that

18
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:09,030
the International Spy Museum rocks i'd
of a baker's been to it it is

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,070
one of the the museum itself is pretty
interesting

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,920
if you don't wanna go to the museum go
to the bookstore bookstore is one of the

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,799
most amazing places I governments and i
got so many

22
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,990
amazing box there and it's not even that
big so if you're in DC

23
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,619
if you have a chance international spy
museum is an amazing amazing place

24
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,290
cell like I said at the beginning its
American

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,750
bomb thats bomb not bomba most people
say Bama

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,259
I its its it can be a little bit
confusing

27
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,680
its actually want people who worked in
the US

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,790
on the US Naval neighbors in his
writings he

29
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,290
he wrote be OMB because he had never
seen its

30
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,520
right now before he was always referring
to adjust

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,030
in talks with people smear oh now for
the first time 0 be 0 MB

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,549
the good thing to keep in mind is that

33
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,130
enigmas and the method sets

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,640
the British and the US naval your the
crack in it they did

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,430
they were electromechanical attacks not
electronic

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,720
on the Enigma machine was of course
electromechanical and

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,810
and that is that it's important
distinction because we're

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,830
were kinda have at the 2010 the
electronic age

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,180
were a lot of stuff is a mixture of
electromechanical and electronic lock

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,319
Tom Campbell obviously

41
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,810
you have electrical contracting through
but you also have cures rotating in

42
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,430
order to move things forward. notes: not
purely electronic

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,670
so some terms related to

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,470
what we're discussing we have enigma
which is obviously the

45
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,000
actual machine that's doing the
encryption and decryption accident

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,610
machine was used for both not everybody
knows that alt rock which is the

47
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,780
name up the program that's that's what
the British refer to the program

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,849
that was their efforts to crack enigma
and that were added later with the

49
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:01,049
Americans also would prefer to defraud
an ass

50
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,379
and shark which is for Triton which is
the specifically the

51
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:10,250
naval cipher that the germans introduced
Ryan was the name that the germans gave

52
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,730
it and shark is what the British and the
Americans refer to it its

53
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,349
so

54
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:23,000
thats a lot of zeros that's actually ten
to one forty-fifth and

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,010
that is the number different possible
combinations and admission machine could

56
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,379
inside for peace text to

57
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,450
I was just to give you a little bit of
an idea on

58
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,659
in general what kind of a challenge
they're facing

59
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,780
when they were dealing with a neck
little bit more

60
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,830
history of the enigma I Nick but the
first models introduced in 1923

61
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,830
the Polish were the first to actually

62
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,390
I i get their hands on one and figure
out how it works

63
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,370
and eventually about five weeks before
the war started

64
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,939
they handed over all of their
information to

65
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,470
the British and the French I
interestingly also

66
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,980
the um the name bong comes from

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,519
the post photographer super working one

68
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,489
their own co breaking things I think
that they were they were first to crack

69
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,189
in it by

70
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,228
it the earlier versions of Magna I very

71
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,310
the the machines that they were building
to automate the process cracking its

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,370
I its little bit of a dispute depending
on who you ask

73
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,070
some people say it's the sound ticking
sound that the machine made and that is

74
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,389
why they called it a bomb

75
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,729
other people say that it's just candy
orange ice cream

76
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,270
that the poster photographers liked I
its

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,000
you now certainly like a like there's an
last talk nothing

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,490
nothing changes people people have weird
names to stop

79
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,910
I this here's the original patent

80
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,250
I this one smart 1920 eights

81
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,570
from what I've been able to see the the
first Inklings up the machine actually

82
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,250
is

83
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,780
in leaders 1913 bites

84
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,160
this is the actual patent that that was
on file

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,639
and yet so that's that's the enigma

86
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,070
cell how the Enigma machine works so
nice you guys know

87
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,820
how it works but just a little bit will
be back on this is a3 rotor and that but

88
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
not a forerunner in a gnite which

89
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,560
will discuss a little bit later but the
three-day tournament you can see

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,389
at the top you have those three little
dials with sup protruding

91
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,090
and directly underneath it you have the
I'm

92
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,500
at the light board like 40 is we're the
inside for tax or the decipher tax would

93
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,229
appear

94
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,289
and directly belief that you have the

95
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:38,409
on the keyboard we would actually type
in

96
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:45,410
the tax and at the bottom you have the
sector Border plug board

97
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:49,479
this is a box operators this is Sep

98
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,849
back to seven rotors later on in the war
they were eventually have a choice have

99
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,100
aids different rotors you could possibly
put in a machine I

100
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,560
it it made it much more difficult to

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,620
to crack because any one of these riders
could be in any I love

102
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,970
in the three returning by any of the
three positions which

103
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,919
manse thats you had 336 possible
combinations

104
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
is the 9 2010 sevens has become
something 6

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,490
such a good friend to 36 possible now we
all positions that you start with

106
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,060
on top of the rest here's a little bit
of a

107
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,340
cutaway you could see the way that the
individual rotors workers their contacts

108
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,440
on the side

109
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,940
the contacts once I for each letter to
another position so

110
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,520
on one rotor see would go to axe and
savell

111
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,099
not tax but it could see would go to be
and on the neck sweater it would go

112
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,880
you know from v2 to you were and we keep
going and keep coming

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,750
and so that's that's the way the rotors
work

114
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,190
then you have the plug for the plug word
actually wasn't in the earliest models

115
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,400
on the net via

116
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,860
you back to get exactly when it was
introduced but the plug board added

117
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,120
another level of complexity because you
could routes

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,250
this case ace rapid 20

119
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,759
and ass is routed to J but that

120
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,270
in the end zone actually cause some
problems now for the British for the

121
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,039
Americans but cause problems for the
germans because

122
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,068
while a is Stecker 20

123
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:20,099
a was also Stecker to a which reduces
the number of possible permutations

124
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,650
sup I the British got this information
from

125
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,360
from poland and city on 13 what war was
started

126
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,430
they had been working hard in add

127
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,550
don't actually been able to crack Annika

128
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,630
up as the war went on as the US was
drawn into the war

129
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,740
they realized that they were not going
to be in this alone

130
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,129
there needed to be cooperation
specifically

131
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:49,229
in 19 41 in the summer forty-one

132
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,280
there was a meeting between kinda the
head

133
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,150
code-breaking on both sides of the
Atlantic Agnes driscoll

134
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,509
was one of the top US Navy code breakers
she was

135
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,150
leading the US efforts to crack enigma
driscoll

136
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,780
relied mostly on old school methods she
believe that intuition would be the

137
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,539
solution to most things the

138
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,210
I help she relied heavily on generating
just great volumes

139
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,419
where people could lookup all of the
possible solutions

140
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,250
and that was really going to be the
efficient way to do things

141
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,599
she did not believe electro mechanical
automation

142
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,650
she just didn't think it was the way to
do things on the other hand Alistair

143
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,590
Dennistoun

144
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,289
was the head of Bletchley Park obviously
but to park %uh dates

145
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,130
tearing you that's where guy you that's
where electromechanical and eventually

146
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,950
electronic code breaking

147
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,419
really got its start he thoughts that's

148
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,519
rather than relying on code breakers who
were specifically

149
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,760
geared towards intuition or things like
that he believed in focusing on

150
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,689
mathematicians

151
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,000
young up-and-comers like touring and day
with

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,620
help automate the process and reduce the
time necessary

153
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,769
to crack all these codes so

154
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,850
I Agnes driscoll was working at OP
twenty-g_

155
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,850
open 20 GA to several acronym it sounds
for the officer chief of naval

156
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,180
operations 22 vision of the office of
naval communications

157
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,510
G section real simple

158
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:22,810
II OP twenty-g_ was US Navy script
analysis group during world war 2

159
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,810
its there that is we're everything was
going forward

160
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,910
bites having access to risk of the head
relief on

161
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,050
it got to a point where the they were
just hitting the wall

162
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,930
and already you know they said they had
met the enemy 2000 s10

163
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,100
where in the in the summer forty-one and
how to dance and was

164
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,350
offering the US a lot of information

165
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,740
abouts the Briscoe braking effort
specifically the bridge bombs that were

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,040
under construction but Agnes to school
didn't

167
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,660
wants anything to do with it so she
flat-out refuse the offer

168
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,209
so I but by the former 1941

169
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:04,250
it was clear that's you know she was
hitting wall she wasn't getting anywhere

170
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,250
perceptions about the way the networks
were just

171
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,070
you know they were right she was sending
requests to

172
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,339
to the British for more information on
the way to the the networks

173
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,959
and yoshi is getting a little bit but
really wasn't getting anywhere

174
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,029
are so in november I she actually

175
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,579
worse open to the idea of having a
meeting with three MIT students

176
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:29,950
OP twenty-g_ was you know kind of coming
into their own realizing that

177
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,700
this was a good work they needed to
approach their own code-breaking efforts

178
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,930
in terms of electromechanical or
electronic

179
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,510
code-breaking at November 3rd meeting at
the MIT students

180
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,880
met with Driscoll found out what was
going on. started going around to some

181
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,540
the other code breakers

182
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,699
and if they started asking a simple
question I love

183
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,670
what can we do to automate your process
on

184
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,899
and interestingly the the MIT students
those three

185
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,459
became somebody had code breakers at the
m section

186
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,480
opet OP twenty-g_ and

187
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,260
you know remained there throughout the
war

188
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,610
so at Verve reason that Aniston had been
so willing

189
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,750
to share secrets with the Americans when
he came in the summer 41

190
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,610
was because they that the British were
concerned that eventually become

191
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,279
that the americans would come to the
realization that they needed

192
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,740
to conduct their operations differently
and

193
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,980
they would start their car breaking
program up their own the

194
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,579
electrical/electronic could record from
their own and build their own bombs

195
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,269
and England did not want them to enact
they

196
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,079
really were concerns that the americans
with talk

197
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,519
VIII I mean I guess I was naive I didn't
know that that was a your

198
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,019
a stereotype americans especially during
that time

199
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:53,600
I its a the more I look at propaganda
posters

200
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,730
which by the way are amazing the artwork
a propaganda posters you can find online

201
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,519
is just awesome on but you know there's
there's plenty propaganda

202
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,700
about keeping your mouth shut and sad
its it was a real concern for the

203
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,279
British

204
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,649
and that is that's why they were willing
to give some information they felt that

205
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:12,779
if the

206
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,120
clue the American since what they were
doing the Americans went right start

207
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,290
their own program

208
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,870
they would say okay you guys got it
covered you know what whenever we

209
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,120
you know whenever we pick up on our
boats will send to you whenever you get

210
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,540
your send it to us everything will be
fine everything we Peachy Keen

211
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,069
I'm obviously wants america really
started getting into war that wasn't

212
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,700
going to be an option

213
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,940
but for some reason they felt like that
was the

214
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,630
was the best approach and ironically
after the war

215
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,529
the information that was leaked about
you know what was going on

216
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:49,279
he entered the code breaking up in Etna
the Americans want one sweet anything

217
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,380
it was the British all the information
that you can find on the american

218
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,439
code-breaking efforts specifically
related to enigma it was

219
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,480
all declassified after 2001 II

220
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,670
so there's there's really not that much
out there our

221
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,389
bites he there was a book published in
the seventies called the altar secret

222
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,990
and it was actually some a friend who
was

223
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,290
who was the one who broke the silence
first cell were

224
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,370
I guess again a for effort but enough
for carry through

225
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,260
I'm Sep moving on

226
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,220
once the 120 P twenty-g_ had decided
that they were going to move forward

227
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,180
with their own

228
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,519
bomb program of their own they needed a
place to design and build these

229
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,839
that place was NCR the National Cash
Register Company

230
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,389
has anybody hear her defense ER okay
some people now can see our

231
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:43,220
and CR not exactly the first place you
would think up most people would say oh

232
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,760
it's

233
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,560
you know early computing days IBM and CR

234
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,360
II its he was actually founded well
before I be unfounded in

235
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,399
1884 they really were an industry leader
and were top align

236
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,320
at that time by 1906 they already had a
cash register that was powered by an

237
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,639
electric motor

238
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,060
and they employ Thomas J Watson who
after dispute left

239
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,440
and when I want to reform IBM and
foreign culture and IBM specifically

240
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,170
sir right at a time when he joined them
it was cops have emissions company

241
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,779
but the he was one was responsible for
change a name for it I DM

242
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,760
and NCR was a major player they're still
around today

243
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,329
you can find the ATM's all over the
place you can find

244
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:32,930
cash registers sometimes I'm

245
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,070
and at NCR during that time

246
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,769
the US Naval computing machine
laboratory was established

247
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,089
US Naval computing machine laboratory
was

248
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,260
I guess the equivalent to pledge we park

249
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,760
in america I'm and that is where

250
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,269
I'm like I think intellectually Park if
it was mostly focused on the ideas and

251
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,399
not so much

252
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,190
the building up the machine but at the
US Naval computer machine laboratory in

253
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,170
NCR

254
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,880
that is where they both designs and
built the machines

255
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,920
and national caches company was located
in Dayton Ohio

256
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,709
and so that is where all of the

257
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:16,250
all the stuff to place the man who works
for an CRM was chosen

258
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,540
to had up this this project

259
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,079
was Joseph dash Joseph dash

260
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:27,570
I he was he was employees have NCR

261
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,769
and he

262
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,240
but see his

263
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,610
he was brought in mostly because they
initially started

264
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,690
with the people from the and section
people like the three MIT students they

265
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:40,949
had

266
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:44,070
brought into first talkative like I can
stress cool

267
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,089
and they were focused one developing the
process

268
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:51,980
but if they were not able to actually
produce machines the

269
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,259
their designs were not able to be
implemented in a timely fashion

270
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,370
so when they needed someone who had a
history

271
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,120
actually you know designing and building
machines

272
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,360
they want to just dash I he was he was
pioneering and designing

273
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,370
Abascal signature tubes I use for
counting and tracking

274
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,649
he he had actually been MIT to creation
of electronic

275
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,160
a fully electronic digital calculator in
nineteen forty

276
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,490
I'm it was I believe the size of dinner
room but

277
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,730
it was the first electronic digital
calculator and

278
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,790
he was use the first wanted to get there

279
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,029
so they felt that you know the guys in
am section with design it

280
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,500
and he will be responsible for not
cracking designs for finding them

281
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,000
and actually getting it built I'm so

282
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,070
the the way that's England at the time
had been

283
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,420
had to carry out the code-breaking
efforts relied heavily on three thinks

284
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,509
at the three things were the actual
nigga rotors

285
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,860
code box and Crips

286
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,490
I did endeavor wheels obviously pretty
obvious Co books also pretty simple

287
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,759
both those were captured from U-boats
usually and sometimes in the pockets

288
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,530
outside nig operators

289
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,949
be the first to enable rotors that were
captured I have thrown the Enigma

290
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:09,959
machine overboard

291
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,089
but he had forgotten that he had two
rotors in his pocket when they captured

292
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,809
and they got two runs from that

293
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,859
on & Co talks were also pretty hard to
come by the response to dispose of them

294
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,559
and are actually waited with lead said
they would sink to the bottom of the

295
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,490
ocean

296
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,730
when they ago as soon as they threw him
over and the crips

297
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,340
little bit different obviously not an
actual crab I if they were

298
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,909
hour drive from common Jersey come turn
phrases

299
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,289
obviously the cryptic messages or just
lazy and im operators

300
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:42,160
you had people you know ending things in
a certain way with Scott particular sign

301
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,730
of

302
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,950
you know that you could use as a crib to
test against if you had

303
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,440
all sorts of stuff like that just lazy
lazy people

304
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,549
who or people who didn't understand you
know what was going on there

305
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm the Americans wanted to move away
from a reliance

306
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,710
exclusively on these things and they
wanted to produce some were

307
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,390
just a foolproof force attack and and
create a machine that could do that

308
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,299
and they wanted their machines to really
take a quantum leap forward

309
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,629
from where the British had been they if
they are initially wanted the machines

310
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,120
to be fully electronic

311
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,750
not electromechanical has probably a
large reason why they chose dash because

312
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,429
it had

313
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,620
his successes with electronic and what a
mechanical but

314
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,289
but more successful electronic machines
and

315
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,840
they also wanted their machines to be
able to tackle both

316
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,178
the four rotor Enigma codes and the
three rotor Enigma codes

317
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,530
something that the British machines were
not able to do

318
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,629
England actually started constructing
for rhetoric Nick Myers they were never

319
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,890
really reliable

320
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:50,100
and I think they never fully got them
into it to full production run because

321
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,640
up the american efforts

322
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,220
so free labor to win well what does that
mean

323
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,720
Joseph dash work some thirteen other
projects it became

324
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,049
pretty obvious this was going to be the
most difficult one

325
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,418
there was a budget of about two million
dollars for this

326
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,039
for this project but what the US Navy
was asking for

327
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,490
was well over 100 times faster that
anything that had previously created

328
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,350
I the British were produced machines
that were able to crack an egg Mar

329
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,640
but because they weren't that fast
that's why they had to rely

330
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,630
on the things I spoke about earlier on
the

331
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,630
he realized pretty quickly though that
in order to construct a machine at least

332
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,390
with the design that he was trying for

333
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,710
to make it fully electronic in they
would need

334
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,880
almost 20,000 to use in order to get it
to work

335
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,640
hand twenty thousand tubes they had no
power supplies occurred

336
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,559
supply enough power for that the heat
would make them

337
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,220
completely unreliable there was just no
way

338
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,480
to get back to work so they were pretty
much

339
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,049
up the creek about points bites the

340
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,789
the people superiors to Josh at OP
twenty-g_

341
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:08,440
weren't happy but they knew that he
wasn't exaggerating cell they said

342
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,720
okay that doesn't work give us a
solution

343
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,309
and its it's also at that point that day

344
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,730
kind of realized well if you can't just
constructed based on what's out there

345
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,640
now

346
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,830
they out we're gonna have to give you
more information about a contest was

347
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,158
just going to just going to build this
they said we need a machine that does

348
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,820
axe at that point he was acted runs a
full so to the inner circle

349
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,280
I guess and if they gave him much more
information

350
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,629
one how actually been in the works and
the fall Co breaking efforts he

351
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,850
he wasn't really up until that point
skillfully in there

352
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,309
on dash at

353
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,710
after he was brought in he came up with
a solution

354
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,650
to do to make an electromechanical

355
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,820
bomb and now just like this

356
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,178
sorry good um if

357
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:02,120
it surprisingly there's a lot of great
art but there's also surprising amount

358
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,490
of

359
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,690
really racist art so you get you gotta
be careful what you pick sometimes have

360
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,539
the stuff

361
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,940
um yeah but at dishes

362
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,080
approach that was electromechanical was
a purely electromechanical

363
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,240
what he was proposing to do was kinda
merge

364
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,299
I love the commutator wheels that were
used on the British bombs

365
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:27,080
to simulate individual need marauders
and takers advances in high-speed

366
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,350
a electronics and the tubes to record

367
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,690
hands playback and information I

368
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,220
he a the they specifically would track
the part that the hits

369
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,590
that the bomb would make and then rewind
to the points

370
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,699
and that sped up operations considerably

371
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,780
because previously with the British
palms it just kind of got past that we

372
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,668
had to

373
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:54,230
the circle contest we had to kinda
realize we're

374
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,230
it had not made the connection and then
go back in said it backs up going to

375
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,010
keep going and try for another

376
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,230
another possible solution I'm so

377
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,140
again this was this was not going to be
any small engineering feat

378
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,480
but it was very necessary in order to
approach

379
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,640
even close to disputes that the US Navy
was asking for

380
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,760
I'm despite the fact that he was able to
get you know that his

381
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,169
at least he thought at the time is able
to to get close to

382
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:25,210
what they were initially asking for I
she

383
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,169
estimated that if they were going to be
336 bombs

384
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,799
in order to reliably crack an egg

385
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,010
in order to crack get the three wheel
they're going to need

386
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,510
336 because they were gonna use one
machine sex check

387
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,408
each possible rotor configuration on the

388
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:49,230
its insane amounts at that point
actually the

389
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,760
the revised estimate up the man's gonna
cost was about four million

390
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,890
so they within the course of a few
months there jumped

391
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,590
you know from two to four million are
still I guess the US was desperate

392
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,000
because they said you know

393
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,070
whatever were all in just go for it

394
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,870
I'm bag you know every day that they
didn't

395
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,090
they weren't able to effectively read
Georgia Communications

396
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,850
more both for being lost and every time
they would sink a German bowed

397
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,530
they've where you know the germans would
build them fast and they could say Come

398
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,350
cell

399
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,830
they were you know they were kind of
Candlemas to track

400
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,309
cell I'm dash himself though

401
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:29,830
while he was brought into the inner
circle I he

402
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,059
wasn't allowed to use the words Bahmani
Carnaval

403
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:37,110
computing machine laboratory with and
people's working with

404
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,470
and he was under extra scrutiny himself
a guy from Sweden Bruce meter

405
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,669
she was living and ashes house I dash
had like iight

406
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:48,720
two-room hunter something something that
he built

407
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,029
in Dayton and up Bruce meter was
actually living in the house with him

408
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:57,559
I the reason for that was although they
you know we've gone through all those

409
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,389
clearances and everything else

410
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,820
I apparently his mother had immigrated

411
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,689
from Germany to England's and then from
England to America at the age of 13

412
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,730
so they figured he might still have a
connection because of that

413
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,860
cannot be trusted and even though they
were trusting about things

414
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,500
at the same time cannot be trusted and
top fact it turns out that dash had a

415
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,539
second cousin

416
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:24,250
who also lived in Dayton at the time and
their father

417
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:28,440
actually was still in germany cell there
was somewhat of a connection to guess a

418
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,490
little bit more

419
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,980
reasonable why they had their concerns
but

420
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,630
you know they they they were not taking
any chances with them

421
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,010
one of the one of the interesting things
is that the relationship between meter

422
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,279
and dash

423
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,039
was always trades and meter since he was
living in his house

424
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,700
was one who will be twenty-g_ called on
specifically

425
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,539
to give pressure to dash and she was
there day and night to being

426
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,669
you know just putting pressure on him
and

427
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:01,110
itself reading the books thats you know
the guilt trips he laid on dash

428
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,650
were just eventually they they broke
dash

429
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,250
possibly due to his developed Catholic
upbringing

430
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,230
before the guilt that they were giving
him not my words it's now

431
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,380
actually believe in one of these books
have

432
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,470
despite the pro Picasa pressure for
maybe specifically because of its

433
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,610
progress was initially rather slow it
was clear that although they had

434
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,100
initially set

435
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,309
a delivery date of the early months in
nineteen forty-three

436
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:31,908
that was not going to be mapped guy

437
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:35,210
its it just was not a realistic time

438
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,380
so in December love

439
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,620
40s 42 man came to town

440
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,970
that's alan Turing's and I defy anybody
to find a a picture

441
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:49,010
about entering other than that where he
smiled and cars obviously fake

442
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,039
player mister turn comes City sup

443
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:55,360
in the summer forty-two not to ring
actually

444
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,900
arm he arrived at least Washington DC
for

445
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,289
visits to see what was going on here and
to possibly

446
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:07,330
help out and its there's not so much
information because

447
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,620
the fact that one of the ones cut code
breakers was visiting america

448
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,020
was a closely guarded secret not that
many records everything that was going

449
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,010
on

450
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,120
hands its also from what I've read it's
possibly

451
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,549
apostle he wouldn't have even come if
the four rotor in eight mos

452
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:28,010
for our bombs thats in with his truck at
the time had been close to completion

453
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,760
this was simply because they were not so
close to completion they want to see

454
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,179
what America was up to you know maybe
babies crazy and he's actually have come

455
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,529
up with something

456
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,850
I was computer was becoming clear to
both sides

457
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,460
that dash and his team we're going to
have the greatest chance for success

458
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,460
I'm turning actually sent a memo back

459
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,260
after spending time in NCR and also
apparently slept one just as Florida's

460
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,309
small to cap a hot because in Dayton
Ohio

461
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:01,379
apparently if if you were lucky you got
a spot on the floor in the hallway

462
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,990
up for the hotel and if you were really
like you got a spot on the floor in

463
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,570
someone's house

464
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:11,230
I am interns memo it's a bit of a mixed
bag

465
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,270
he clearly has respect fourth dash and
what he's doing

466
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,820
I he's impressed with a lot of the
engineering worked out especially given

467
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,750
the fact

468
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,850
that dash wasn't given a lot of the
information

469
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,370
about what was going on in England's
outlet to park was doing their stuff

470
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,289
Dennistoun came over

471
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,049
offer the stuff to Driscoll with just
over fused didn't have the south and

472
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:32,639
then

473
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,799
by the time Driscoll was maybe opener
the other people it'll be twenty were

474
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:36,770
open to

475
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,059
getting this information Dennison was
gone he had been

476
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,360
promoted out of where he was and so
they'd foreign

477
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,270
didn't have as much access to
information so they were coming up with

478
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,100
a lot of the stuff on their own

479
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,710
and just getting kinda basic ideas of
the way the networked

480
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,360
arm so turn was impressed with how far
they've been able to come

481
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,570
without all the previous work that

482
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,600
people had done in England's but he also
we are and about some

483
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,299
assumptions that does have made that
trying to personally

484
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:11,950
were not necessarily true I dash was
planning on using commutator reels

485
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,950
like the British and he was going to use

486
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,320
wire brushes to maintain contact with
you to the points he's the 26 points

487
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,899
one each the commutator wheels touring
experience that after they

488
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:28,390
they're tested in a lab in england when
they finally produce the bombs

489
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,700
what would happen disaster word russia's
would come into contact with

490
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,230
one contact points it would cut center
up into the air beds

491
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,840
and would sometimes balance they get
prospects is what they called it

492
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
and about over the next contact and data

493
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,630
miss miss causal connection for create
false connection somewhere

494
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,980
he also had reservations specifically
about dashes use

495
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,760
up different size commentator wheels in
his first prototype any

496
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,299
strongly urge him to move to one single
type wheels

497
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,600
obvious if you have one type wheel that
you're replacing cuz we also need be

498
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,399
switched out

499
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,210
for different Fig rations it's a lot
easier to manage

500
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,230
over the course of time

501
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,649
sell the first a the first models the
first prototype scandal I'm

502
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:18,049
were adamantly Adam n Eve

503
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,110
I they were completed in february of
nineteen forty-three

504
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,600
and the actually actually did work

505
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,559
by its they were prone to all sorts of
oil leaks and would break down after

506
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,379
just a few minutes

507
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,820
operation out despite this because they
actually had working prototypes were

508
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,960
because they were absolutely desperate

509
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,659
the Navy pressed on with the project and
was still or asking for the full

510
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:43,960
order of 336 pops

511
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,130
they felt that you know even if these
machines were going to be fast enough

512
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,100
that they weren't going to be the for
336 bombs

513
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,539
and they ended up on anything about a
third have that amount

514
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,950
the might if the germans decided to
change

515
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,960
inimical drive update shark or to change
in a bit they would need to

516
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,080
on and the need to test all the possible

517
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,580
combinations and sell it with just you
know they need the full order

518
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,279
so while they were constructing Adam and
Eve and as

519
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,460
you know has are constructing later
models as well an interesting problem

520
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,390
came up

521
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,120
the problem was the number 26 was
everywhere

522
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,010
the number 26 obviously 26 letters so
when you're dealing with stuff for your

523
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,250
encryption and decryption letters

524
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,549
if you're um if you're sending anything
out

525
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:36,279
to manufacturers because although was
suppose to be constructed all in Dayton

526
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:39,159
there were some things that they just
didn't have the capacity to do they had

527
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,350
to send out

528
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,649
some other parts the wiring and other
things

529
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:46,779
to outside manufacturers so

530
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:51,169
they need to hide the number 26 they did
a couple different way some things were

531
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:51,990
simple

532
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,570
I when he would order wires they would
they won a different color for each one

533
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,309
state order 28 wires instead 26 wires

534
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:02,510
in 26 different colors I'm that they
would also do things out

535
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,029
one thing which would be so clever for
this crowd but in some other girls would

536
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:06,539
work

537
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:10,210
the numbered everything from 00 to 25

538
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,169
25 a little bit more of a round number
so okay it's just you now

539
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:18,149
just turn into whatever it is not not
something out of the ordinary

540
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:21,870
am yeah they they actually sometimes

541
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,529
the attempt to hide the number 26 or
some of the other

542
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:28,919
things that they were due to conceal
exactly what they're doing

543
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,159
word would be to forty or so excluding
people in separate rooms in these

544
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,450
buildings

545
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,340
you know let's say you could lead to
people just you know doing the one thing

546
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,140
all day every day for two years some
them you know with

547
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,880
go little bit stir crazy from its
there's a there's a joke someone said

548
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,269
that saddam

549
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:51,070
some was sitting in a room and you know
they're drilling a hole from one room to

550
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,289
the other it's just to get power to the
next room

551
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,330
and somebody said oh you know where's
your where's your bash you running wires

552
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:56,939
here was

553
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,850
9022 bastard just no looking through the
wormhole

554
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,980
harm so you know they

555
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,309
they made every effort to disguise what
they were doing

556
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:10,480
and a you know they kept on pushing
forward

557
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,049
and then finally online May 26

558
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,260
I'm sorry May 28 1943 technician by the
name of

559
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,710
feel like bulky geo was running a test
on

560
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,429
Adam first the two prototypes obviously
and all of a sudden machine stopped

561
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:27,740
working

562
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,380
he had been working on this machine for
quite a while obvious at this point

563
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,549
and the assumed it was just another one
of the electrical shorts or something is

564
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:35,610
going on

565
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,630
up but then like magic or Poseidon the
machine

566
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,210
just you know kind of buzz back to life

567
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,919
and it started to rewind and that was
actually the first

568
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,289
hit that they got and the first time
that they had used

569
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:54,419
one of the american-built machines with
america palms to actually crack

570
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:59,429
an enigma cipher on its after he ate you
know he verified I think Iran it again

571
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:00,830
it came up in the same points

572
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,100
he took it over to a technician in like
another area golf

573
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,360
probably three blocks away or something
I was operating Eve the other

574
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
prototyping ran on it

575
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,960
same thing happens sent off to
washington said you know

576
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,700
everything's you know we got a success
turned out at the time that

577
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,710
the British had cracked a difficult week
or two earlier that that specific one

578
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,360
out but the point was they were actually
able to

579
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,700
to figure out what was going on and the
word you know they were being successful

580
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,029
things were finally working

581
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,440
up but things were

582
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,620
not going as well as people would have
hoped during the war

583
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,049
how it was it was young summer 1943
things were starting to turn

584
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:44,350
but it wasn't set in stone that's you
know way

585
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,390
that's that the allied forces were going
to win the war germs were still doing

586
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,490
brutal damage to freighters all over the
Atlantic

587
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,340
on the shipping lanes ands it actually
turned out

588
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,649
that the Germans had been reading the
cryptic messages

589
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:02,850
ass is a good one scripted with site for
number three from the British

590
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,429
hi about two years are earlier in 1941

591
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:09,550
the Americans had hearings the British
abouts

592
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,359
the fact that the terms were probably
cracker comes because

593
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,449
how the German seem to have intelligence
that could not have come from any other

594
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,868
source

595
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:22,329
I'm it its also interesting to note
thats

596
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:25,659
England should've learn from Germany's
mistakes because

597
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,879
Germany specifically didn't make that
many changes

598
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,509
to the Enigma code because they were so
confident that it was impossible to be

599
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,740
cracked

600
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,000
they make changes and they they had lots
of different versions bites you know

601
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,879
they they had

602
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,139
other ciphers and other options that
they could have moved to had the fort

603
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,349
that he was reliably been cracked but
they were just they'd had no

604
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:51,200
they thought was absolutely no way
possible that the British were cracking

605
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,589
at

606
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,009
and it's certainly fair crack again was
not gonna be with

607
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,450
you know any sort of liability in any
sort of regularity

608
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,660
cell after that point once the

609
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,990
once they found out that's the Germans
were cracking cipher number three

610
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,640
seems pretty much since they started
introducing it so they probably had some

611
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,640
some advanced larger someone on the
inside who was getting a lot of

612
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,259
information

613
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,540
they switch over to cipher number five

614
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,170
ans once they switched over to cipher
number five they were actually the

615
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,690
join you both were never able to get
above about a quarter up the sinkings

616
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,680
that they had previously had

617
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,740
earlier in the war hot so

618
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,800
at this point the Adam n Eve

619
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,630
were operating and you know they were
starting to gear up operations

620
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,010
for producing the fall run American
bombs

621
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,310
and I dash was kinda feel good things
are things work in your car finance

622
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,680
process everything's

623
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,210
gonna work but US Navy came back and
said well you had the small-scale

624
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,740
successes that's great

625
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,910
now since you got back to work go to a
fully electronic lock

626
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,279
how he was just

627
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,560
pissed he you know he he

628
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,980
he'd been working he said to them a
million times it's just not

629
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,540
possible its you know if its

630
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,540
it's also he had to explain to them I
guess that

631
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,130
he wasn't opposed electronics he had
built you know is what run a calculator

632
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,310
he was cute saw that this was the future

633
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,529
by when you're trying to do something in
the middle of a war you're not looking

634
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,609
for

635
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:30,150
you know the thing that's going to be
the absolute best you kinda needed to be

636
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,410
the best that you can get right now so

637
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,690
your after some begging pleading and
probably the thing that really turns out

638
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,250
he

639
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,770
mentioned that he was gonna put strain
won the you know the resources that were

640
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,940
you know that they've had very little up
during the war specifically

641
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,200
and thus up if you need for your
building all the tubes

642
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,570
I and just the ridiculousness are you
know how hard it would get and that

643
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,710
while at optimal efficiency would work
as well as they wanted

644
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,310
it probably was not going to actually
get there they finally relented

645
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,680
and they let him continue with what he
had previously

646
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,430
try to do that merge of
electromechanical and electronic bombs

647
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,868
and this is what the final a US bomb
actually look like

648
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:15,079
how you could see on the front you have
the

649
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,510
the 32 commentator wheels

650
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,040
and its this was just a massive piece
machine if it was about

651
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,359
seven feet wide and

652
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:29,848
at as like you know the bed of a truck
but

653
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:33,980
you now seven also like six or seven
feet high it's just a massive massive

654
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,300
machine

655
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,800
arm and by like july already

656
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,810
a 1943 15 American bombs had been
produced

657
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,109
but they're also played with some with
some problems that had kinda mystified

658
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:50,069
ask these were the final models not the

659
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:54,530
early production models I'm the bombs
plagued with full stops

660
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,980
I was kinda obvious that they were
experiencing brush mounts

661
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:01,050
and you know the kind of the couldn't
get them to work

662
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,760
they were frayed obviously at the time
that the but they're but will be cotton

663
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,849
everything will be for not sell you know
late one night dash

664
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,430
kind of was examining each and every you
know little piece of the

665
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,540
15 operational bonds that they had and
he found

666
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,980
thats the surfaces up a commentator
wheels

667
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,359
were actually not perfectly smooth they
added you don't enter found to be

668
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:23,220
perfectly smooth

669
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,270
to help eliminate issues a brush bounce
but they weren't

670
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:30,000
so they gather everybody they possibly
could stop them in a room gives you some

671
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,210
sandpaper

672
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,680
and they send them down a man of
accidents am paper might have been

673
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,930
some steel wool or something but the
point is they actually send them down

674
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,210
and that works that works for a while up
by its

675
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,270
after I've been working for a while they
ran into another problem now that they

676
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,650
have sent down the wheels

677
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,079
little slivers up for copper that were
created by the same thing

678
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,180
we're getting in between the points
different points on the on the

679
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,210
commentator wheels

680
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,280
ever shorting out some contacts so

681
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,200
at they introduced kind of just some
ideas

682
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,079
getting everybody to clean of the wheels
all the time

683
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,599
and want to introduce that they were
able to get these operating efficiently

684
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,920
ans getting out the door so

685
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,490
they got the move in by your Sept 43

686
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,960
the for shipments have bombs began to
leave dayton and make their way to

687
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,310
Washington

688
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,710
they were located in Washington DC for
the remainder of the war

689
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,310
other operated by the waves which were
women who volunteered

690
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,660
specifically first not solely for this
task but

691
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,470
I'll female volunteers who Rob bringing
these things actually 24 hours a day

692
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,480
seven days a week

693
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,640
um by December a forty-three not too
long afterwards

694
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,089
it decryption wasn't just the occasional
thing it wasn't

695
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,480
that their crack in one week it wasn't
that they're cracking in a few days

696
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,570
by December forty-three they were able
to crack the codes within

697
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:01,430
18 hours and that's that's really a an
important milestone because that meant

698
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,210
that messages could be read on the same
day that they were being sense

699
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,359
once you do with the settings were for
the day you got later messages for the

700
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:09,930
day and were able to actually

701
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,220
read the messages and respond on that
same day sometimes even before the

702
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,920
Germans were beating them themselves

703
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,109
I'm but once again i guess im

704
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:25,339
hurry up it here I'm once again it the

705
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:30,109
at all was not perfect in and lands of
the palm

706
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:34,500
I the they're being turned out and read
a six-week and heading out to washington

707
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,670
but I they there was a traitor in their
midst

708
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,240
ir or at least they thought there was a
traitor in their midst

709
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,730
I are one day there was optical
technician

710
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,369
at National Cash Register who was
getting right home for front-office

711
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:50,980
another guy work they're called

712
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,990
guy named James Montgomery junior you
said technician NCR it started working

713
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,780
there are a couple years beforehand

714
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,940
and he had given his keys to his
carter's other guy to

715
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,690
get an insight on gonna go get my wife
all me your car in a few minutes

716
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,339
guy one smoke cigarettes are looking
through the glove compartment

717
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,349
for some matches or something

718
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:14,760
and out feller buncher letters from
foreign embassies

719
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,180
and he said well this is interesting

720
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,129
up run-up to superiors axe a at

721
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,670
at NCR at the specifically the the group
Ansar was working

722
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,560
one bombs and would end up actually
happening with this guy

723
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,650
is he was held for the remainder of the
war there's

724
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,930
there's this whole thing I could go into
this guy James Montgomery junior

725
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,180
James Martin I can return your on enough
South he was

726
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,868
I think the CIA started lying to the
courts and prisons because they

727
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,119
newt said he was a civilian they
couldn't prosecute him

728
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,579
II you know what the in a military
tribunal or something so they

729
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:54,690
have crossed given the courts but their
time that the subs classified

730
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,880
but the I'm they're telling them you
know one day they tell them that it was

731
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,280
our

732
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,690
radar equipment that he's the only store
piece up next day they tell them that

733
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,940
you know he stole some some to from
somewhere

734
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,170
and they kept on giving conflicting
things trying to

735
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,690
give them a reason to imprison him and
keep him in prison for the rest the war

736
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:18,839
while not revealing what they were
actually doing

737
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:22,790
so some numbers other it all up to 120

738
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,630
American bombs that were produced and
220

739
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,500
British palms Americans as dash

740
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,660
specifically had designed his bomb to be
flexible

741
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,670
and I was one of the great advantages up
the american pop

742
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,829
it was designed to tattoo both the three
rotor and the four rotor enigma cuts

743
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:44,520
with the flick of a single switch they
could switch from three to four road

744
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,800
again the automation is really whites a
what made this

745
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,160
way way better then the British bombs
they were able to switch back and forth

746
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,089
and the machines were so efficient thats
it was a later time

747
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:59,759
during the war they were able to go
ahead and

748
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,150
during their downtime start cracking if
the

749
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,599
British earth different codes that the
British were responsible for cracking

750
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,790
so you know they were

751
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,910
really way way more you know

752
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,859
we're not impressive the then when you
think you know given given their

753
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:18,869
successes earlier on in the war

754
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:22,500
and you know said they'd be produced
helluva machine

755
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,170
the first guy Phil pitcher who who first
saw the thing at that was actually

756
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,089
think they have it written down but
that's what he said no machine stops he

757
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:31,630
thinks are crap something's wrong

758
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,990
machinery wines was like wow that's a
helluva miss you

759
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,160
I am some skip ahead a bit arm

760
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,540
so keeping secrets

761
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,250
like I said earlier I the British
actually were the first to

762
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,359
reveal secrets about the altar program
and

763
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,299
Americans never did dash himself

764
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,550
never talked actually his daughter
Debbie Anderson who was born a few years

765
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,960
after the war

766
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,740
I she had no clue what was going on she
knew that she that her

767
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,230
father had been working at a National
Cash Register Company he knew that

768
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,660
she knew that there was something to do
with the war she never had any clue

769
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,390
she she found out actually almost
accidentally

770
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,240
years later when there was a on display

771
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,599
going on it's some museum on the other
side the country from where she was

772
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,930
and dimensions that okay

773
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,220
and mentions thats the dimension the

774
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,819
that there were these contributions that
were built at National Cash Register

775
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:33,859
Company

776
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:37,640
during the war and shit really National
Cash Register Company during the war

777
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,310
that's weird my father was doing
something how big

778
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,640
actually after her father died she found
some papers on his

779
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,720
task that were on from the smithsonian
an interview that he did in the

780
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,040
mid-seventies

781
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,849
there was some basic stuff on there
saying yeah I was working on something

782
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:56,710
but the second he would talk about
anything related to Qatada fee was all

783
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,180
blacked out

784
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,569
I'm so apparently even the smithsonian
well after this point was in

785
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:06,140
wasn't you know high up enough to to get
the basic information

786
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,848
she actually called up the NSA after she
found those papers and said hey

787
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:13,000
I've got the school staff and would you
like to see it

788
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,380
and she showed up at the door and was
led into some strange rumors she was

789
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,790
capped for several hours

790
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,210
what people walked in silently picked up
papers laughed and said wow

791
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,510
and that would walk out and come back
with five other people would all go out

792
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,869
and not say anything come back

793
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:30,759
amish its it you know

794
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:34,719
likely though all other stuff was
declassified in 2001

795
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,029
are so you know there's their their
books there's a fantastic book

796
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:42,450
called the secret building 26 I

797
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,779
this goes through almost everything
related to

798
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:49,619
to what's happening in Dayton and a lot
more at a great book

799
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,229
bought it at the International Spy
Museum him and

800
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:56,989
I you know its it's really the book has
the most most of the other

801
00:45:56,989 --> 00:46:01,430
books you'll find they they talk about
what was going on

802
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,190
in America at the time but it's only a
liner to there's

803
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,450
you know there's a lot of information
that just wasn't available

804
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,019
so when they put out a later addition of
the box they include a little bit

805
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:16,259
but not that much I and classiest

806
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:19,969
there's a lot of stuff but still
classified in 2001 they

807
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:24,650
their release love the stuff bites no
once still sure what happens

808
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,700
after the war I building 26 at National
Cash Register Company in Dayton Ohio

809
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,420
is where all the stuff 101 it was still
operating after the war

810
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,849
arm its pretty pretty sure that the
bombs were being used during the Cold

811
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:38,390
War

812
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:42,328
to crack codes and that specifically why
there was such an effort to keep all the

813
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:43,390
stuff classified

814
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,029
because they were you know they they
forget that some the same codes you know

815
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:47,920
the germans weren't

816
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,130
really aware that the number was being
read so it's possible

817
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:54,309
somebody else was using was using the
same

818
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:58,630
same cutting techniques after the war
South American country specifically

819
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:02,390
ok so yes South American countries were
possibly were where they actually using

820
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,229
it was just a

821
00:47:03,229 --> 00:47:06,960
are they okay south-south maccabees were
actually using it so

822
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,170
and what happened to the bombs not so
clear

823
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,460
there are a couple that are museums I
think two or three I

824
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,869
most them are probably buried underneath
the you know cement somewhere near

825
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:17,799
building 26

826
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:22,940
when the river nearby on building 26
actually was

827
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,089
are destroyed in 2007 IEEE put up a
plaque

828
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:30,700
talking about what happened in 2001
after being with the classified

829
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,059
and in 2007 whole building and
everything was leveled to make way for

830
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,369
some shopping mall or something

831
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:38,999
which I don't leave has been built yet
but the but but it's got the governor

832
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:40,400
history cell everything's fine

833
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,319
%ah cell

834
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,989
