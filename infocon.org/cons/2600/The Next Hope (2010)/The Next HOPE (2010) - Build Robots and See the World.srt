1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,790
ed up by are Johannes from monochrome
cuz he has is awesome thing called

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,529
robo exotica which is the International
Festival

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,110
love cocktail robotics okay so arm

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,129
chassis arm our house kinda more

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,990
unusual capability right that is chassis
he rolls around on he's got stuff

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,210
on and he's kinda fully equipped right
arm

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,380
are cuz he is in fact 8 beverage
delivery device

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,519
right okay so he is essentially a mobile
k greater

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,899
right so finely I'm robot that does
something useful

10
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,770
okay so we took chassis to

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,120
all for two parties on we ship them
around or something com

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,280
a we can a serve all kinds of liquids
from

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,340
inside his are his case we have a corny
k we pressurize with arm

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,399
a co2 for beer we can use nitrogen serve
wine mmm

15
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,480
just pressurize with harry wants your
laminator just about anything

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,469
on and just is completely controlled by
remote control

17
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,309
on this actually very little
intelligence and chassis which is

18
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:05,970
alright

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,020
I'm so there he is on he is willing to
serve you

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,810
on the I we also put a-arm AR intercom
and Cassie's head so we can have like a

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,259
little man behind the curtain who can
kinda hide behind the

22
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,049
column and a dispersants uRS is Cassie's
personality

23
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,210
it's funny when you give the person the
microphone arm to control chassis and I

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,780
think Johannes can testify to this that
their personality changes in will

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,170
because

26
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,030
chance he's actually come with marcia
still kinda run into you and maybe over

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,460
your toes and stuff like that

28
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,810
um so how do we build chassis on

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,689
I a my pal how did a lot of the
mechanical stuff

30
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,200
and on this is something I get back to
later if you're doing robots it's like

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,950
Saks you can do it yourself but you want
to do with other people

32
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,149
lot more fun on okay so harm

33
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:57,040
this is Chelsea he was basically a arm
something from the old service station

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,180
and have this wonderful kind

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,119
Art Deco work to him on I he just used
to have casters down there

36
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,009
and way they would use a civil service
stations they put a on

37
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:12,069
this week a barrel love lubrication oil
in it now with more fitting on his head

38
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,360
for a Airfix turn you would basically
went up to your car that your servicing

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,260
and pumpkin oil out a chassis into the
car but arm

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,890
so we are we kinda been proved on that
are we to come apart

41
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,280
we took out all the oil stuff we powder
coated and we strip them down to bare

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,780
metal and powder coated in

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,090
so the was nice and shiny in red on this
is all his arm

44
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,739
locomotion stuff is in his base which
leaves the whole inside him three

45
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,989
for the good stuff the beer on so these
are two motors these are from

46
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,069
arm are electric scooters you can get
them from China super cheap they're

47
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:47,569
great

48
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,440
on I these are some batteries pretty
standard batteries you get him out a

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,989
bomb

50
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,140
we got some surplus ones out a bomb amor
gency lighting for some spy code they

51
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,550
have to re protein from

52
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,440
so so often for you get ones are
basically unused for

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,159
not very much I'm here's the %uh
circuitry stuff this is a motor

54
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,459
controller you might notice that some
movie on

55
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,409
are some other transistors are there are
kinda been unfortunate shape you know

56
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,900
most trains are supposed to have three
make this one

57
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,480
kinda got blown apart on I and the

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,230
what happened to that for speed
controller was on some high school

59
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,780
students got their hands on it

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,980
and all talk about that towards the end
well known this is awesome

61
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,510
because this is how you word on how to
do things and so

62
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,230
I scavenged these motor controllers just
threw in some new

63
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,349
what's the transistors power transistors
and Hound on

64
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,019
nice new speed controllers for not much
money soul most to Cassie's recycled

65
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,510
marine but proud of that

66
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,920
on okay so we took him to Vienna

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,180
on would be a international fest Walcott
to robotics which is an awesome awesome

68
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,950
party if you're ever in Vienna

69
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,750
on in December do not miss it on a

70
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,920
Johannes and monochrome and ships on the
fine pronouncing that right

71
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,180
put this on I think they get some
funding from the the

72
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,209
the be in the city government has in
civilized countries

73
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,730
the government actually supporting arts
things like that so arm

74
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,950
it was like he was a wonderful time and
arm a

75
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,139
everybody enjoys traffickers who what's
not what's not to like

76
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,639
on he was kinda amazing to me and it
still amazes me

77
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,030
we take chassis two parties and things
that people will treat

78
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,449
this piece of junk like it's a person ur
house some kind of intelligence and it's

79
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:29,919
not

80
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,758
right it's just the sum there's a
there's somebody driving around with

81
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,080
remote control maybe somebody talking to
a little

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,699
headset microphone giving it be on
impersonation

83
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,460
love a personally but there's nothing
there on

84
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,570
okay which kinda leads me to my next
said robots emmys

85
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,969
are not humanoid they not nothing like
um

86
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,729
chassis they are spheres and they were
all by themselves this is an art project

87
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,960
called swarm

88
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,948
I did it I on kinetic art robots I did
this

89
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,330
not by myself I did this with a whole
bunch of other people nine

90
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,919
I can't give them all credit they're
probably media forty or fifty people

91
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,109
worked on this project with me

92
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,320
on so this was like connecticut our
project we are

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,849
interested on this gives you an idea
about the scale these things are about

94
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,270
the size to crush a small child

95
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,639
right right

96
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,229
on a we were interested in developing
this project has been a lot of on

97
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,240
research in academic labs about swarming
behavior and Nana bought some things

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,490
like this and this was really
influential to us artistically

99
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,490
what can we do with robots that might be
autonomous Mike

100
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,750
a navigate by themselves on I'll

101
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,710
maybe we can use them as a platform for
choreography doing dancing and things

102
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,370
like that

103
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,789
on maybe we can get choreographers to
come to work with us

104
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,370
are each word house lights and sounds
that you can also program or controlled

105
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,229
remotely

106
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm so we thought this was an
interesting platform to

107
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,370
are to work on no didn't actually were
quite as smoothly as I don't get into

108
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:06,949
that

109
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,800
on so we took it home up to the desert
basically we got some funding from

110
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,090
burning man if you don't know about it
to

111
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,020
I at the end of the summer to join our
party out and Nevada desert

112
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,330
on and people just go there and they do
a lot of stupid stuff

113
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,580
and it's just had a lot of fun on
consider going if you haven't been

114
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,729
on but I to go to Burning Man you buy a
ticket

115
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,270
any small fraction the ticket cost
actually goes to supporting

116
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,190
art and so we got are basically the seed
money for this project

117
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,090
from burning man on to basically by ice
parts which was awesome and we put a lot

118
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,069
of volunteer time

119
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,479
right so you can see out there it's on a
dry lake bed

120
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,550
its hella hot its hella dusty they say
hello in california's gas lawn

121
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,139
school um a so one of the things we had
to

122
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,940
on I do you within our design is Dustin
this does is not just any kinda dust

123
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,199
its alkali dust not with moisture turns
out the electronics about something we

124
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,789
had a

125
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,380
had to think about um all rights

126
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,349
exactly so who know we arm what basic we
we are just a bunch of geeks

127
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,199
we got together on we've worked on other
Burning Man project we know each other

128
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,470
on hit San Francisco and the Bay Area
this was wonderful seeing a kinder

129
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,940
Packers & geeks and I'm

130
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,900
we did this before there was noise
bridge the hackerspace but on we've been

131
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,930
having some meetings at Noisebridge on

132
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,949
and just a wonderful place to do
projects like this on and I'm sure

133
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,060
there's

134
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,430
people centers on energy I'm seeing with
the hackerspace is around here

135
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,610
things like that so on definitely if
this is your kind of thing

136
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,630
zero in on that I'll talk about that
later ok at work on open-source

137
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,469
arm there's no particular boss if you
want something done you do it arm

138
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,610
decision making is kinda distributed on
everybody helps out doing stuff they

139
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,050
want to do here's lisa

140
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,449
on helping well the show love the orb
and Dom

141
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,610
I none of us were expert wilder's when
we started this by the end we work as we

142
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,599
got a lot of practice

143
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,190
on it turns out this unfolding aluminum
which turned out to be hard and takes

144
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,300
one to practice

145
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,400
alright I'm like I said something once

146
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,379
be done you can do with this is i Eric
and he's working on

147
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,410
this is a a pedal-powered carrier for
the robots that

148
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,190
it's a yawn it's a like a conference
bike four people can write it

149
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,219
we got that just shot them around to
Perry's performance parts

150
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,940
was fun on and the question is where do
we get our money

151
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,169
money from to build these things arm
because we're not amortization not a

152
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,399
company were naughty on

153
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,630
renato of incorporated in any way we're
just punch geeks

154
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,600
on so we get we get some money from harm
the art festivals like I'm

155
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,519
I like I mentioned on we took him to a
music festival in Southern California

156
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,330
I'm we do tech festivals with Tim Toohey

157
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,209
attack first one India will talk about
that later are corporate functions

158
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,740
arm local museums have these I evenings
where they serve drinks

159
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,580
and we were all this year's around
that's thats thats that's a good times

160
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,779
and then we paid for stuff ourselves not
a lot

161
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,450
on alright so how the heck do these
things work they were but they don't

162
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,560
have wheels they were all by themselves
in the secret is basically

163
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,110
they just have a big ol heavyweight in
the bottom and they have some motors to

164
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,640
to moving around and what what which
basically do you take this way

165
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,880
and you move it off-center and the the
horrible role in the direction because

166
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,189
you

167
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,410
moved to center of gravity of the center
move map

168
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,170
that direction and on so when it's
rolling this direction you can talk the

169
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,140
way back and forth and if you tilt it

170
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,949
the whole thing told on its axis you can
steer it that way so you have two

171
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,440
degrees of freedom

172
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,600
I former back and kinda left-right
steering

173
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,649
I'm and so more mark-up we did with a
hamster ball

174
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:56,130
turns out we're not the only ones who
thought about this for about five or six

175
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,180
other people doing several robots most
which we learn about

176
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,649
Manuel the project as one does but Tom
%uh

177
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,750
is kinda interesting thing apparently
nasa's talking about using

178
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,329
things like this are may be made a bomb

179
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:13,579
vom base in the air bags to explore mars
in a

180
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,769
they're called tumbleweeds they would
blow around on the wins and can we can

181
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:17,300
tell 'em

182
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,570
that are from our experience are the

183
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,970
Spears they don't do great with hills
and they certainly don't do great with

184
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,250
little depressions they tend to get
stock

185
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,600
on although there are new designs which
have gyroscopes which give you will

186
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,899
react to 14

187
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,180
pop yourself out of things from aren't
so this is what they look like in the

188
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,010
desert at night

189
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,290
with our carrier behind them on

190
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,140
provision showed some video but that
would take all night so sucks you

191
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,360
on I fears are drive mechanics

192
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,060
on how they work a little bit more about
what's going on in the motors

193
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,690
k so the prison the center axle which
goes through basically the center the

194
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,370
shell

195
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,899
is stationary it doesn't move the shell
turns around the axe on this was the

196
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:00,970
drive shaft

197
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,440
which basically takes note most motion
this motor

198
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,610
and on spends the entire shell around
the axe

199
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,100
the arm for this during motor which
basically

200
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,570
shift that heavy battery pack left and
right

201
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,610
to steer with on alright so I

202
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,240
a robots will kick your ass on this is
of getting our asses thoroughly kicked

203
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,769
by hey I'm

204
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,380
I an early prototype and public
nonetheless we made this

205
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,570
I'm show how does thin sheet steel turn
out to be

206
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,769
too thin which was good because we then
went back to the drawing board

207
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,870
are already drawing computer in any case
and on

208
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,810
on my friend Michael whose mechanical
engineer just as wonderful design

209
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,120
production just can't buy spheres

210
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,070
giant metal spheres on I'll let you
can't just like google it and find

211
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,870
spears or us on the internet or
something that will soon so you Spears

212
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,410
on are there are things around but
they're either too heavy

213
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,630
arm to be usually driven by motors were
there too thin

214
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,970
arm for lighting up filled out some
might made this really nice design

215
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,120
which you can basically make out up the
flat sheet

216
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,220
%uh metal in our case 18 inch aluminum

217
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,200
and we got this waterjet cut from some
friends of ours were not supposed to say

218
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,260
who they are but they were very kind

219
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,350
they have a startup and they have a
water jet cutter if you haven't seen a

220
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,630
water jet cutter to computer-controlled

221
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,790
our water jet hits 45 kill a pass Cal's
which is just an enormous amount of

222
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,349
pressure

223
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,690
it will cut through an inch of steel
just using pressurized water

224
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,029
they're kind of amazing and then around
there you can find them on a machine

225
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,980
shops have them they're kinda expensive

226
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,820
on but if you want to do stuff like this
you can do at their places on the

227
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,649
internet you want

228
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,240
stuff like this kinda doubt you can
basically do what the design filing cab

229
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,410
send-off people walk up the stuff out
for you

230
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,459
on so the design is pretty awesome are
here

231
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,790
it fits together if you've ever seen my
toes plywood dinosaur that gets together

232
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,529
like a jigsaw

233
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:00,899
like like that on and we made a little
jig in all fits together and we while

234
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,630
the torch to release all its was pretty
great

235
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,889
from so this is what's inside the

236
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,459
spear in this is called what's called a
chassis and we have some

237
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,480
on want to stuff your a at the top we
have on

238
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,639
an RF communication this is how I like
it

239
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,440
the Spears tell where they are in this
is how we send them commands

240
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,570
on through this we have helped for LED
illuminators

241
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,459
on the the on them we can address which
one we can turn them

242
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,889
any color we want to claim RGB he's on
them

243
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,540
we have a sound module on this is
basically a little car stereo

244
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,540
with the remote controlled mp3 player
you just

245
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,550
put in a of thumb drive with whatever
sounds you want to do

246
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,160
music or on sound effects and I

247
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,389
away you go are on

248
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,639
I heard a lot of people arm explain

249
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,990
when we're running the words the explain
earnestly to the

250
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,470
to each other about how there's a camera
in this dome and that's how we avoid

251
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,829
running into people

252
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:04,829
on turns out there's no camera on factor
no wheel sensors on this

253
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:08,730
to detect people we're doing Wizard of
Oz with remote controls

254
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,160
so on were faking a little bit when
people around on

255
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,360
what this domain is here is to keep the
dust out on the computer stuff so

256
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,550
basically it's just

257
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,470
just as nice Doman we gotta put a gasket
in flapping and you can

258
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,190
just the unscrew the things to get up
the computer in through that dome on

259
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,699
keeps most in the dust out okay so
there's a drive shaft I was saying this

260
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:33,310
rotates around the arm the a

261
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,199
axle to transmit the motor to spin the
shell

262
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,910
on a stirring sermons on a is right
there

263
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,230
on motor controllers are these are
aluminum boxes

264
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,630
kinda rolled or own and at the very
bottom is a battery pack is for the same

265
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,810
on surplus lead acid batteries my ass
about it was good choice for this cuz

266
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,160
are nice and heavy

267
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,610
okay so arm I'll let's talk about the
geek stuff

268
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,949
on a me wanted from fairly sophisticated

269
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,540
a capability so we got some for lease
for skid CPU

270
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,180
on I'll this was a limit on processors
this was pretty much stay the order

271
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,949
when we started building this three
years ago on

272
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:19,399
and he said we although although
software and hardware all our designs

273
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,540
are open source

274
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,910
arm are you we have a wiki were all the
stuff is on if not necessarily

275
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,120
well-organized

276
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,449
but it's all there on we did our custom
TV or

277
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:32,399
daughter board the sits on this and
generates a water real-time signals like

278
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,149
I'm

279
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:37,750
pulse width modulation promoter controls
on this is basically the same class as

280
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,410
an Arduino board the same complexity

281
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,949
on you can program it using the Arduino
tools although we're using

282
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,500
GCC I'm so

283
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,089
free pretty straightforward stuff on
sensors

284
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,389
are fundamental goal is kinda but i
wanna misbehavior so that works have to

285
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,290
know where huge

286
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,969
where they are more the other ones on we
do this using on

287
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,240
navigation sensors and the the global
positioning

288
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,209
thing is a big part in that turns out we
had a put-back outside the show one with

289
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,410
your because I shall interfered with the
radio signals cuz it's a fairly caged a

290
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,209
on a we have on accelerometers

291
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,730
and ya rate gyros and you can turns out
you can put all that

292
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,269
in information together on and then we
are using RF

293
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,630
and i actually wifi for debugging uses
on

294
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,930
on XP Pro which is on my Fink

295
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,880
60 megawatts which gives you something
like a mile line-of-sight

296
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,930
from telecommunications only which is
pretty great

297
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,060
on so arm

298
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,230
what do we do with them what we talking
to the desert and your the desert is

299
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,060
really nice company

300
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,269
super receptive audience out there
they're really can do it

301
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:51,310
on as I said when their people around
the don't how good sensors

302
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,279
to not run over you so we with our
deposit with remote controls were a

303
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,639
little bit ashamed to this because
that's not our

304
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,279
final goal but as far as where people
are going we

305
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,900
safety his bones love primary importance
we just can't guarantee that

306
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,360
these things went well over UN their
heavy and I'm scars on my show and prove

307
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,010
that

308
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,900
alright um a do fun stuff in the desert

309
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,419
everything's better with pyro right so
when you're Mia

310
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,049
we strap was a tied some pyro to it as
part of a big show with some friends bar

311
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:23,849
that had a giant

312
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,119
art piece said spewed fire everything's
awesome

313
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,620
I'm and our so we were pretty happy with
how they work to you can see some that

314
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,419
this is taken at Burning Man you can see
some a fire in the background

315
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,539
and this is what it looks like and I'm
as I mentioned we use our

316
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,650
remote control when there's crowd around
and so we can kinda interact with people

317
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,640
and

318
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,320
dance with Bowmans and last year round
no man usually not steer into them

319
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,189
on so we have a lot of fun with these
are with remote controls we took them to

320
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,020
a lot of places on

321
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,168
a here's one place we took them to coeds
show was its giant

322
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,350
music festival it's in the desert of
southern california

323
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,770
on the year we went was two thousand 8
p.m. Roger Waters and

324
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,049
prince in all sorts of a big deal and on
the

325
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:17,480
organized Coachella know that they can
get art on the cheap from burning man so

326
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,350
they paid us probably what they spend on
the buffet for Prince

327
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,100
I'm guessing maybe less arm and so we we
were happy to go down there and sleep in

328
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,970
tents and

329
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,160
war stuff around and entertain the
ravers on

330
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,120
so you can see from this a this

331
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,620
photograph but the band that we took our
robots to see on this particular evening

332
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,320
was none other than Kraftwerk right and
unlike

333
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,520
like is this some kind of nerd cows in
taking your robots to see Crawford

334
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,750
if right if you don't know Crawford Bay
they basically invented techno

335
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,220
right so on they are their old school um
electro

336
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,429
on the basing cute songs like I you know
I'm the operator with my pocket

337
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,200
calculator but on

338
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,130
your are what's reaction less impressed
them their robots on

339
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,299
alright so that's not be the only place
we took them we also took them

340
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:15,429
to India it was a tech festival in India
call tech reedy they said

341
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:19,140
are you know you wanna comment on few
robots can how do you say no

342
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,360
of course you say yes we'll go to India
to offer robots and I'm

343
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,340
so the they paid for our airfare and
they put us up really nice

344
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,320
and Dom are they showed us around so I'm
here with my

345
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,549
arm I to powell's thats leavin that's
more liens or

346
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:38,970
somewhere hosts from IIT Kanpur IIT is
like the MIT

347
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,640
India those guys are way smarter than
you are mean and those guys are scary if

348
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,450
you've ever seen

349
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,520
entrance exam to get into IIT it is I'm

350
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,660
it is a few or something so and they
were super nice to us

351
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,340
on and the host an awesome so we're a
little brown in arm

352
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,559
in the up this attack fair and this is
basically what we saw they were

353
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,330
people were very into what we're pretty
much what we were swarmed arm

354
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,750
a a lot of people didn't really know
what to think

355
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:11,630
arm this kind a mechanical art is not a
big thing in a lotta places on

356
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,970
very common question was sir can you
tell me what business purpose these

357
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,289
things happen

358
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:21,530
that bout was a little tough to answer
I'm not sure I really have a good good

359
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,149
question about that other than maybe
over draws a crowd

360
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,620
from so a dots what it was like

361
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,590
on outside this is right outside the eye
toward IIT come for campus

362
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,059
and I it's really like that it was great
arm

363
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,190
seeing seeing a different culture and
how they're how they react to things

364
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,890
arm and the basically the a

365
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,110
we we had a good time alright

366
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,679
um and are so one of the things I you
know

367
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,039
I'll me up but the but the crowd
together with tools

368
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,890
on and we took our own tools and we had
to take him back to take the tools back

369
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,210
we had to put him in the crate

370
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,750
which is a problem how do you close the
crate with the tools to close the crate

371
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,280
inside the crate so

372
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,620
on this was a a this is a a a cricket
bat just happen to be lying around which

373
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,720
was a good thing

374
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,020
I'm alright so on I'm gonna kick out a
little bit

375
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,158
%uh basically put up the slide just to
show you were badass

376
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,169
about this economy thing we're still
working on it we have made some

377
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:23,830
significant progress

378
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,330
on a cowman filter is a statistical

379
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,928
our method vom sensor fusion basically

380
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,570
cowman filtered out the Apollo rocket to
the moon on it's a well-known algorithm

381
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,879
are and we have the sensor inputs like
to mention the GPS think someone's

382
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,490
so longer on the gyroscopes the odometer
we can measure how much how far we've

383
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:44,950
wall

384
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,549
basically just by counting the
revolution the sphere

385
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:53,760
on so are you cowman filter ITT's will
recognize in fact the

386
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,879
extended Kalman filter data jacoby in
their town when your eyes and stuff cuz

387
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,960
its nonlinear

388
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,190
and this is actually on the cow moose
moose thing

389
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,419
arm see I think PR

390
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,480
the GPS is in reading the cowman filter
is in blue with the

391
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,210
on with the to a conclusion while the
other data

392
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,480
on for this test for basically running
around

393
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,260
the central circle abuse soccer field or
on

394
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,179
a football pitch depending on what you
want to call it on the not so I think 12

395
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,010
meters in diameter something so he had
his arm

396
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,400
a who was pretty good and we working on
path planning this is actually real data

397
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,730
R-rated the desired path and green is
the actual path for

398
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,750
kinda be in normally on how tight we can
make some of those turns

399
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,030
but we are working on harm are doing
some worked on a mist of

400
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,590
and working on you can do we hope that
very simple algorithms will have some

401
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,090
interesting behavior like this from
swarming all rooms where you can say

402
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,280
okay gaining on everybody go to the
sender um

403
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,020
gravity of the group but don't get to
any closed don't get too close to any

404
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,900
particular

405
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,710
wanna be your neighbor's and I'm they're
flocking algorithms with

406
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,820
which people use for CGI to do I know
troop movements warbirds

407
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,480
or fish schools a fish we want to do
this in real life from working on this

408
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,110
right now arm this stuff is kinda workin
work I know if

409
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,390
a little bit stumped on where to do this
this works

410
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,220
really nice on after church would you go
to a real part basically doesn't

411
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,600
you know there's little difference where
there where the ground has been extra

412
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:29,900
for

413
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,610
fertilized by dogs on the grill the
grass is maybe a little stiffer

414
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,580
stuff like that messes up so need to do
a little bit better job on the feedback

415
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,299
and actually doing navigation for the
for work in

416
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,889
in in less controlled scenarios

417
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,450
alright so that's about get for the
technical

418
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,820
portion of the talk and maybe you're
thinkin on

419
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,059
are while are you know rock festivals
and travel

420
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:00,010
to me exotic places I'm this sounds like
the lifestyle for me said John tell me

421
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,549
how do I get started with robot

422
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:05,408
and the next last couple slides are on
some resources to do that

423
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:09,870
on caper sling are if wanna work right
com I'd say Eve

424
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,909
if you wanna robot for five minutes
gonna spend an hour

425
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:18,470
fiction that goldman et tune it up on
they break par

426
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,080
these particular ones we never built
anything like this before

427
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,570
so a some things we might have done
differently now that we've done it

428
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,408
already but was up wonderful warning
experience

429
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:33,049
arm alright so ways to get stock started
with robotics I

430
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:36,200
I I you're from cheers who knows about

431
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,320
about Balboa FIRST Robotics okay

432
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,450
if you don't know about FIRST Robotics
I'm gonna tell you cuz you for the

433
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,480
awesome this is

434
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,710
founded by Dean came in it's a program
for

435
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:52,350
students in high school and even younger
on basically the high school

436
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:57,100
tweaks over the winter every high school
I think about more than a thousand per

437
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,230
schools participating this all over the
country all over the world

438
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,490
every high school gets a box apart and
the ball the robot

439
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,260
and at the end of the building time they
compete with other high schools

440
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,600
on in a non-violent challenge cause like
robot soccer or this one I think you

441
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,510
have to look at these balls over think

442
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,429
on it is awesome if your high school
experience was why it was like mine

443
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:21,600
you know the value up some cool geeks
coming in

444
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,510
to you and say hey there is life after
high school you will survive right

445
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:29,710
on and Dean cayman arm you should really
watch this

446
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,919
on on the first are US first on your
website

447
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,070
how's this are video introduction where
he speaks absolutely from the heart and

448
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,070
he's saying

449
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:43,418
you know in this culture we reward
sports stars the music stars know the

450
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:44,529
athletes and people

451
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:47,620
what about the people make sure you have
clean water to drink what about the

452
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,450
people who make sure that your elevators
don't crash into what about the finders

453
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,309
an engineer who were responsible for all
this awesome stuff we have no work

454
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:59,059
his we have come computers in our pants
now right

455
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,168
why aren't those guys rock stars to
right they should be

456
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,289
I'm so I he a he started this program

457
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:09,289
are doing came in he did the Segway
airsoft on

458
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,750
a so fold-out are you can get a taste in
engineering

459
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,029
on in high school and hang out with
nerds and other nerds and it's just the

460
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,250
best thing in the world

461
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,460
am if you want to learn to do robots go
volunteer for one of the things

462
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,179
let the kids make all the mistakes what
the kids but out the magic smoke

463
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,960
right right on its awesome way to learn
and that sucks I want one ways I got

464
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,400
into that

465
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,020
and I'm a I can't say enough good things
about it

466
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,340
on I will with with anybody I i've seen

467
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,140
it's been around for 10 years so I'm
actually met some people were in this

468
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,120
at in high school was anybody yeah
alright so for power to you you guys

469
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,789
know how awesome this witness's

470
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,450
which was around when I was in high
school on definitely

471
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,179
good stuff alright calm I this is kinda

472
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,059
are Bay Area centric I apologize but
there's something called the homebrew

473
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,240
Robotics Club

474
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,820
are this a you may remember something
called the Homebrew Computer Club

475
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,450
also in the Bay Area this is basically
where her arm

476
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,740
stephen was brought their first
prototypes to and hung out with

477
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,110
people kinda I think in the same state
of development your robots are not ready

478
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,200
for prime time

479
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,230
back in the seventies when the Homebrew
Computer Club was going

480
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,700
a computers are not ready for prime time
look how far they've come

481
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,190
look how far we might be able to go with
robots and right now is the time to get

482
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,210
into it because you can do it as a
hobbyist

483
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,370
okay on maybe you're not in the Bay Area
there are all sorts of my alarm

484
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,090
Nuggets living Nexus is on are
excitement around technology building

485
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,700
stuff

486
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,169
are supporting local hackerspace
hackerspace don't worry I think there's

487
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:51,620
and least to win new york city that is
what three or four in Boston are all

488
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,700
over the place

489
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,240
on there's offered some awesome open
source hardware

490
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,700
arm car maker bot are you can build your
own

491
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,330
C&C a deposition machine on how to
fruits part fun

492
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,350
are mournful were here on

493
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,409
a are I didn't put him on a fight I
should have mention Jimmy will teach you

494
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,570
how to solder if you're following new

495
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,918
I go do with its easy it's fun to get to
know metal

496
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,110
its grave on they're doing I think all
weekend down as inane

497
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,149
on tell my sent you they're awesome it's
really easy actually fun

498
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:30,820
on everybody was a newborn's I was a new
don't let that stop you can't really fun

499
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,760
on so anyway are so maybe you've seen
all this kinda community stuff

500
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,879
and this nonviolent competition will
maybe that's not your thing it's like

501
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,520
up maybe this is your thing on

502
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,070
when the games alright combat robotics
they may not be on TV but

503
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,270
you can bet your ass they are still
around and they are not on the shit out

504
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,408
of each other it's amazing all right
right

505
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:57,539
if you're one up build something and put
it in the powerful something that looks

506
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,149
like a lawn mower with titanium blaze or
something

507
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:03,470
this is the place to do it or flavor
harm

508
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,679
okay if you go to all the games done
that in your into this there is

509
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,309
something like in four hundred page PDF

510
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,970
honored on of on their homepage on their
fight

511
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,299
which tells you arms are there's a whole
eco-system a people building combat

512
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,230
robot parts you can buy

513
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,710
kick ass speed controllers you can buy
wheels you can buy chassis is

514
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,870
if you wanna for a lotta money at it on
I you can do that and go to kick ass

515
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,240
what I would recommend that the first
time did you can get your ass handed to

516
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,750
you

517
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,490
but on you can definitely start up on
every every year

518
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,010
in the Bay Area is rubble games and
people come from all over the world to

519
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,450
do this

520
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,090
combat a robot combat competition

521
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:46,690
great home I don't know how much doing
on time but I'm pretty close to done so

522
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:53,690
thank you for your attention I project

523
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,240
got some time for questions

524
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,240
anybody's got any really love your work

525
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,460
I was curious if somebody wanted to get
into this commercially

526
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,010
like not just as a art hobby um

527
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,200
if you is there a professional
applications for the sort of work or

528
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,750
are you more going to be doing like a
research in a lab

529
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,440
or on there's all sorts of things is a
number start-ups that are doing

530
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,490
arm robot's arm any parts

531
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,620
a

532
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,940
I'm couple things which I'm forgetting
the names of

533
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,500
arm some those places are hiring others
people

534
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,730
on for commercial applications a lot of
medical robotic

535
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,220
applications on there's a lot of
research

536
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,120
in want the universities are Carnegie
Mellon's been doing what's for a long

537
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,830
time

538
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,889
on Cornell are berkeley the

539
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,770
Santa Cruz arm once I'm were I'm sure to
watch more

540
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,610
I'm doing bad I stop on were gone looked
on YouTube you can see

541
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,620
the the autonomous helicopters and
things like that great stuff

542
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,820
on did not answer your question well I
was thinking more

543
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,299
in line with the specific projects that
you've done I guess same question the

544
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:17,480
people in India past

545
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,210
right right yeah and I I don't have a
have a good arm

546
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,280
answer there is a Dr there's a Danish
company I think

547
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,360
on in Scandinavia which is making I

548
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,559
something called rotunda switches a
spherical robot and I think your

549
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,490
application is for on

550
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,620
security like this thing will roll are
wall

551
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,650
take to replace replaces the security
guard him

552
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,380
roll around your perimeter and my crush
intruders and stuff like that rover

553
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,110
exactly exactly exactly like a like the
prisoner

554
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,669
arm I'm not sure what state that is in
but the

555
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:53,200
they seem to be existing in the wall
they have pictures at that thing rolling

556
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,590
around

557
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,720
there things cool concealed what
actually go on water

558
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,419
robots here

559
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:07,010
I do not I'm sorry on strike

560
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:14,010
bring robot on Sunday x1 was gonna be
ham radio play

561
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,660
robots on Sunday by the hammer your
place other questions

562
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,950
yet so was the best as you've taken %uh
the swarm so far

563
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,910
are the the fastest surpasses yet this
is a good question people ask

564
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,240
how fast do they go and my answer that
is faster than you can

565
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,530
run yeah I i so

566
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:37,928
are yeah I to daschle beyond the
searchers react to strip down that the

567
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:39,400
top speed quite a bit

568
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,160
on because we can over design the motor
controllers which is not a bad thing

569
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,919
on but York for some reason want one
gets away from you

570
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,690
wanna be able to track it down there's a
is a funny story on we have kill

571
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,500
switches

572
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,790
arm on the axle where you can turn off
the power to the motor

573
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,129
on just in case one starts misbehaving
arm

574
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,530
they don't do it often but now on now
and then they will

575
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,970
and I'm we talked to the desert and
turns out those switches managed to get

576
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,900
from Dustin on we thought they were more
dust resistant than they were so we

577
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,300
reduced to begging for

578
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,580
condoms I'd covered the switches to

579
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,210
just prefer have a broken any bones

580
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,830
are not to my knowledge only headache we
have run into a number people

581
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:28,540
thanks trip this is a bit off topic
again said

582
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,030
that cricket bet your mission was in
case of a zombie invasion think

583
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,050
I guess it was just lying there but it
was certainly Andy

584
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:40,020
by

585
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,429
thanks John for his child out for
aerobics article.thanks lot

586
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,929
so my question would be you had to
projects they're like her

587
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:51,730
and names like an anthropomorphic point
the

588
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,200
like robot like it metalic men

589
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,809
right like a mechanical man mechanical
man and you had something like a sphere

590
00:33:58,809 --> 00:33:59,750
rolling around

591
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,840
and in general like their robots all
around us

592
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,280
all the time like an ATM is a robot like
subway is a robot

593
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,168
to an extent in most of the robots are
there are kinda like enslaved

594
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:15,230
the have to carry people around you have
to give out cash stuff like that

595
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,719
they have to weld stupid cars that no
one wants to buy okay

596
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,840
yeah so a my basic idea would be at the
popular reception robots is still more

597
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,080
like a sissy

598
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,790
and not at that rolling sphere and so

599
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:34,119
I think more and more robots should be
out there who do not fulfil these stupid

600
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,000
like r2 d2 -like

601
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,330
as cancer kinda thing your I so

602
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,409
I think we all should like ghettos heads
together and think I've robots that are

603
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:45,050
not like this stupid

604
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,760
like nineteen fifties future robots out
there that's just like my

605
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,050
my five cents up to wind up to that
effect at one point

606
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,980
what's good are only limited by your
imagination if you can think up a cooler

607
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,450
one

608
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:02,740
I bet you can do it be awesome thank you
arm

609
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,650
so I keep hearing in the news about all
these on me and military vehicles

610
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,760
arm just anyone in the hobby is key in
the know with their

611
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,670
real how related these are to the kind
of stuff that you can build at home

612
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:22,160
for are not allowed to know that I have
yeah oh well arm

613
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,680
others the company had a Boston called I
will what which does arm

614
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,819
are basically our room not too different
from chassis I mean obviously much more

615
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,619
sophisticated

616
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,930
remote control things with Tom are motor
actuator arm

617
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,649
in a video and that's for disarming I E
dewey's

618
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,869
and the you're actually using those in
combat mom

619
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:45,050
things but this is under complete human
control

620
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,720
on and then its course Predator drones
and things which are also supposedly

621
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,310
under human control

622
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,750
I personally don't know about things
which are economists

623
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,480
are I be a little scared about that
because on I

624
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,600
you know things are not back lever to
begin with

625
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,569
and I'm I'm not sure effective

626
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,500
if that answers your question there are
robot with military applications

627
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,650
on the battlefield right now I don't
know anything about

628
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:18,650
on a Thomas wants

629
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,920
at some point the doc the dark a grand
challenge where they have the arm

630
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,670
that cars it basically have to navigate
autonomously over a long distance

631
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,810
I'm and that is funded by car bus so
guess what they're gonna do it

632
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,060
when he got word also the reason the DIY
drums at all

633
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,220
is a website that is basically an
amateur community for doing

634
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,050
a autonomous or self-guided aerial
vehicles

635
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,060
your about five hundred dollars and some
elbow grease

636
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,230
away from having mean it's a very
lightweight cruise missile if that's

637
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,130
what you want to do

638
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:59,730
I and the capabilities are actually
surprisingly

639
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,080
good because it's this wonderful
intersection love the model aircraft

640
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,990
community that have long since

641
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,930
worked out how to fly many many pounds
of things when extended amount of time

642
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,040
and achievement rise electronics and
right now you can

643
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,570
it's likely I think three hundred
dollars for Spock fun to buy a six

644
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,570
degree of freedom GPS guided

645
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,280
I and you know that you can plug into
your choice george was a model aircraft

646
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,119
so I there's a lot of fun them thank you
X on point and a glaring omission from

647
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,000
my presentation I want that exact

648
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,240
there's actually just this week the
minister defends the UK announced that

649
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,100
they have

650
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,770
a prototype they say it's not ever gonna
be used in a field warfare

651
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,190
but it is supposed to be completely
autonomous but somebody at the end

652
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,480
articles but

653
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,570
how well I kill switch works I don't
know whenever they decided in

654
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,410
I can I pose as I can remember the
actual name of that but then in the

655
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,210
tough killed the God of War

656
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,550
which doesn't exactly from the full sir

657
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,210
okay how are we doing on time reserved
there's a time

658
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,589
15 minutes okay I got some time for are
more questioning also

659
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:03,690
taking a break before the next series
awesome

660
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,950
do you have any information about the
Korean robots

661
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,290
along the border with North Korea that
I've just been deployed recently

662
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,920
I can on

663
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,589
for what's the strangest

664
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:27,350
failure mode that you hit with the
spheres strangers failure mode on

665
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,210
that's a that's a good one a

666
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,660
so the scene new lost their sensors are

667
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,589
is a sure all feedback which sense are
you tell the

668
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:42,330
motor to put the we did a certain angle
supposed to go there

669
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,670
arm and basically I sometimes a

670
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,100
if you're given a big enough get damn
thing what kinda we going there some

671
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,910
so you see these these Spears and
they're kinda shinning

672
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,470
their is kinda me but completely
unattended in kinda wrong

673
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,589
and we finally fixed it but it was kinda
cool emergent behavior normal ask if

674
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,650
it's coming this month in your thing in

675
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,350
PA you move in doing control on it
wasn't wasn't a good

676
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,400
solution that control problem but was
kinda cool

677
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,410
so the road done any work with the

678
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,910
artificial intelligence and the robots
are no no

679
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,109
arm hurts their coming from a background
in machine learning and things like that

680
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,049
and I think

681
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,710
AI's a little bit of a misnomer I'm
because I don't think things are really

682
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,410
that smart

683
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,460
all arm a

684
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,650
and I think if you want to call it a I
this kinda

685
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,380
arm autonomous navigation is about as
close as you can to find in there may be

686
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,140
other things to do that

687
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,960
but this is this for a Thomas

688
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,109
navigations kind where we've been
focusing our time

689
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:49,160
how long do you think we have until the
revolution comes in our robot overlords

690
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,850
takeover

691
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,069
I for one am not losing any sleep at all
over know these things you realize how

692
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:02,670
brittle how fragile the stuff he isn't
just getting the work at all it's kinda

693
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,830
miraculous so I'm

694
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,259
I'm I wouldn't I wouldn't lose any sleep
but Tom

695
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,600
yeah i cant I can't propre

696
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,460
prognosticate too far in the future
stuff changes so quickly

697
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,480
also do you have any plans for using the
orbs for cooperative robotics research

698
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,510
I want all our stuff is it is open
source on

699
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,550
somebody we're gonna put our datasets
our days such are online

700
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,359
for on for adopting I'm so are we
started this before a lot of the arm

701
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,540
are open autonomous vehicle stuff was
done

702
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,589
we could probably use user a lot of
their own

703
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:42,900
code arm so we wound up reinventing the
wheel

704
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,020
on but I it's all there for sharing and
if there's something that will save us

705
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,560
time were

706
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,080
not world we're definitely on keep

707
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,950
just a quick question I'm just some beer
next projects that are coming up

708
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,310
our next project arm personally basic I
just got a little grant to do

709
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,270
%uh something I call arm a cargo for
completely

710
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:09,230
atop a awesome robotic a autonomous desk
lamps and these are

711
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:13,630
experiment you right you basically just
desk lamps you get from Ikea

712
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,930
basin but some churros on them gonna
make five or six bomb

713
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:20,620
up gonna put a high brightness LED's in
phnom

714
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,580
so you can change their color you also
make them nice white for nice work lamp

715
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,740
on and these things will a hopefully be
able to track things round point

716
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,819
particular directions are you press a
button

717
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:36,210
and it's party time in the point in the
ceiling and they do

718
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,650
cool colors things like this and strobe
and maybe move

719
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,890
moving center me

720
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,910
right right right right right that's
gonna be version to where they actually

721
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,310
walk around like I like boxer junior
right right

722
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,740
your was activated yet that's a

723
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,800
but want tougher but we do that r8 arm

724
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,460
I right but the central Blood Center

725
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,859
arm are right arm in the absence of more

726
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:09,230
are questions one might stop your and
that gives people time to run and get a

727
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,940
drink or something for the next panel
which I believe is on hackerspace is not

728
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,089
right

729
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:17,130
right which is gonna be totally awesome
and I don't wanna miss it so I'm gonna

730
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,120
stop right here

731
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,839
thank you for your time
