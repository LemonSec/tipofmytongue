1
00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:03,189
and the

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,649
the purposes talk it's going to be
mostly entered a introductory we're

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:08,820
gonna go over the two common tools that
are used

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,200
on their where they can be gotten their
availability other functionalities and

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,410
our then after that how they're used

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,448
how the how the stolen data is converted
into cash

7
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,550
and then how do obtain that cash arm

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,760
the tools of the trade that we're going
to be going over arm for we have

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,510
for our concourse to exploit kits we
have the Eleanor exploit kit

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,260
and fracas on those are a very uncommon
drive-by download software

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,019
arm for actual payloads arm will be
going over the Zeus Trojan and spy I

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,230
as use is my has been pretty much the
standard of digital crime since Aug

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,660
since about 2007

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,739
and spy i has recently emerged farmers
as a competitor

15
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:52,320
and then I as for the monetization of
stolen data go over our

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,129
resale carting arm the wire transfers

17
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,019
fake fake merchant accounts and then the
actual of cashing out laundering ovett

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,289
arm for

19
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:06,330
common methods of infection on the way
the

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,530
and I'm sure many have you ever
experienced air seen it are you go to a

21
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,180
website

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,700
has a malicious iframe in it with some
that with some malicious javascript

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,659
it attempts to exploit your browser
often steer was successfully

24
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,570
are you can use anything from a Java
exploit to a flash exploit a PDF exploit

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,700
to explore

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,720
a basic anything can do to crash the
browser get

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,039
a malicious executable port for anywhere
on the web infected machine and then on

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,280
it arm

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,369
without drive-by downloads is also ways
to

30
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,390
spread infections still typical spanning
three male

31
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,670
back during the torrents from dirty
sites are just dumb

32
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,720
was straight up my Milam USB Drive
switchblades

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,229
on this is a screenshot have the Eleanor
exploit pack

34
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:54,229
arm this the on the screen shot shows a
a list of the operating systems

35
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,820
arm there about 8,250 hits on Windows XP

36
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,210
3,680 on Windows Vista arm the exploits
at this uses the

37
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,959
MSU eyes user to which is in Internet
Explorer 6 exploit a.m. DAC

38
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,040
job x-play and and this this PDF

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,170
2012 this was the old arm

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,050
PDF zero-day that was but made a big
deal about a few months ago

41
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,560
arm it's since been patched but this
this exploit kit

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,550
was hitting it before it was patched and
on this is the

43
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,560
statistics page the exploit packed a
very

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,709
their very organizer very sophisticated
content management systems

45
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,269
on this is keeping track of every
browser that touches the exploit kit

46
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,560
on how many hits and how many successful
exploitation had

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,599
arm the most successful one on here are
was

48
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,500
are the most commonly used was Internet
Explorer 8 and help from five thousand

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,720
hits they had about 425 successful
infections

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,519
but that's about it 8.13 success rate
and on

51
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,650
Internet Explorer 6 they had a 12
percent infection rate they

52
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,680
they had about to 209 UHV

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,430
1,716 infected machines and those are

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,640
are those are successfully deployed
payload so on that's

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,330
that they're building up quite a nice
little botnet with some with this

56
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:12,920
package

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,989
this is a this is

58
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,610
a screenshot of the installer page have
the unique exploit pack

59
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,209
I'm a competitor Eleanor very similar
functionalities

60
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,580
on all these exploit kits operate in a
standard php/mysql

61
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,140
arm content management system they've
got to a MySQL database

62
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,470
on the exploits are kept in PHP files
and in their called upon

63
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,540
arm once they're once their hit arm from
the

64
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,879
from the malicious iframe this is the
phoenix exploit kit

65
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,959
are another love competitor to the other
two arm they all

66
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,980
pretty much serve the same purpose they
generate iframes on the fly

67
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,879
with the known exploits are and
sometimes era de ces kits

68
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,810
usually go for a few hundred dollars to
a few thousand dollars on carting forms

69
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,060
or any other Mauer form

70
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,459
arm usually by and directly from the
author or if the reseller so

71
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,640
a light and resellers will back dorm
setting said they can now

72
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,120
also get access to the compromised
machines

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,629
on this is one of the nicer ones this is
the fracas exploit kit

74
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,570
it's got a real spiffy Ajax interface
arm it's got you don't have to know

75
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,250
anything about coding you need to know
how to write HTML you need to know an

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,030
iframe

77
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,620
you can pretty much pay someone to
install this on a on a host for you

78
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,270
and you can just start generating the
Cody need to start sticking places and

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,299
infecting people

80
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,100
are made it seemed as you can see in the
bottom Scott up near check boxes which

81
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,389
exploits wanna hit

82
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,729
armed a.m. Dec exploit morning explorers

Armidale pretty evens have it select
oliver man hit all-american just target

84
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,130
specific explosive you know the traffic
that's going to be hittin the page

85
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,000
arm normally the a browser will hit the
page once

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,650
are middle attempt to exploit and then
when you and then a redirect you to

87
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,800
something innocent like Google see don't
really know what happened to start to

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,449
see

89
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,449
the machine behaving strangely

90
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,690
and arm what is the payload that is

91
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,380
most commonly deployed with the with
next week it's

92
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,840
the most common one is disease Trojan
arm its use by pretty much love

93
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,850
all the miscreants UHV the love the way
you got spammers script kiddies

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,620
organized crime fisher's

95
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,039
arm cars though they were on this is
kind of a

96
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,159
a one-size-fits-all Trojan that will
that does all sorts of nastiness army

97
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,539
can be propagated through any the
methods we just discussed before span

98
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,039
fishing pier to Pier

99
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,900
are mem- iframes on malicious web sites
and the way it works

100
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,370
is it will it all hooked into alarm hour
or just create a separate service you in

101
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,030
press Control Alt Delete you'll see some
weird thing your task manager may be

102
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,650
checking a misconfigured see some weird
things running

103
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,009
zoos will not do any that's useful hook
servicios de XE

104
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,180
it to act like a legit electrical
legitimate windows process

105
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,430
and run silently are every 25 minutes
it'll be can now to the command control

106
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,090
server

107
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,139
with unencrypted post requesting cryptid
with rc4 encryption

108
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,250
and armpits and just also very summit
next week it's just a php/mysql

109
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,270
arm camara a interface with some

110
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,729
with an executable that oh that's built
with the with a builder that comes with

111
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:15,669
the package

112
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,889
and every half hour and effective
machine will be going out to the

113
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,120
to command control server and it'll have
a log love

114
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,600
all the POST request has been sent all
the all the bank logins on the View

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,380
states of

116
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,560
our cookies arm every arm no

117
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,740
every credit card number every form
field that's been entered and sent in a

118
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,639
POST request

119
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,490
it will log it encrypt with rc4 and then
beacon it out to the command control

120
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,009
server

121
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:43,360
on port 80 so you Yai if you're looking
for traffic on weird ports in where

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,199
traffic you're not confined because
justice just using

123
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,060
it's behaving as it should tell you
United uniting a really done is just

124
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,180
look for

125
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,940
rc4 traffic coming out over forty is
some weird website they've never heard

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,229
of

127
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,610
home this is a this is a screenshot

128
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,099
love these use command control
interfaces this is an an older version

129
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,659
the new the newest version is a

130
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,780
2.0 it it still looks pretty much the
same arm

131
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,210
this is our that this views the software
E

132
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,630
retails for about two hundred to to
order books five

133
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,770
25 grand on there's a few leaked
versions are out for free

134
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,380
arm courses are up those are back toward
fuse if you use those someone will

135
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,690
quickly take over

136
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,370
and our that this this particular one
that we got access to the command

137
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,520
control center of

138
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,549
they had %uh five thousand up by
thousands

139
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,090
sector so if I infected machines and
four million nine hundred thousand

140
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,130
reports

141
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,840
and the database so this it was a very
it was been all but net had been sitting

142
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,620
around for a while just collecting data
from the six thousand infected machines

143
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,620
and eventually built up to 4.9 million
reports

144
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,949
and that's that adds up to a lot of
passwords credit card numbers

145
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:53,979
and session cookies I'm here's a an
example the report header

146
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,159
I've blacked out now relevant
information

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,160
its his it gives the but I D each
infected machine will have an ETA a

148
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,410
unique identifiers for that machine

149
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,720
our military the version of the love the
payload that infected machine

150
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,340
work ill finger print the entire
operating system give the IP address

151
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,560
and at the bottom where it says source
farm this is a log from when it Jackson

152
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,190
payback

153
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,379
some pay pal credentials on this next
page receive the

154
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:23,940
report above that are men its its
grabbed everything

155
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,169
the the login email login password
firstname lastname credit card number

156
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,229
last three digits billing address

157
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,279
arm that and additional email address
city state zip

158
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,490
everything you need to did pretty much
do any type of fraud that

159
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,620
arm that you would like arm

160
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,830
now Zeus also has many plugins available
third party plugins that are targeted

161
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,130
did that are targeted directly for
financial institutions primarily Zeus is

162
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,959
a banking Trojan it targets

163
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,839
financial institutions that money can be
stolen are there are

164
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,120
plugins that are written and using a
function called web injured

165
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,630
the web in Jax apps use where it will
rewrite

166
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,880
the HTTP response arm for for your

167
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,300
arm when you log into your bank and you
get the HTTP response for screen

168
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,990
it will give it will inject additional
form parameters

169
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,500
and those for prayers will be what's
required to initiate the wire transfer

170
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,680
but your just think it's your bank
asking for additional security questions

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,279
I'll their

172
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,720
their increasing their security so you
fill out the form are

173
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,649
as soon as you fill those out it goes
back to this it checked in with this

174
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,540
meal software in on the specific one arm
it tells it to automatically transfer

175
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,719
between five to seven thousand dollars

176
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,399
the moment that it comes through and so
the moment at the former sold out

177
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,430
does a cross-site request forgery to the
to the bank and transfers the money out

178
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,860
to a mule accountant and this is a a
mule CMS arm program

179
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,390
and everyday up for its its schedule as
soon as someone

180
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,850
blogs n initiate this transfer so
they'll be polling

181
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,740
they even if just falling one person a
day that still five to seven grand a day

182
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
that they're doing

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,829
and they're definitely doing it to more
than one person if they have several

184
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,430
several thousand machines on their
botnet and arm

185
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,050
thats there one other one other real arm

186
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,959
real nice meal software is called on URL
zone

187
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,750
where it'll do the ill it'll do that by
in addition

188
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,000
to injecting the forms in initiating AFP
wire transfer in the back end

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,140
it will rewrite your statement on the
HTTP response so you don't see a balance

190
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,819
change

191
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,050
looks like nothing is taken place and to
actually go to the ATM

192
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,060
and arm those deuces also are
notoriously difficult to detect

193
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,450
are my took a payload from the zoo's
tracker which is a

194
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,300
I A a tracker that monitors unknowns use
command control servers

195
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,600
I i just took a payload directly from
the tracker been around for months it

196
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,060
was

197
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,709
well known it was flagged and I uploaded
to virustotal

198
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,940
less than half detected after I'd say
about that the time it had been about

199
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,880
six months

200
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,240
less than half detected that the the
specific publix is payload

201
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,360
honors for the 19 at forty arm

202
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,390
I'd decide to take a little further and
just run the executable through a very

203
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,180
common free

204
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,720
code obfuscation this program is made
for a legitimate developers to protect

205
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,089
their code to my dad licensing they want
to prevent people D compiling it

206
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,380
others above a million and one
legitimate uses for this program

207
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,230
but if you also run our through it
rewrites the signature and

208
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,420
makes it much more difficult to detect
for many viruses

209
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,699
so I took this known payload ran it
through the right through the obfuscator

210
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,380
and reuploaded to virustotal

211
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,850
and

212
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,060
and only five out of 41 detected

213
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,079
the diet drops from of drop down to 12
percent

214
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:50,529
arm everything pretty much failed it

215
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,700
even the ones that flagged it only
flagged as suspicious the in flag it as

216
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,600
Mauer the and flag it as

217
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,130
armed as you stroll Jersey but they just
said somethings

218
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,450
of about this you might want to look
into it but everything else gave it gave

219
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,529
it the green light

220
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:11,589
and competing with Zeus is spy I

221
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,380
arm it's a very similar I'm it's got a
much nicer and a face to make you serve

222
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,410
Ajax

223
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,370
are sells for about 500 bucks and it
will clean years use infection

224
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,470
when you get hit with it the the reason
it does this leave

225
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,110
there that there is it does is it wants
to be the only banking hour on the

226
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,639
machine

227
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,000
the date the a the the author said in an
interview with The

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,089
them our intelligence blog you saying
that a we're going to start seeing

229
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,290
trends where

230
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,760
Mauer authors will implement better
antivirus solutions any antivirus

231
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,459
vendors

232
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,519
not because they care these don't want
the competition they don't want weird

233
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,149
conflicts preventing data from going to
where it's supposed to go

234
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,690
so spy I will cleans use infections but

235
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,880
leave you aspire

236
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,570
and he is now the screen shot into the
statistics panel I blanked out the

237
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,740
the IP addresses um for obvious reasons
and

238
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,660
it's it's a much nicer interface that
has arm its

239
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,649
its I'll mmm all AJAX based and Dom

240
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,010
at its best very nice and the the
payload is also

241
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,740
mmm more difficult to detect Zeus
because it is

242
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,480
it is used by far less people and arm

243
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,550
we we r actually found OMF

244
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,670
found 0 a website where someone had
uploaded

245
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,889
a copy of the spy a Trojan and 50 out of
50 failed

246
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:38,570
the antivirus test it was it completely
sailed through 100 percent clear

247
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,120
and arm the and that at that's not
uncommon thats

248
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,410
the majority love these types of Mauer
the only ones are getting caught are

249
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,439
real big sloppy campaigns

250
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,660
if someone wants to if someone really
wants to set it up

251
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,019
you know Antivirus is gonna fix your two
years you're still going to get hit

252
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,070
and you have to anyone even know it
because on what most area he was an hour

253
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,970
you start getting popups your machine
gets slow there's a whole bunch of

254
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,430
indicators that something's wrong these
runs silently

255
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,510
there there they're designed so that you
you think

256
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,880
everything is okay your computers
running as normal as justice

257
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,850
keeping a little log and then be coming
out unencrypted post every half hour to

258
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,680
the command control center

259
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,100
and arm it it's a its been very
effective over the last several years

260
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,880
and is calling its causing a lot of
problems

261
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,470
now once you have all this data you know
say there's the

262
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,579
people with the five million reports
what do they do with it

263
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,720
well they can either sell it to other
fraudsters which is a very common

264
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,730
arm that's and it forms all over the
place where they're selling Zeus data

265
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,029
and credit card data

266
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,100
they can either sell it by the Gigabyte
if they don't want to sort it or they

267
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,720
can break it up and go through and
analyze and sell it now

268
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,980
Senate individually if the why invest
the time

269
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,620
arm though they could use that data for
carting word just typically ordering

270
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,810
stuff having it sent to a dropper

271
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,959
you just said tipper York the old known
carting

272
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,380
and I'm 120 interesting things is a a
lot of a murdered there's been a case

273
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,350
where the FTC just discovered arm

274
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,820
about ten million dollars a fraud
through a hundred different merchant

275
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,480
accounts

276
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,339
and basically what some people were done
is eight set up a several hundred

277
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,889
merchant accounts in different states
and it did in order to create a

278
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,350
corporation most aces really no
verification for you can just do it

279
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,329
online as long as you have a valid
credit card

280
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:27,529
you can become a you can incorporate and
that's not a problem for these guys

281
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,519
and there are so they'll create a few
hundred corporations in different states

282
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,089
than using fake ID status doesn't fake
ID's to establish merchant accounts

283
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,570
they will start charging each card went
from a from big preacher from a big but

284
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:40,930
net

285
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,100
just a few cents each and they will they
will make

286
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,800
ridiculous sums of money from this and
since it's just a few cents

287
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,220
the majority of the people are gonna
call for charge back to question some 50

288
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,980
cent charge or even a one dollar and
fifty Cent charge

289
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,420
and on this this kinda developed after
after while our cars were using

290
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,949
charities as checking services to check
the validity in the car to charge 25

291
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:03,420
cents fifty cents Tom

292
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,009
the throughout to a charity the card
works at a valid

293
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,459
they decide let's not you know that what
why give money to charity when he just

294
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:12,259
create

295
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,759
merchant accounts and and start getting
the money in

296
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,690
they've they made about 10 million bucks
on this one instance that the FTC was

297
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,990
able to pop in this is just one that the
area but find

298
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,290
and then there's also affiliate program
fraud which is also very popular

299
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,709
set up a Philly accounts Pay Per Click
Here resale Commission base pay per lead

300
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,139
any of those arm the set up a fake a a
fake ID info

301
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,870
farm for or real ones if they don't care
and arm

302
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,839
then just start using stolen cars to
purchase stuff and if it's did a product

303
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,120
like a

304
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,690
he book or something or from there's a
case where people a group of people

305
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,000
California uploaded their own song
Titans and use the whole bunch stolen

306
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,240
credit cards to download it over and
over again

307
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,790
but they they got caught because it was
they put the real in for their stupid

308
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,079
Ando and then there you can also um

309
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,769
the is also use for for pay per click
fraud where you can take all the

310
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,059
infected oMG thats

311
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,829
and that's a %uh and I think about these
about this new spot in the spy about it

312
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,198
every infected machine becomes a socks5
proxy

313
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,809
and they get a list love socks %uh all
the infected machines are currently

314
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:15,678
online

315
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,039
so each one of those you can bounce
through to do whatever you want and I'll

316
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,419
be by region so

317
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,839
if you wanna commit for a if you wanna
rip-off the US Merchant

318
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,168
you use a US proxy and do what you need
to do

319
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:30,429
and there are and you get less of
thousands and I

320
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:34,240
a chain those up and they'll use it for
pay per click fraud denial service a

321
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,140
anything like that

322
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,669
and then the the most popular one and
whereas

323
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:43,570
we saw the mule software is fraudulent
wire transfers

324
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,820
and arm with the there they'll use

325
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,899
any Creek any doesn't just have to be a
bank could be any

326
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,570
a any account that you can find it could
be a gambling account bank account

327
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,710
affiliate account

328
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,910
I love pre much anything that you've
send money and it finds it if they get

329
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,679
the credentials

330
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,870
they will attempt to withdraw

331
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,230
and how is this done arm they are

332
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,980
they through the use of new accounts is
a is a popular one

333
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,360
arm that there's some sure have I'm
alive you've seen spam you work from

334
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,049
home

335
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,650
cover payroll consultant in a human
resources from your house

336
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,679
and %uh basically it'll be someone with
a a bunch of stolen banking credits and

337
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,130
they need

338
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,830
they need someone to go and open up
checking accounts at the wire the money

339
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,689
into it

340
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,200
and it keeps LV and then for iraq and a
lot of Amer

341
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,730
are just people who are getting scammed
from you know they they're really

342
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,880
thinking they're working from home

343
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,100
they answered a Craigslist ad or
something and then there's other people

344
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,929
who are they

345
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,410
there in on it they know it's up in
these fake ID's or they'll just

346
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,900
though just say these are real F one
black guy I responded to an ad on

347
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,780
Craigslist I

348
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,990
I had no idea and armed sure at times me
or him your arrangements will be there

349
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,030
like 50 50 or 60 40

350
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,500
so those the wire in ten thousand
dollars stolen money from a method is a

351
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,780
once that once the money's been bounced
around

352
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,178
arm there it usually ends up appeared
ready cash tower in a digital

353
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,760
it a profitable that languish in a
digital currency account

354
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,799
and before back in the early 2000's it
was

355
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,160
e-gold they're based in and palm beach
county in Florida

356
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,500
a secret service rated them because
they're being used for laundering by the

357
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,679
people who did the TJX preach

358
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:23,970
and then our after that everyone can
move to Wed money which is basically

359
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,580
like a Russian Pay Pal

360
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,799
and it has a very very little controls
and you can

361
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,020
you used to be able to move a huge sums
of money

362
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,700
instantly for very little fees are
russia has

363
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,289
implemented a lot of financial controls
now you know they have their own

364
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:43,200
similar Patriot Act legislation over
there and it's caused a lot of arm and

365
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,870
it's cause a lot of rosters to move from
where money to Liberty Reserve

366
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,990
and Liberty Reserve is a a Costa Rican
digital currency

367
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,460
account arm you can it's as easy to
setup an account

368
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,919
with delivery service deal with the
freemen hotmail yahoo or something like

369
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:57,480

money from their accounts

374
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:12,530
send a money order send or just sent a
wire transfer directly into the Liberty

375
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,780
Reserve account

376
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,870
and arm it's a its use because it's
anonymous they really don't

377
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,289
the pride ourselves on the anonymity arm
its use for legitimately for a lot forex

378
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:22,919
trading

379
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,039
and I'm some some online gambling

380
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,780
combine to others it's very popular for
in the fraud market because of how easy

381
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,840
it is to use

382
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,970
and usually the first one in the final
stages

383
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,010
I love the cash out is the transfer from
DePuy a counter the Digi

384
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,010
diddle currency account into a prepaid
debit card and arm there's

385
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,158
there's different levels of risk
involved to how this is done

386
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,500
arm the a lot a lot of people who get
caught will do it the

387
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,830
the quickest way though the have good
deal have banking credit so have

388
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,990
access to though have access to an
account with money

389
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,919
and they'll just quick lead as fast they
can transfer everything they can to a

390
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,480
series a prepaid debit cards

391
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,799
and the start pulling money out arm if
but

392
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,610
you cameras ready TMC are you have to
walk in a place you walk out this time

393
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,390
stamps

394
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,929
there's a there's a lotta ways to get
caught doing that especially when they

395
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,320
see the destination

396
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,980
love feels okay this came from known cop
mice count and it's going to

397
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,520
a prepaid debit card you know unknown
routing number that's that

398
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,700
Hamas prepaid debit so loud when we get
frozen

399
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,380
or they're just straight get arrested
and Om

400
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,600
then or you can also bounce it through
the meals

401
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,990
you have a you have I'm your man you
have them to the Centerville County have

402
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,230
them send it to the prepaid debit
account

403
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,570
and on that's the you know that's less
risk other is let less chance to the

404
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,820
fund you gonna get frozen and the person
is getting

405
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,230
angry knock at the door will be the mule
first and on then there's you can also

406
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,490
browse through a series of meals and

407
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,850
different currencies and just build up
the layers and may make the

408
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,980
the trail much more difficult follow but
in the end there always is a money trail

409
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,250
arm in the united states they will
follow that money trail arm they will

410
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,150
follow it to the

411
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,190
you know to your door for United States
if but if you're in arm

412
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,330
the ukraine or urine Eastern Europe
somewhere

413
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,830
I if there's no real agreements between

414
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,949
the the US government and that
government it can be very very difficult

415
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,360
to enforce our

416
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,320
to enforce laws that prevent this and
almond also

417
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,490
guess you dumb from prepaid debit card
you don't even need to pull have an ATM

418
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,880
you can also initiate answers

419
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,600
at a prepaid debit account so you can
just have it wired to a Western Union

420
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,020
and I'm so there's display methods to to
actually get that done

421
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,720
and out again some diplomats itself %uh
money laundering in cash out

422
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,770
take direct from stone account drop it
to a prepaid card cash at an ATM

423
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,158
take it from an account drop it to a
mule and have them

424
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,880
for the money out and physically send
you half and that's what that's what a

425
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,870
lot of people

426
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,840
and in Eastern Europe and Russia will do
they want they won't deal with a

427
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,908
II any other love the digital stuff in
they might pay their mules

428
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:04,340
and preloaded prepaid debit cards but
they'll just want

429
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,490
cash sent to their drop because it's the
easiest and safest way

430
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,309
and arm and then and then again you have

431
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,280
your again pricing at through several
mules several digital currency accounts

432
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,000
and cashing out the prepaid card

433
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,140
and arm again don't try any of this

434
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,640
you will go to jail there they take it
very seriously in the United States

435
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,059
arm that their very heavy handed with
their sentencing here

436
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,280
arm and more and more they're more
international task force is being for

437
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,470
mister to combat this type of stuff

438
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,900
I just an example the heavy-handed
tactics Soup Nazi the guided the TJX

439
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,679
reach

440
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,400
twenty years and US federal prison I
want the people he worked with

441
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,039
got thirty years in a Turkish prison for
doing transfers at a at a bank

442
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:54,120
at a bank account in Turkey he didn't
even live in Turkey he he he was passing

443
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,470
through he was flying

444
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,100
to vacation somewhere and there's a stop
in Turkey and since he was known to them

445
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,279
they picked them up and a nap and let
him go for the next 30 years

446
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,460
may thats yeah its there is a Turkish
prison

447
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,720
I am mitigation arm

448
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,770
and these these techniques they're going
to continue

449
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,799
arm there's a it's very difficult to
stop them the only thing you can really

450
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,400
do is make yourself a less attractive

use no script for you know sometimes you
need web sites that need

458
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,980
the need to have JavaScript so you can
whitelist amor for most part

459

just keep no script always running
armies ad blocker

460
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,140
were a real common thing to do is um if

a malicious iframe from a program just
buy up some advertisements and

462
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:06,830
here's here's my add you just give them
the the malicious code in

463
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,020
on bail to be in bed into an image or
something and then I'll just be served

464
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,039
up on legitimate web site so you can
visit my space dot com in

465
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,500
they have a deal with an ad network that
pushes an ad through and

466
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,360
no one has any idea is malicious code
mean right and you just hittin people on

467
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,779
on MySpace and that happen myspace was
delivering a malicious act flames

468
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,510
erupted advertisements are a few years
ago and

469
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,860
it it continues on arm also are

470
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,000
PDF files a there's a Adobe causative
feature

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,400
by you're able to I that has the
business support JavaScript

472
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,919
and embedded executables and a PDF file
and

473
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,289
you're able to change the text on

474
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,100
the when you when you compare to an
executable MPFI when you open up

475
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,320
it'll tell you are ill tell you warning
there's an executable in here are you

476
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,470
sure you want to run it

477
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,130
are you can protect the PDF and change
that to say

478
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,679
this is a copyrighted PDF file are you
sure you you must accept the agreement

479
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,250
nor did I read the

480
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,610
you're in order to read this document
analysis and you you can hit

481
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,500
and thats arm that's just what I guess
it's cast social engineering with the

482
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,220
PDF

483
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,440
but then all the time is always no new
experts come after PF so just

484
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,429
by having it load within your browser
it'll you execute permission your

485
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:20,480
browser and then

486
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,870
and then you get hit and I'm job
applicants that's kind of like a fails

487
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,220
like when when the when an exploit kit

488
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,590
can't hit you will see have a patch
browser you have our

489

everything and

556
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,460
and send it out and %uh some great
resources

557
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,059
are the ER the Mauer intelligence block
this is an argentinian Groupon they do

558
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,389
some very very good work they are the
archive phishing pages

559
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,309
they are the did have all sorts of white
papers on different now our tools

560
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:11,658
arm there and even

561
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:15,559
after that malware and dot com MA W

562
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,379
maal WKR the I N T dot com

563
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,659
arm they have a an interview with the
author of spy on their into they say

564
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:27,799
it's very interesting interview and then
there's also the malware domain list

565
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:31,270
which lists up your L's have known
exploits

566
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,370
and no next week it's and arm the

567
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:39,210
and no nitrogen command control centers
and the zoo's tracker which are specific

568
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,539
routes

569
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,770
does the same thing as an hour domain
less but has it specifically

570
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:47,080
for z/os and each the swipes ice them
doin this is tracker

571
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,520
they'll have arm lists data CSV files
are you can just export

572
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,279
and at your firewall rules so any any
website that's listed

573
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:58,340
in these are on these web sites are you
can set it up so thatin

574
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,580
not know computer on you never could be
able to connect them so

575
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,350
that helps but it's not gonna prevent
any new ones unless you keep urself

576
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,360
regularly updated with their updates and
arm

577
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,360
that is a that is I guess I'll take
questions

578
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:30,970
arm

579
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,530
they were they were listed in the zoo's
tracker and on our two main list and a

580
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,580
lot of times guys putting these together

581
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,350
on their not very skilled they don't
follow proper configuration practices

582
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,840
they don't they don't really know what
they're doing of time to just pay

583
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,880
someone to set it up

584
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,770
so just be a standard web application
vulnerability analysis you couldn't get

585
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,760
into a good portion of

586
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,169
yes a lot of them are like that then

587
00:31:54,169 --> 00:32:01,169
and additional our abilities as well are
many a question yes

588
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,990
yet yes other

589
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,270
yes they are the builders for spy and
the new version of Zeus

590
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,460
they have licensing on it there they'll
dole license the builder

591
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,680
to the to your machine and they'll set
up like okay

592
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,800
the yours yours yours is ongoing work on
your machine

593
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,820
and if if the operator to serve in
someone ripped it with what

594
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,050
we're hoping it gets cracked eventually
by arm did

595
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,399
though you won't be able use a builder
and this is particularly license to you

596
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:43,400
and up League got

597
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,540
the %uh the zoo's tracker are made it

598
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,050
has list of countries where the where
the servers are held on the majority of

599
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,659
them are

600
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,230
in eastern europe in China but there's a
a lot apps use

601
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,660
arm servers being hosted in the United
States as well and they'll

602
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,820
the law they get taken down when they
discovered but they're

603
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,149
they're popping up every single day arm
though

604
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,880
both both still compromise web sites in
tournament as you so send the law and

605
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,340
the law also just buy

606
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,950
some hosting and hope that it stays
under the radar until they until he gets

607
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:22,950
too big

608
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,860
yes yes to a lot of the arm

609
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,310
the the spy authored a does speak
English and I'm he

610
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,030
the they be I'm not sure if there's a
Russian spy thing might only be English

611
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,730
but on on Zeus there has two settings
you can either set it to display in

612
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,230
Russian or display in English

613
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,770
on there's a the slot actors in europe
you use of who use the

614
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,820
the software and don't don't read
Russian but on the

615
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,189
the majority of the people doing it the
when when we look at the log files on

616
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,130
the compressors

617
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,810
there there there is coming from Eastern
Europe and Russia but they could be

618
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,010
using proxies to if they're smart they
are

619
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:08,010
yes arm

620
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,399
I not a farm if the list on our domain
list ties into

621
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,668
to Open DNS arm I'm I'm

622
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:21,500
I'm not I'm not exactly nizar sure about
the details that they have on them our

623
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,389
two main list on the the primary
function in-os are you can you can

624
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,560
export the list and add it to your
firewall rule said

625
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,659
my I don't know the specifics on the
Open DNS stuff up

626
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:38,659
yet you have over

627
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,000
yes that the the writers your I'll

628
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,040
or objects using that the the are just
about the people using it now being very

629
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,819
sophisticated but that the Trojans
themselves are very very sophisticated

630
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:00,099
the

631
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,150
the authors of the have the Trojans and

632
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,440
kits they're they're very skilled Aden
there they know exactly what they're

633
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:06,859
doing

634
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:10,900
and arm but there they're not really
using it themselves because they can

635
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,800
make much more money selling it air

636
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,819
very high prices to people who who they
don't have the skill to write it

637
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:21,119
but they can navigate a your point click
goin to face

638
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,280
and that those those are mainly the
people who are using it

639
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,940
that the authors are just kinda
developing the code and then selling it

640
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,280
and those guys those guys are very good
and for that the Zeus

641
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,109
this group is a is a Russian group but
they've been arm the disease has been

642
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:38,980
the compound and then rebuilt so it
there are many different variants and a

643
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,980
there are but this primarily Eastern
Europe and Russia and

644
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,390
the authors are very very skilled
absolutely yes

645
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,828
I'm

646
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:54,740
its it is well the in the United States
it is by

647
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,230
if the authors are you it alarm times
are in make rusher Ukrainian

648
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,359
its in those places narrowly illegal to

649
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:06,130
to develop the coldest the by can be
illegal to spread it

650
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,130
so there or to sell it by its there are

651
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,520
there then there the the authors are
tracked by

652
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,060
they haven't caught to peddle a
anti-u_n_

653
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:23,060
area

654
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,660
on that's there there are there are
people working on doing that dr.

655
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,719
it is just that center comes out on on
port eighty it it did

656
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,809
some the unless you're looking for just

657
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:45,489
your straight rc4 traffic by its is just
gonna look like

658
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:52,489
gibberish so how you specify that and

659
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:03,670
I not that I know of not yet not
specifically for those use Trojan arm

660
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,970
the flash a is asking a farm the

661
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,640
the PDF files from our are vulnerable if
there any other file formats that are

662
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,100
vulnerable like that a

663
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,850
the flash arm approach Adobe products
are very vulnerable

664
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,000
I yes anally yes

665
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
yes

666
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,220
a arm may be on the new one if changed
it I'm not sure

667
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,080
on but definitely on your own it it's at
standard to standard beacon

668
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,480
every 25 minutes yes oh yeah are you can
you can you can configure in

669
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,970
but it will still stay arm air stay
consistent

670
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:58,970
yes

671
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,620
other it's mostly detection arm

672
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,370
the that section of the payload on our
by antivirus is that the the older

673
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,750
versions for that are cheap on their
gonna have to be detected by lot more

674
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,590
Antivirus is

675
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,770
and the the newer ones are they'll you
sometimes a hundred percent

676
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:24,770
I detection rate yes

677
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,530
yes it hooks in arm the it's definitely
hook center for the majority the

678
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,700
the older versions only cook Internet
Explorer

679
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,910
but the newer ones have Firefox will
also work Firefox as well

680
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,339
arm its from I'm

681
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:49,700
I'm sure someone's develop the plugin
for it by now but I haven't seen

682
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:56,700
if up yes yes they they

683
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,270
they'll try to the destroyed try to
secure your servers and stuff by Tom

684
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,980
that

685
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,930
00 yes actually yes if if you try to go
to if you try to hit an exploit kit with

686
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,319
with the bone to or something like that
a lot I just directly rebut redirect

687
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,890
Google

688
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,348
or are more to show a blank page in
wanna tend to do anything that is the

689
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:22,580
wrong user agent it does detect use a
region

690
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:29,580
yes

691
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:38,850
okay

692
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,560
up it's almost he say yeah he has a a
physical hardware device that uses when

693
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,790
he logged into his back out

694
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,250
and on it it would that mitigated I if

695
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,080
if the weather application has poor
session handling then

696
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,390
then yeah I won't help could you can
just you can just grab the cookin jump

697
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,100
on the session

698
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:01,710
I'll

699
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,210
with that you allow that would be arm
the

700
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,940
now would be with those additional
fields that are be injected for to try

701
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,500
to trick you to relay information

702
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,670
that yes

703
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:19,370
purposes huh

704
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,540
of

705
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,670
brought I

706
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,790
as

707
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,820
to visit I would say most free porn

708
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:33,160
job you're probably get hit if

709
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,029
huh her her

710
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,230
who this is to any other questions that

711
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:48,230
yes the Mac are it

712
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,400
it it can yeah it'd

713
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,010
again if it if it's being hit with an
exploit like an exploit kit

714
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,590
it's not really going to help much but
if for you no love for just someone is

715
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,050
picking up a USB Drive and stick it in
the machine

716
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,120
it it might help arm by at four

717
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,620
for the majority of drive-by drive-by
download exploits that the whole point

718
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,220
is they want to get to a system
permission to administer information

719
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,590
before leaving for the executable

720
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,380
that that's what the exploits for and

721
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,730
any other questions up yes there's

722
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,950
there have been we have seen our OSX

723
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:31,160
exploits on exploit kits om the they
weren't served there they weren't

724
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,690
serving up any payloads for it

725
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,880
are but there are no there there are Mac
but net

726
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,150
arm software just from several years ago
and I am service active anymore but

727
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,250
there's one Scott Mac by

728
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,260
and on that that I that existed and I'm
I'm

729
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,440
I haven't come across any arm I have
seen exploits for OS X for next week

730
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,990
it's perhaps a payload for

731
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,210
only

732
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,700
a anymore okay I guess amp up

733
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:03,700
yes

734
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,920
now

735
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,860
yet that's about it just monitor arm
monitoring your

736
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,960
well if for older versions you can
checked

737
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,960
your windows system32 directory arm

738
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,350
there should be if there's a hidden
directory called percent low sec

739
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,120
percent you're infected an invite but
that's not that's

740
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,450
that's only one very nervous use and the
new ones world will change around in

741
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,930
on the news use 2.0 it will on a

742
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,730
each payload will have a new md5 hash so

743
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,230
people trying to take the payload and
match which campaigns are from which

744
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,550
they can't do that was used to because
all the payload md5 hashes are changing

745
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:52,550
yes yes %uh fast flux domain

746
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,400
did zoos zoos tracker arm tracks fast
flux to meet said that though actually

747
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,850
on the color code I'm so you'll see like
a blue like this on Facebook so may not

748
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,210
be here and then we find again the post
a backup

749
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,240
so-so Zeus will track them are not sure
about an hour to me mister

750
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,300
a the questions take

751
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,250
can see okay arm s arm that song thank
you

752
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:27,570
