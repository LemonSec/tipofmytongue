1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,960
please don't take this as we would last
and I'm Chris for many

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,700
you can reach me at present the idea
that we're follow me

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,099
got fun Twitter I have a computer
science degree from the University of

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,880
Southern Maine which is where I met
Tiffany

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,570
and I'm currently suffering in iraq
Craigslist uttered

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,900
although I have to say that the stock
may not reflect Craigslist views

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,900
I am also the current acting executive
director

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,679
project DOD which the 501 c3 non-profit
organization

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,710
and most to the abuse case examples that
we're going to be today come

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,129
by way of that lastly if you guys read

11
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,399
Def Con last year in any view attended
the subverting the world were craft AP I

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,770
cock that was me its it was

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,520
when we're up I think than this stock
and I'm like a lot a legal types that

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,860
i've seen. I'm not going to read you the
whole the MCA

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,629
I'm not gonna talk statute but I will
brief you beef we tell you about the

16
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:55,949
with the

17
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,839
DMCA is it's the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act it's being used in ways

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,500
that I don't think the drafters intended
to

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,890
for to be used its gills brief if sorry
free speech disclosure and security

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,900
vulnerabilities innovative research

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,619
and the ACTA is something that is in
town it is in fact it has not been

22
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:13,350
passed

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,200
but to if the countries that are going
possibly if this doesn't happen and that

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,640
could be affected by ACTA

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,840
will have chilling effects Murray the
United States so it's important to mourn

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,770
reasons we're talking about this is if I
should tell your mom acres

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,939
if you're not thrilled about the ACTA
now before round before it is passed

28
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,350
Arabian on what we're going to do is let
me give you some hypothetical examples

29
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,590
and to them were gonna ask you on is
this factor is it fiction can this

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,420
really happen

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,030
the first thing here and how the DMCA
affects

32
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,700
you if you have a company but they are
the software company and

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,579
you're gonna watch a product it's really
big for your company someone else

34
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,840
as happens often when you have
innovative products have something

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
that's almost exactly like yours but not
exactly

36
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,079
on your company's quick you wanna be
first to market because those are their

37
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,990
first to market

38
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,409
are usually at has have the best market
advantage however

39
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,490
you just discover that your ISP has been
flooded with DMCA takedown notices

40
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,959
about your software you about your
source code on

41
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,660
what happens most if not all other
companies that is removed by your ISP

42
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,250
and the day you planned for launch you
have no woman presents

43
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,360
and if you're an online computer company
that's a big deal you miss being first

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,950
to market

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,709
silencing discussion of security
vulnerabilities as when I know a lot of

46
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,629
people in this room are familiar with
and

47
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,768
something that is important it's me
Chris we discuss these things but

48
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,720
but say in this hypothetical your
security researcher you are in all the

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,680
holiday stuff

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,680
and you have a vulnerability disclosure
and you're about to do the other day but

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,760
you hear someone else is doing something
somewhere you as often happens in this

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,530
community and no

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,129
and a slowdown the other researcher you
decide to file multiple

54
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:53,549
DMCA takedown notices to his ISP and you
let the ISP just figure out if they're

55
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,440
legitimate or not

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,849
so the results your competitors blog
social network accounts and his company

57
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:00,690
sites are down

58
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,470
you post your day does not chilling
online critique this is what's very key

59
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,090
to the case we're talking about today

60
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,300
you been injured by medical techniques
implemented by a physician

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,459
you would like further doctors and
patients to know how this harm to you

62
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,920
you want other people to research how to
make it better how this cannot happen to

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,670
other people

64
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,800
%uh so this doctor who perform this
medical technique on you has had

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,150
books has published books he's been on
TV broadcasts to

66
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,530
broadcast TV and you use proper fair use
techniques

67
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,440
citing references and you take a little
bit said his book and say this is the

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,819
problem here I I didn't agree with this
is how it hurt me

69
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,870
the result your login or critique
mentioning the doctor's name is offline

70
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,970
because your ISP

71
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,720
has so many takedown notices and that it
comes right down

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,909
on no one can discuss the on my negative
affects

73
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,489
that this doctor has some has caused so
here's the question and will answer it

74
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,720
toward the end is this fact or fiction

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,310
that's a good question alright here's
the little spiel about what this is with

76
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,049
the MCAS and I i look at two different
aspects with EMC and the research I do I

77
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,049
research on

78
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:08,330
week reverse engineering techniques
which as you know extremely difficult to

79
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,760
get right legally to get a rate for the
reverse engineering

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,659
if you work for a company to care very
much about the clean or dirty ones have

81
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,340
a technique

82
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,978
I'm so that's one aspect circumventing
enticer convention measures such as

83
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:22,190
breaking encryption to be able to look
at copywriter in Patna code which you

84
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,060
know is that I am

85
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,280
you it is something that you could look
up on us. PTO say now this on the other

86
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,509
hand we're talking about on in this case

87
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,229
a about to about DMCA takedown notices
for Capri

88
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,349
copyright on infringement alleged
copyright infringement but this was

89
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,380
signed into law by President Clinton in
1998

90
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,810
this is a staggering manner a percentage
that we had here but 37 percent and you

91
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,949
see taken in this is

92
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,509
are invalid on Google made a submission
to

93
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,979
New Zealand was looking at grad drafting
some laws similar to the DMCA

94
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,190
and cool decided that they were going to
take a stand it takes say something

95
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,100
about it

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,699
what's amazing is 57 percent these
invalid takedown notices

97
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,490
were filed by businesses targeting
competitors so this is being used as

98
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,020
cover

99
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,620
offenses market technique

100
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,550
okay here's the the ACTA if sure you've
heard about it but what's interesting

101
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,229
about the ACTA is not a lot of people
know about it

102
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,889
it was only go seated behind closed
doors in by President Obama and

103
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,160
DEA this is something that isn't doesn't
have enough discussion the public as I

104
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,300
think it should

105
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,990
on this is a an intellectual property
the type of organization that

106
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,509
outside if any other countries
jurisdiction its own thing on outside of

107
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,110
waco wtoo

108
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,470
and some the things that are very
interesting about this there the bottom

109
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,949
it is increases searches

110
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,070
on at the border and vague

111
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,120
the communication between different law
enforcement group is going to be

112
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,880
big heightened for that as well but it
addresses are the reason that all these

113
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,639
countries are going together is a

114
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,080
a

115
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,990
they say that to intellectual property
infringement is on the rise in a

116
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,599
nationally

117
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,259
so they're trying to get something and
switch all the company our countries

118
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:55,780
agree

119
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,639
but it was but in originally for like
people making like fake Gucci purses

120
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,110
whatever is going on in China

121
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,430
but it also extends a generic medicines
which can be dangerous if and only if

122
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,129
those are not to from the

123
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:10,900
company Flickr from an online copyright
infringement such as music and suffer

124
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,639
on propose party to the ACTA

125
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,389
get here they are and were United States
is up there as well and

126
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,750
if you go to the eurozone's gonna be in
our slide you can look at the recent

127
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,599
drop that was prepared this is the most
recent have been able to find online

128
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,190
before the stuff was leaked which was on
this is one that was actually prepared

129
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,319
for public release

130
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,520
on but the weeks with the only you ways
that we were able to figure out what the

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,830
acti it was and what is going on with it
because there really was no public

132
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,650
discussion

133
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,129
%uh so a couple notes about the talk

134
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:44,680
there are different types my skis from
to try and clarify

135
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,370
what we're talking about I'm we're not
talking about the last mile Internet

136
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,360
Service Provider the

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
the one that gives you access the
internet the ice he's really talking

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,449
about in this

139
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,550
look a lot more like hosting providers
Facebook

140
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,750
Twitter Google and

141
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,370
mosser questions a rhetorical that's
further its marketing

142
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,580
dance %uh so

143
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,599
why is the stock relevant the DMC has
been around for 10 years well

144
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,110
in in our observations a project DOD

145
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,490
abuse is on the rise so in the last two
or three years we've seen

146
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,479
lots and lots abusers flame corporate
hosting providers because

147
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,930
they were kicked off without the ability
to file a counter notice and it's also

148
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,319
extremely relevant

149
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,539
because there's a bunch of other
legislation and different countries

150
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,128
like canada as the c32 others the
digital economy bill in the UK and of

151
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,080
course the CTA

152
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,449
which Tiffany just talked about I love
these have take down provisions

153
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,330
and it seems like the activist community
out there that's trying to stop things

154
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:45,659
is

155
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:49,180
is not as much focused on that take them
provision as they are about things like

156
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,069
that's the locks

157
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,159
and we've we wanna see if we can at
least

158
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,849
make the community aware that these
things are a problem

159
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:00,729
going forward looks from her action

160
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,060
%uh so who is project DOD well

161
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,550
it's a a volunteer-run by 23 terrible
nonprofit

162
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,169
so there's no employees but it looks a
lot more like an open source development

163
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:11,839
project

164
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,690
which I'm sure when you guys are
familiar with it's also funded by

165
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,699
donations

166
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,930
its its biggest projects right now is

167
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,969
a housing project that started about 12
years ago originally a providing

168
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:27,500
hosting services to the needy in the
impoverished back on this was really

169
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,130
expensive

170
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,370
over the years hosting became more for
commodity and

171
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,349
as it did the margins for profit for
normal hosting account started to

172
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,370
to get thinner and thinner and so all of
the content that was a bit troublesome

173
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,089
wanna being kicked off above ISP's
because they don't want to deal with

174
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,690
that there wasn't enough profit involved

175
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,079
I and so we've slowly over the years
gravitated towards this

176
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,440
censorship resistant hosting model ants

177
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,050
as a now a bunch of us are working on
trying to build

178
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,109
censorship resistant service
infrastructure that

179
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,459
uses jurisdiction of interpreting some
the problems that we're gonna talk about

180
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,250
a stock

181
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,949
I'm also gonna know that Chris and I are
here on behalf a project DOD

182
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,449
I'm pro bono attorney for project your
day and I have been for a few years and

183
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:16,630
I chris is a developer founder at-at

184
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,100
on and what we're here to talk about
this is the case that got us

185
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,860
said real actively involved and I'm not
talking about censorship in

186
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,130
really addressing issues such as a liked
or hidden services

187
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,589
is this case its project DOD versus
Federici

188
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:34,110
on we're gonna talk about the DMCA
takedown abuses

189
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,370
IT departments do not wanna handled the
floods love

190
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,920
I O takedown notices they're getting and
with that high percentage of 37 percent

191
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,250
of them

192
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,810
as it turns out turning to Google being
I invalid that's a lotta stuff for them

193
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,380
to sift through

194
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,730
see what's what's actual copyright
infringement which is what's just wanna

195
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,329
silence and critique online

196
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:54,860
on what's been great about this case and
one other reasons that we call this a

197
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,769
vehicle case in law and on that we're
hoping that it will be

198
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:02,170
is that to this case is not just about
like copyright infringement like

199
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,000
you copied like twelve different peoples
works and put it in your book and just

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,380
published it with your name on it

201
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,550
this is different this is the case in
which John this is about talking about

202
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,680
medic medicine science you know
discussing things that are important for

203
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,550
innovation for making things better

204
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,350
were not able to do that because of all
the takedown notices our clients gotten

205
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,949
so we're trying to find check
technological workarounds because some

206
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,870
we've reached a bit over a what a
boundary how far we can take it with the

207
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,490
law

208
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,559
we've had great help from the Electronic
Frontier Foundation chronic sorry there

209
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,990
has been a great adviser to us

210
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,449
on on this project and so have a couple
attorneys in Portland Maine because

211
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,430
that's where we started with our
jurisdiction

212
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,650
on that they were yeah they're they're
great sound

213
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,490
procedural type attorneys okay to
questions we have is them

214
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,189
if I medicine is based on science was
the first site at the peer review

215
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:51,550
process is censored

216
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,089
you can talk about hey I don't like this
process in my purse this procedure or

217
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:55,569
haters

218
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:58,760
security vulnerability I'd really like
to discuss this on

219
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,240
that's gonna me how that's gonna be
pretty chilling for speech and open

220
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,069
discussion

221
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:06,740
is an able to happen we're not gonna be
able to make things better

222
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,029
some prefer going to get a little
background on on

223
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,100
the dispute between Federici and this
group advocates for children there

224
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,230
but it'll just be fast us that we can
get to the point where they fameFlynet

225
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,829
joining DOD

226
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,699
so Federici is an alleged attachment
therapist

227
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:27,160
and basically he has a proposed
treatment for something called a

228
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,699
reactive attachment disorder

229
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,939
%uh and the treatment as a circle
holding therapy

230
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,170
that

231
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,390
looks like you know you basically
restrain the child my opinion against

232
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:36,949
their will

233
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,399
and a at some point they break down and
the theory is that the reform a bond

234
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,720
that they can form in there

235
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
younger so advocates for children in
therapy

236
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,110
is this group trying to stop this
practice they

237
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,160
say it's tantamount to torture ands and
so they've been fighting this

238
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,420
actively for years and years its to give
you guys some contacts that have you

239
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,339
ever seen a law and order episode about

240
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,149
this girl that was smothered in a
blanket during some weird rebirth in

241
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:05,760
process

242
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,920
so bad is based on %uh

243
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,219
loosely based on this case with Candace
maker which is a

244
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,300
a young girl that was killed as a result
of this there

245
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,529
so Federici

246
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:23,310
basically legally engaged advocates for
children in therapy for libel and

247
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,630
slander years and years ago before they
ever got us

248
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,050
and so advocates for children there to
restructure their page

249
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,220
to to basically

250
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,380
allow people to draw their own
conclusions and its and

251
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,130
the reason they did that is because
truth is that protection against libel

252
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,950
and slander

253
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,660
and so I wanna give an example of what
the restructured page looks like

254
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,810
and feel you'll see here that

255
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,150
a basically you have a said a quotes and
you have a citation down at the bottom

256
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,319
a with page number the puppets and
another set a quotes

257
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,310
and page number and the book that it
came from

258
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,390
no those of us that went to school a
certainly know that this is what we were

259
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,860
taught to do when we put things

260
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,950
and I think that this is clearly

261
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,150
fair use Sep so

262
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,560
enter the DMCA nasa Federici says oh a

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,630
well this is Mike operate so I'm gonna
send DMCA takedown notices for it

264
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,300
and he files from DMCA takedown notices
for the nonpartisan shop for advocates

265
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,209
for children therapy

266
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:29,540
and advocates for chillin thirties
kicked off immediately without the

267
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,390
ability to file a counter notice

268
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,760
and as a result the mood to network
solutions well Federici files a takedown

269
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,029
notice to network solutions

270
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,910
and what is network solutions do they
also do not allow them to file a counter

271
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,410
notice

272
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,680
bed remember this is the this is the
content

273
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,510
right so a so they wind up

274
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,700
leaving evert solutions and finding

275
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,970
project DOD andrew here's the procedure:
about the stuff that we had to go

276
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,980
through I mean a couple other proton
attorneys were very busy with

277
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,820
counterclaims

278
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,450
on so %uh Federici files takedown notice
and the whole site

279
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,610
is requested to come down I'm we allow
for counter notice

280
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,350
on the contents down for 10 business
days and we'll talk about and talk about

281
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,860
this 10 business days

282
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,270
is pretty much time out to a denial of
service attack if you just keep

283
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,800
filing these takedown notices over and
over again for the exact same content

284
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,620
%ah the content comes back up after the
10 days

285
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,829
upstream provider gets harassed BFF
steps in the back the provider

286
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:28,610
which was fantastic and they they were
okay with that and Federici has a

287
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,020
other doctors ascend the same takedown
notices a doctor's waiting psychologists

288
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,490
at that type a medical professional

289
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,480
for the same pages for for three months
and portions of that site are down so

290
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,449
during a long period of time you know
sites went down our parts a bit so it

291
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,150
the up and down time was really
disruptive for the clients

292
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:50,329
yeah and this is also BISP in this case
project DOD can maintain it safe harbor

293
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,810
I so wanted to point out that are big
contract are big contribution to

294
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,920
censorship resistant as

295
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,199
research resistance is number two appear
which is simply that we allowed to be

296
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,130
counter notice procedures to happen

297
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,959
none of the other ISP's appear to be
doing this now so six months go by we

298
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:06,820
don't hear anything

299
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,040
better she has a tree file a takedown
notice for the same content

300
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,640
exactly the same content we use on
05/01/12 the sub Federici

301
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,270
and five intro 12 is about like
misrepresentation copyright you're not

302
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,600
supposed to be able to just

303
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,740
file of El mom yours was be able to file
of a sudden you see a takedown notices

304
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,390
say it comes down I don't care

305
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,500
what'd is you know you've just take it
down but on if we can catch under 5

306
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,079
1/2-hour

307
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,810
f we can get attorney attorney fees paid
for which is what we were all hoping for

308
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,690
home so arguments are made main and may
dismiss for lack of personal

309
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,600
jurisdiction

310
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,380
that's a whole nother another issue but
some Federici files another DMCA

311
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,630
takedown it was the third one for the
same element and we are pursuing this

312
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,390
senate Federation Virginia

313
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,610
okay and one thing to to mention that
the DMCA when Chris mention the safe

314
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,270
harbor

315
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,160
aunt was talking about for the safe
harbor means for an ISP %uh

316
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,319
yessir I'm so basically the safe harbor
is that

317
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,670
well I guess effort for ISPs for the
entire point

318
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,790
love be taken a provision and in fact
take them provision and all these other

319
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,010
pieces the legislation

320
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,910
is that they tied this disinterested
third party the ISP but I B

321
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,250
liability to the content that these are
hosts as a contributory infringer

322
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,459
so it basically yep

323
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,520
check if if the ISP does wants to waive

324
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,610
they I'm safe harbor provisions which
project DOT has done multiple times we

325
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,699
just take it on a court instead

326
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,890
if we would lose that case on that we
could be contributory early on the label

327
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,630
for

328
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,530
for the damages on the I scheming a
project DOD

329
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,890
so coming abuses for DMC take em
provisions we've learned that fair use

330
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,020
is not a magic bullet

331
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,459
and not only is it not on but fair use
is difficult

332
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,770
um its its we found it is very difficult
defense for

333
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,760
for some other said but to statutory
waiting period

334
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,860
is a touch wood tile service attack and
back to take downs were

335
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,240
work on that is when I you just keep
going if you file lot

336
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,169
DMCA takedown notices all the way up the
stream for the ISP

337
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,600
if one doesn't do it you just keep going
all the way up and just really flooding

338
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,169
their IT departments with his takedown
notices

339
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:16,290
it's a and was changed tack that's what
we're we're experiencing right now

340
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,819
and leveraging 851 12 Canada's discover
one's identity is another thing that's

341
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,579
very tricky and in this case

342
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,550
on in this case the attorneys on
especially the female attorneys working

343
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,300
on this case

344
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,710
experience a lot of online harassment
and and we knew it was related to this

345
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,320
case because the postings were all about
to the psychologist that was meant to be

346
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,050
anonymous but

347
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,520
us some love that the trails have led it
to be not anonymous and we've we've

348
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,730
we found out some information about that
but so there's some

349
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,159
women who wanted to join in this suit
but they're afraid

350
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:50,110
they're afraid because up the harassment
and the libel that we're experiencing

351
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,659
online

352
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:55,190
so there are people who were interested
in joining the case but they're afraid

353
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,190
that their identity

354
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,750
is going to become public and that they
know have a lot on my body looks like a

355
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,240
summer the other we have had effort
representing

356
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,790
Downpatrick DOD and I ask is liability

357
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,480
mmm okay on the site

358
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,659
a provisional 05/01/12 we we briefly
mentioned a bit what's important with

359
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:20,720
this that's going on right now to FF is
on this case comments for says universal

360
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,700
which their it this is in the ninth
circuit in California and they're saying

361
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,000
that a fair use is a necessary element
for notification

362
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,110
meaning you have to you should every
stage another bid you should have to

363
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,540
consider fair use

364
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,639
when you file these these takedown
notices for right now that is not that

365
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,000
is not the case it's not happening like
at

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,030
fair use is hard to determine is one of
the M the issues that were having as

367
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,450
well

368
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,470
and there for fair use is hard to use a
defense against DMCA takedown notice

369
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,510
so and from our experience says its
don't try it it's it's not working as it

370
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,030
should

371
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,379
legally it should but it said we're
having a little trouble the courts with

372
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,100
this

373
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,230
and fibers well that is hard to use so
do we have a jurisdictional problem with

374
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,870
us as well

375
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,150
some examples that productivity's
experience with

376
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,530
clear violations are am sorry I clear
fair use and then

377
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,750
receiving DMCA takedown notices in 2005

378
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,120
we host at Walmart Ivan hyphen
foundation adored

379
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,620
and 700 I think loved adored these were
satires

380
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,820
political satires fee sites that they
were

381
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,809
they're spoofing they were made by a
couple art students at

382
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:27,490
at Carnegie Mellon University they were
taking a subversive media class

383
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,630
and other up on us for for about two
weeks

384
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,870
and them both both users receive

385
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,230
DMCA takedown notices 1 from Walmart one
from the Christian Broadcasting Network

386
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,970
and its and baby really struggled with
whether or not they want to file a

387
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,190
counter notice but they wound up not
doing it because they would have to

388
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,450
defend a fair use against other people
might up Walmart

389
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,490
and the 700 club and

390
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,860
clearly well as we've shown project
universe Federici

391
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,280
a is is also an abuse case a fair use
except that

392
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,500
the significance hears that we receive
those takedowns

393
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,559
after the lens versus universal finding
which

394
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,990
I don't say doesn't mean it doesn't have
as much teeth but I don't know if it's

395
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,659
changed the playing field as much

396
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,250
the statutory waiting period over is his
denial of service attack that's the way

397
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,620
we're looking at it it's a its
equivalent to that

398
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,860
a hundred see the counter notice to
maintain safe harbor we gotta take a

399
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,389
step down for 10 days

400
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:26,790
and that has been very difficult for
clients and for speech online

401
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,490
and so of course Federica case

402
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,560
he figured this out and he had a bunch
his colleagues

403
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,960
sand DMCA takedown notices for content
on the site

404
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,030
as the site talks about a bunch of
different people

405
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,470
and at the same sorta templated stuff
and so for different

406
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,450
so for over a period of like two or
three months different parts of their

407
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,669
site was down

408
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:52,690
as a result of this denial of service
attack nine thats 10

409
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,360
business days so I and maybe can argue a
business days

410
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,090
is everything but they have the week but
it may it may be defined as

411
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,699
as have a month at that point and and
mind you for some of the content that

412
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,010
was coming down user

413
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,149
people who have been 90 recovery group
from

414
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:11,669
be the whole down the the attachment
technique can also

415
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,810
parents whose children have had died or
been injured by this technique they're

416
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,230
not on

417
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,060
they haven't been able to you express
their their upstair there

418
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,178
there are concerned about these
techniques online because we kept kept

419
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:23,200
getting these out these

420
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,700
carries a time when it all came down um
so

421
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,830
their are better takedowns arm

422
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,158
I is another way that the DMCA can be
abuse this is that

423
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,360
I if we receive a DMCA takedown

424
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,740
and we decide we're gonna respond to in
lot a person a counter notice

425
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,909
I at any given point there's nothing in
the statute to prevent

426
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:47,450
someone from going to our upstream
provider and sending those people take

427
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,280
downs as well

428
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,500
so you know the defacto process out
there this

429
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,540
at this point is to do a Aaron lookup on
the IP address

430
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,889
and use the abuse information there in
order to

431
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:04,940
to contact the ISP and even some smaller
ISPs don't have

432
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,899
their abuse information registered in a
run for their ISP's

433
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:12,620
and so the real danger here it's sort of
like the danger in the late 90's that

434
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,960
media consolidation

435
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,899
guys that you have a couple large
providers that essentially starter

436
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:22,370
become the people that are on dictating
whether or not content stays up for

437
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,080
stays down on the Internet

438
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,550
in just a side note anybody that's
hosting virtual private server hosting

439
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,629
could be problematic since the content
resides on that

440
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,060
server so if you have a set of policies
they may

441
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,080
not matter since our upstream provider
is likely going to exercise

442
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,668
editorial control %uh so some examples
of these takedowns

443
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:47,300
that that we've seen a.m.

444
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,399
well it's a our last 12 years we have a
bunch on

445
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:54,280
but there's one that stands out and
we've been kicked off

446
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,790
tons and tons of providers as a result
of this the policy conflict

447
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,940
but we're on one provider that we were

448
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,669
collocated with an ISP who was on above
Metsos to

449
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:09,010
about Noah's Ark to hop up upstream
provider

450
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,158
II and we are hosting an oath some
unease cuz you guys know it had block is

451
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,649
hot but that are

452
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:18,710
some anyway it's a it's basically acting
for

453
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,100
and much the same way they like the
hacking spaces are

454
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,389
and they haven't seen the publish and a
we're talking about a person who is

455
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:27,200
trying to you

456
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,649
get their members turn into to jail and
so they

457
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:34,649
disclosed a buncha dialogue or
conversations from this guy

458
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:39,100
and and then a book that received a DMCA
takedown notice where

459
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,060
and told us we had to take it down but
did allow us to follow the process a

460
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,790
counter notice

461
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,350
and so the interesting thing is so weak
we told them okay take it down and what

462
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,950
they did is there a place near seen
their place the section with the

463
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,220
takedown notice which is pretty common
practice range I guess I'm taking down a

464
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,179
bit the takedown notice in its place

465
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:59,220
so that people can see that you're being
silence

466
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,550
well we then receives another DMCA
takedown notice

467
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,530
for the original DMCA takedown notice

468
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,830
%uh and and but but rather than about
that look at it and say oh well

469
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,408
this is clearly abuse if they actually
really

470
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,429
livid with us there like we're not gonna
play this whack-a-mole game I take it

471
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,780
offering to shut you off entirely

472
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,860
which would mean for transitive way that
they would shut every user that we host

473
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,360
of

474
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,669
all the domains that the house and

475
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,540
so today we have a much more functional
relationship with our upstream provider

476
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,500
in the prosecutor's Federici case

477
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,850
a silicon valley Weather Service here.
hosted with for that particular case

478
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,240
maintained their common carrier status

479
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,820
and this is because they're different
classifications for ISP's and one other

480
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,290
classifications is

481
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,800
is what we are where is where the
content resides in there's another

482
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,210
classification

483
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,000
which is the Cirque on carrier status
and they have no

484
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,010
there no obligation under the law to

485
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,350
to comply with the take down a counter
notice procedures

486
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,639
I am the FF stepped in to back up for
upstream provider even when the sky

487
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,620
really having

488
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,590
this is a and was chained attack in for
the a pro bono attorneys it's become

489
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,658
tiring

490
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:10,419
after the full process it's college
transfer appearance repeat it just keeps

491
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:11,040
happening

492
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,320
it's the same stuff comes on for 10 days
and is it takes a lot of time to make

493
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,310
sure that the new notices are indeed
noon

494
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,370
and if you ever heard your double
jeopardy

495
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,750
this is Lake come in like 20 Dec a
jeopardy or something every week we just

496
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,000
get the same stuff

497
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,669
again this happens in the ferry to case
of course I'm you know I'm just gonna

498
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:33,149
mention that it's it is really time
consuming because we lose our life I

499
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:34,669
mean we lose our safe harbor

500
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:38,060
if he just puts one thing in there
that's a little bit different

501
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,730
so it of course it takes it on a time I
think you guys are starting to get an

502
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,100
idea of why I S p's

503
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,460
don't want to follow the counter notice
procedures here other for-profit

504
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,490
organizations that

505
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,320
that dis can afford it or they probably
could but

506
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,889
and losing the safe harbor provisions is
a very big deal and four

507
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:59,200
project DOD this is one of the only
organizations I have ever seen that says

508
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,770
okay

509
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,820
you know bring it on burden on we're
gonna

510
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,210
say we don't want the safe harbor
provisions were gonna take you to court

511
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,250
it's expensive

512
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,789
especially don't have private attorneys
also leveraged

513
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:11,750
leveraging the fight went well gee
counter notice discover man's identity I

514
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,850
mention this ad before bed does some

515
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,409
this was a little bit unfair about this
and it's unfair because Connor known as

516
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,470
require personal identifying information

517
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,950
so and if you do get a DMCA takedown
notice this is why the ways that you can

518
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,779
do a counter notice without having hired
an attorney at least a

519
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:29,440
if you wanna take take care for herself
but a project at work under law school

520
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,890
is a chilling effect steady work and
that's run through Harvard Law School

521
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,120
and dead it was a they have actually you
put in some information about who's

522
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,390
sending you the takedown notice

523
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,720
it fills out the form for you and you
sign it and send it so

524
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,130
if you that's how you do account it is
said the takedown notices

525
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,570
well at that sunshine affects told her
that she can find us online if you

526
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:48,860
wanted

527
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,270
for how those but we're dealing with the
countess is here so they require

528
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,820
personal identifying information

529
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,600
for information but notice that the
takedown notices themselves don't

530
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,860
require this information

531
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,270
so ed its it's the kind of thing we do
if you wanna

532
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,620
reveal some your plans identities for
the ISP it's a problem

533
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,500
and the gross rADM ever at such if I
want our cars a court order to release

534
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,289
identity

535
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:13,480
so navigation for the FBI bar there

536
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,320
Fred on a

537
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,649
the the issuer up a takedown notice the
that the

538
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:24,990
alleged rape holder can file a

539
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,770
512 each request against the ISP and
order

540
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,570
in and they have to get their court
order by today to get the personal

541
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,178
identifying information about person

542
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:38,429
yet a counter notice doesn't require
that same

543
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,539
upper as sort of a loophole writes like
so anyway what we saw

544
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,510
this is an entirely separate case we
also host a doing called stop

545
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,940
child tortured Edward and these people

546
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,470
this is the same person Federici these
people have been kicked off other

547
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,919
providers they planted on us

548
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:57,980
at this point and stop sheltered outward

549
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,159
I basically was pointing out in NBC
video

550
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:04,649
that was made about this practice way
back in the day

551
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,309
hi and comparing sum up a takedown
techniques shown in the video

552
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:13,440
with this face-down takedown process
that security guard to score using that

553
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,110
they were told they should no longer use

554
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,950
and they were just late years that the
person who runs the site was linking

555
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,639
the two things together and saying that
these things might be potentially lethal

556
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:24,580
anyway we gotta

557
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,918
DMCA takedown notice for it and the
wording of that

558
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,520
notice was and if this person wants to
file a counter notice they need to put

559
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,668
their personally identifying information
in there

560
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:36,950
and that was too much for a barrier for
the user

561
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,440
on our service so that the content went
down although I will say the

562
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,230
user-defined

563
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,240
moving it to a service called video
weeds which

564
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,570
is day you know if it's in a different
jurisdiction and therefore it doesn't

565
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,980
have to comply with the MCM

566
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,169
and some ugly clients that are related
to this case as well

567
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,000
are journalists working on your major
magazines which combined the new stance

568
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,110
further the magazine's is being %uh
getting DMC taken this is for doctor

569
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,990
Federici

570
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,070
so he silencing even on the journalists
working for magazines that they have

571
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,090
upon my blog

572
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,789
so were beginning to they get a lot of
the attention about

573
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:15,279
the takedown are the hold on techniques
I okay I still a build a significant

574
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,360
failure the DMCA and Chris now about
talk about this but the alleged right

575
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:18,830
holder

576
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,629
the alleged infringer on passionate
argument should be made by those that

577
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,630
most directly affected by the content

578
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,440
so yeah if you should you should you
should be able to

579
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,659
it took to say what you have to say am
about to

580
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:35,409
information it's copyrighted because
other two things everyone into thinking

581
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,399
it was reported a copyright laws you

582
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,340
should be able to critique and parity
and you should be able to use small

583
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,179
parts love

584
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,270
the copyrighted material for fair use a

585
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,158
for analysis for sharing with others yen

586
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,500
in a bit of course what we've seen is
that eyes peas motivated and private

587
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,120
industry

588
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,950
that the defacto my response is Ben

589
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:03,080
to just answer their users to kick them
off their services oh actually I want to

590
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,760
make former No

591
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,260
that it's easy for hosting users to
switch to a service like DOD

592
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,629
because they're sorta diverse and
there's a bunch out there at this point

593
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,809
but it's not as easy for users on
Twitter

594
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,139
Facebook to switch and we have another
user that switch to us for hosting

595
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:22,809
that that had all of their Twitter
accounts and Facebook accounts

596
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:26,330
DMCA ed and they're trying to fight
against like

597
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,780
spammers and scammers on on the Internet
and these people

598
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,639
the MCAL those accounts and now they've
lost all their ability to social network

599
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:37,389
at all and I think the features gonna

600
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:41,139
gonna see this problem getting much
worse and less on the statutes or change

601
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,720
to retake action

602
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,899
so just some examples love what we've
seen

603
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:49,360
so I S p's that that have kept their
users of

604
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,809
without the ability to counter notice
would be weird Press

605
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,908
Go Daddy network solutions and a bunch
of smaller providers

606
00:30:56,909 --> 00:31:00,659
we have a budget we have

607
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,120
use cases or users that have enter cases
for

608
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,429
for every single one of these Assoc and
technology fix these problems

609
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:13,080
%uh well there might be a couple
technical solutions that we can talk

610
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,418
about

611
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:16,539
I wanna give a quick overview of torque
and services and I want to thank you to

612
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:17,830
our people for letting me use the

613
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,780
images of the inservice protocol in the
slides

614
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,289
I'm gonna soon you guys all have
knowledge of how to preserve its work

615
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:28,770
just for now because we have time to
cover it and they were gonna talk a

616
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,330
little bit about it

617
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,230
jurisdiction of insulation and maybe a
little bit about direct action

618
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,450
I'm to speed up a bit so that you guys
can get some questions for us

619
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,360
scan being handful so a let's assume
that the user here's our list may I ask

620
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,250
is bob

621
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,159
us a bobs gonna pick a bunch of
introduction points and it or networks

622
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:44,850
is gonna

623
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:49,139
the circuit x-men production points and
then he's going to take a public key and

624
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:52,389
listed and a directory service

625
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:56,159
that directory service our actions et al
so the user can

626
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,200
lookup the the

627
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,120
identifiers unidentified air in the
directory service and

628
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,649
and she can also pick a really

629
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:09,820
our rendezvous point sir and and then

630
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,529
analysis is going to contact by the
introduction points and for a message on

631
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:15,669
to Bob

632
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:20,120
same that you know okay I'd like to make
sure this rendezvous point

633
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,389
to to build a secure connection to you
and so bob sends back this

634
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:29,580
this token and at the public key and
whatnot me to the rendezvous point in

635
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,090
the two of them establish a secure
connection

636
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,470
so with this network you essentially can
build an entire secure

637
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,629
connection from user to client I'm sorry
from from users server

638
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:45,190
without releasing the identity of either

639
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,070
and this is this is really attractive
but there's a spectrum abusers

640
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,870
right so on on one end of the spectrum

641
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,870
we have all the users that are okay with
commodity hosting and then on the other

642
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,889
far into the spectrum we have all these
years that are probably gonna die if

643
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:01,179
they release their content

644
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,679
I N and Taurus really really good at
this

645
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,429
said over on the other side because
there are some limitations to you how

646
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:09,789
fast or can work

647
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:14,419
and as you can see for the providers ran
for any view that you store no

648
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,429
anything about it or use it in a
passable will

649
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:21,350
agree that you know we make a little bit
about speed compromise will use that the

650
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,450
network

651
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,570
and the percolator showed you actually
has an even larger speed hit

652
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,720
so not all users are ready for that yet

653
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,220
there's a psych spectrum in between is
at the user's that 1i just

654
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,929
half assed hosting but have suffered at
the hands of DMCA takedown provision

655
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:41,929
I am so we're gonna talk a little bit
about

656
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:45,960
how we solve the problem for those users
a couple additional notes

657
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,500
are are that the directory lookup spurt
or

658
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,659
are a bit obscure and that's unfortunate
but

659
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,899
not because it was a design choice but
because it may actually be a

660
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,059
a mathematical truth there's this thing
called as it is conjecture

661
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,629
that says that bees descriptors cannot
be

662
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:08,839
all three things at the same time they
can I have to have these three qualities

663
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,849
which is to be human meaningful security
centralized

664
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:16,129
and and so a there is a service called

665
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:19,790
toward web and I here the developer
toward where is here today and so

666
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:25,290
if you're in the audience and you'd like
to talk after it I'd like to talk to you

667
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,918
come on up but so tired webcam used to

668
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,089
himself the certain obscure unidentified
air

669
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:36,290
problem and you think it is a shame
before that entire protocol is showed

670
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,779
you

671
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,359
i'd allows users to access it and
services through

672
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,830
pretty standard 9 interface

673
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,710
and you can also use your old redirects
to get rid of ads

674
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,230
obscure it on a fire but this means that
the central

675
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,418
you know the central name authority
which means they've done a trade-off

676
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:59,129
having something to centralize for
something human meaningful

677
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,369
but we might be able to use your section
of being too soft that

678
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:05,369
that problem jurisdiction hopping is
something the

679
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,440
that were you if you have contents that
is not

680
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,109
the liebeler something that you don't
wanna put in this country there are

681
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,080
other places you can put it where it is
there is a problem but

682
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,480
one of the complications is this is
you're going to have some legal

683
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,130
complications and technical

684
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,530
on Haven coaxial and Ryan mikey is a
that was first presented here

685
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,790
I think the to hopes ago on about some
other failures they have with Haven co

686
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,950
in summer the vulnerabilities they had
and some other vulnerabilities were

687
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,790
is a is it did you really have to think
about jurisdiction we talk about

688
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,040
something being subpoena proof that's
really

689
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,310
difficult to say on with Haven comb I
think they were

690
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,390
subpoena resistance a.m. but will move
the without getting into

691
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,520
you know well the see an international
above regarding where

692
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,480
Haven co was situate of Haven co is a
platform in the North Sea off the coast

693
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,670
to the UK

694
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,530
used to be a gun platform and David they
put to

695
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,410
they had a I think they're hosting
company and see when was the country

696
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,600
it was taken by adverse possession by
some people the 1960s for pirate radio

697
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,170
on but Haven co was situated Obion

698
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,160
on enough offshore from the UK before
they changed at what it what the

699
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,700
boundaries were for the UK

700
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,940
now they're UK says that there's there
within the UK waters

701
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,819
but this is what's complicated is it do
you have some content to

702
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:22,859
how was it has a rich one as we have
echoes an interesting example but one of

703
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,540
the biggest vulnerabilities was

704
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,000
they were hosting company so contacts at
on those those computers

705
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,830
added Haven co um and their internet
access was through some cables

706
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,580
under the sea they were at one point
looking into satellite uplinks for an

707
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,640
access but that's very expensive I don't
think they ever got that going

708
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,879
but it there the ISP a medium and the
internet was coming from the UK

709
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,609
so if they really had a lot issues the
UK was just gonna turn it off and

710
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:48,690
whoever had all those computers host
there it was

711
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,480
it's gonna go down so that's what your
assertion hopping works like an air

712
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,100
france has some really strict

713
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,420
um laws regarding particular the

714
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,810
a particular speech about differences
nazi paraphernalia is only one France 0

715
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:05,020
its e-bay had some issues with
jurisdiction for people selling things

716
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,009
such as that

717
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,690
it can't be sold in France so if they
went through a lot of technical and

718
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,410
legal

719
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,149
jurisdiction complications on who can
access those types of sites and you

720
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,560
can't if you're from France

721
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,819
so that's the legal and the technical
complications with doing jurisdiction

722
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,460
hopping

723
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,299
and I've heard that I know we're Iceland
Sweden have far more

724
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:26,310
they're setting up some laws could they
want to become to havens for free speech

725
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,480
and its it's coming along but I think
it's not possible to say that anything

726
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,220
is subpoena prefer more truth because he

727
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,319
0 UK its resistant perhaps just as we're
censorship resistant

728
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:41,319
but yeah it's it's never true your and
so the point is that you know different

729
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:42,730
jurisdictions have

730
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,790
different constraints on the content
that can be hosted there so

731
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,040
a particular jurisdiction may be more
sympathetic to a certain type of content

732
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,359
than another particular jurisdiction

733
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:57,520
I ready so this is gonna be like really
fast I'm gonna go to Ubuntu slides here

734
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,740
%uh so what we're working on now is a

735
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,280
such as diverse as an infrastructure we
have developed no to San Jose and

736
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,859
Oakland

737
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:09,359
and Sweden we had access to and in
Sweden I'm

738
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,680
so our hope so that we can build some
sort of censorship resistant

739
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,509
infrastructure that allows people to
jurisdiction of the sympathetic

740
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,599
jurisdictions and and to be to be clear
what we're not what we are not setting

741
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,069
up is a place for you can put like
illegal content. overseas because it's

742
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,900
illegal here

743
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,220
what we're doing is for on for cases
such as like doctor feder each use case

744
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,359
this is that these are the types of
clients that we did we host on

745
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,109
right free speech is really doesn't love
like people talking about other children

746
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:36,848
a diet or

747
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:40,330
you know sometimes a protest that that
is that those with our clients

748
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,580
read so this isn't about other
copyrighted movies this is

749
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,970
the battle for the casualties about more

750
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,980
so this is all the people that are
unfairly affected by this for preserving

751
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,849
fair use that's what we're trying to do

752
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:57,270
%uh so 'em basically a

753
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,710
I think that this is inevitably a
stopgap solution

754
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,310
at some point so we have something like
toward that is inherently secure

755
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,509
and supports privacy and anonymity but

756
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,780
I you know until we can can move that
and to demand where all users can use it

757
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,930
I think that that we need us assertive
transitional technology to get us there

758
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,540
on so a we're gonna talk about cells

759
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,670
%uh these are cells as in guerrilla
cells being that there's no strategic

760
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,230
asset for someone to go after to take
down the

761
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,410
network and you guys are gonna like my
diagram some share

762
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,410
its engineering paper with pencil and
some public hurt and things to remember

763
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,420
a so you basically have the

764
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,010
a the Internet and then we have cells
like this and as they sell the open

765
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,369
selma sweet and sell better connected to
a virtual private network

766
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:49,410
%uh and content essentially needs to
exist

767
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,930
outside a anyone jurisdiction so
distribution of responsibility in

768
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,149
isolation control

769
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,549
this basically says that the admins in
this particular infrastructure should

770
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:01,780
only have control over the cells
resources

771
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,060
that they control and by users should
have control over

772
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,290
where the resources locate know what you
think a resource as

773
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,420
a domain it could be I mean as any sort
of service that you would provide

774
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,869
as wannabes types if I S p's it could be

775
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:20,569
a torta web interface

776
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:23,839
now so you have a a user and cell

777
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,190
admin and a good you can read that

778
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,810
so let's just say we have fubared DOD
dotnet

779
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,540
and and these are the places where
Freebird IDOT doubt it is hosted

780
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,290
I'm at any given point bi-pin can turn
off

781
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,950
the thats access in a particular
jurisdiction says that this had been has

782
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,000
control over the San Jose in the open
cell

783
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,650
but not this weekend so they can they
can say oh no sorry this resource can no

784
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,420
longer be hosted in these locations

785
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,000
I and that the user can do the same
sales women's lightweight too far away I

786
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,869
don't offer mine

787
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,740
my content Sweden you know so Keystone
offered their

788
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,940
they can also say we have another case a
furnace going through that needed to

789
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,770
switch to us

790
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,900
by the way it's really a father really
messed up right now

791
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,589
and from what I hear there's there's
hardly any hope for them

792
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:13,450
to train to turn that stuff around but
say I think in

793
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,599
now this user could say oh I don't know
who's this Australia and it'll

794
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,190
host another location a redundancy data
a course

795
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,900
you need the redundancy you need your
day to be more than wonder six at a time

796
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,170
that way

797
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,750
we have that strategic asset principle
that no strategic asset can be taken

798
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,720
down

799
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,400
%uh and and the resources should be

800
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,619
jurisdiction resilient you know that is
that

801
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:39,170
there's jurisdictional diversity and
here's an important one

802
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,339
this is those sir the principle that
works on as well

803
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:45,940
is that there should be no one
organization likes a project DOD

804
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,400
in control of the entire infrastructure
that it should be at the buyer's

805
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,500
divers at organizations may be multiple
organizations in each jurisdiction that

806
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,900
control the infrastructure

807
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,310
up next to gather eyes to the policies
one organization

808
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,259
don't affect the content and any any
particular

809
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,150
a so a how this is gonna be fun if he
doesn't like this comes here

810
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,990
security researchers in this is a
hacking con um

811
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,390
so we're going to have a little fun
experiment about

812
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,379
about what if we were to treat the DMCA
takedown critical flaws

813
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,810
as per of us I'm so I want to cover what
those were going to surf rest their

814
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,240
guilty until proven innocent and a
denial of service attack out the back

815
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,010
door

816
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,170
takedowns rates are going to the ISP's
on the endless chain attack which is now

817
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,799
we're just constantly getting

818
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,430
takedown notices and having to
reevaluate the content ultimately I

819
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,230
think we'll show that I ski liability
has to go away

820
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:44,140
in order for this type of censorship to
stop sewing this rhetorical questions

821
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,230
what we treat filing answer when we
treat the failing to the MCA

822
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,970
as protocol failing to take that take
them provision we treat those

823
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,130
as protocol vulnerabilities and

824
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,660
what we treat lawmakers likes of our
vendors

825
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,140
%uh and waterproof concept could be used
to highlight DMCA vertical flaws

826
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,060
so others hospital's closure movement
says basically ever a vendor releases

827
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,779
a bug and a security researcher finds a
theoretical but I really informs the

828
00:43:12,779 --> 00:43:13,609
vendor

829
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:17,180
a the vendor decides not to fix the bug

830
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,750
and and so they're researcher releases
that

831
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,490
in a white paper some way to the public
and then the vendor

832
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,359
you know says publicly oh no no no no
this is your theoretical the Sun never

833
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,600
happen like now we can actually pull
this attack of

834
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,569
and so a researcher maybe not the same
one decides to rate for

835
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:37,170
concept of the x-play and the fender

836
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,330
winds up hopefully fixing about

837
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,850
that's the trick is what we treat the
DMCA

838
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,640
the same way so let's imagine what
happens if we have

839
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,040
the same project universe Federici thing
except the amplifier

840
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,759
them we're gonna posit an anonymous
malicious actor named Mallory

841
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,890
and are we're going to design or just
use

842
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,379
a but never got no its second cell said
send well-crafted

843
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,160
DMCA takedown notices and follow-up
notices to multiple ISP's

844
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,690
against multiple users again this is all
theoretical

845
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,210
right we're just trying to highlight
that there's a a major political

846
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,120
vulnerability here

847
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,109
and so what I what you think of this as
kind of a a web crawler that goes around

848
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:23,690
fines content on the internet

849
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,520
and then constructs these really well
crafted DMCA takedown notices

850
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,569
and fire some of in mass

851
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,650
to you to these ISP's

852
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,660
and so there's a couple requirements
here one is that Mallory the person

853
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,029
doing this there are going to be cast be
hidden in order to not suffer if I told

854
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:41,960
Jeff

855
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,990
counter notice the notes that are
sending

856
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,799
cannot be tracked back to their
controllers that is that things are 27

857
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,029
the notes can be tracked back to Mallory

858
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:54,790
and the notes themselves need to be
exposed otherwise would be statistically

859
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:58,950
interesting information that would show
you where where the

860
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,040
assert would would tell you that the
step was coming say from a torn our

861
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,589
or something um so a visa taken a
decision like a lot

862
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:12,609
like legitimate notices they can use for
random legit looking letterheads

863
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,819
you can get the stuff I might join
effect start

864
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:20,029
you wanna hear have some anonymous
contact information e-mail address

865
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:24,350
us a prepaid phone number way something
like that and

866
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,750
ants yeah and that

867
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,339
the notices should be sent not owing to
you the first order I ski which would be

868
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:31,620
the

869
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,359
ISBN a leaf node a at any particular
point by

870
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,200
all and third her eyes peas and this
would happen

871
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,839
whenever someone didn't respond to
notices or whenever

872
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:47,400
the notice had been responded to an
account and went back up you gonna

873
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,799
escalated up to the next ISP

874
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:54,299
and I so wanted to to just point out
that

875
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:56,790
these things should be sent to search
engines to you because there's an

876
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,830
interesting but our ability and that

877
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,839
search engines don't really have users
for the crawl content they find the

878
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,140
stuff the index in sometimes the cash it

879
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,020
and DMCA takedown notices can be filed
to Google for instance

880
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,799
and Google will actually remove fat
content from the index

881
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:15,569
and but they don't have a user to inform
sat at a counter notice can be filed so

882
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:19,810
basically a visa attackers can can
remove content directly out of the index

883
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,020
the search engines

884
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,250
using a so I just really quick this is
how we would build it

885
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,390
serene sonic healthcare and which is a
disturbing job processing free market

886
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,480
has been to clients

887
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,500
us job servers and some workers and

888
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,690
a and over here at the client the job
server interface in the worker

889
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,859
her job sir interface this is not just
gonna work out a box I would have to be

890
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:42,560
shamed here to work with Tor

891
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,759
this is a stack application code be
written in C PHP

892
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,080
whatever it goes through a Karen server
which is a queue

893
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,700
and then it worker listens for functions
that are registered in there

894
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,310
and can process it also in a different
language

895
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,380
%uh and you can see that the Aero
services where so these locations

896
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,420
after insertion into a a turnover get
ready here comes another in my progress

897
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,430
against her %uh so it's a

898
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,560
basically this is what what it would
look like %uh you have a a takedown

899
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,029
notice

900
00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:16,279
%uh you have a network you have

901
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:19,690
gear and server and then you have these
two way communications using

902
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:23,619
ahead and services through the door on
the network to settings on the workers

903
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:27,529
and some ISP's over here and he's on the
workers are exposed right

904
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,779
%uh so so basically you

905
00:47:30,779 --> 00:47:34,119
the same Mallory fires the takedown
notice of it lands on the on

906
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:38,609
care and job server one other workers
comes by and says oh hey I can take that

907
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:39,410
job

908
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,020
and and then the worker winds up

909
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,920
firing this sort of abuse of that the
ISP's and because there's a certain

910
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,100
queuing system and you can move from
state to state

911
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,240
by you can essentially these workers
over here

912
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,220
say they found the first notice they can
then wreak you job in just let it sit

913
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,560
here and and another worker I'll pick it
up

914
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,529
and and you can move to the States a bit
whether or not you're escalating to an

915
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:03,210
ISP

916
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,680
answer whether I traffic going to and
order a skier

917
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,750
in the end result %uh would be that
service providers

918
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,580
on me actually decide they want to
continue order to start following a

919
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,240
counter notice procedures sense

920
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,540
so many other users they just have to
kick off their service and again

921
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,230
remember this is

922
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,740
and in mass transit like this would be
like scammers using this technique that

923
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,089
has fired off

924
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:27,310
but then there's still the $10 data now
service attack

925
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,109
by and and so I ask you to probably not
to comply with that

926
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,350
and this of this abuse takes into
account that during in changing as well

927
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,609
so so in the Vikings great enough

928
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:43,089
ISP's may actually be forced to you stop
complying

929
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:47,470
with takedown notices that is

930
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,750
in a in they can make a a good-faith
attempt to comply with them so they

931
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,299
would actually have to stop

932
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:57,150
and ultimately that would bring the La
back into question and I think that we

933
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,509
could show

934
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:03,119
through are under an abuse like this
that no matter what you have to rewrite

935
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,240
on the law tako at I think in a very and

936
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,540
all these particular statutes which
we'll talk about here

937
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,040
but also ISP liability alright remove
the ten-day and

938
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,609
district dial service attack that's
problematic slow time

939
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:20,040
um at this really this is a let me just
say that the

940
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,970
with up with you this was my time but I
if you're interested and and making

941
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:24,720
these changes

942
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,380
%uh support chilling effect stork BFF
and

943
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,259
our organization does this store but
chilling effect is actually working to

944
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:35,420
amend the DMCA and one of the things
that we're discussing in the amendments

945
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,560
is sad

946
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,549
is you need to consider fair use before
you send those takedown notices if

947
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:41,130
they're bogus and they just really

948
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,859
you're just doing it just wanna
competitor two stops one for releasing a

949
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,480
bug that you wanted to first

950
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,960
you should have some my ability for that
if you're just slamming a.m.

951
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,250
the I S at so the ISP up the street as
well

952
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,940
I think every time you go up the stream
it doesn't work at it should be like

953
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,359
greater liability because it's really
adding a lot of time to the IT

954
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,580
department don't wanna handle this
especially for stuff that is just meant

955
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,020
for

956
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,489
like corporate strategic advantage being
offensive using below that way

957
00:50:04,489 --> 00:50:08,690
this was not the DMCA was intended to do
yes so you know it we're close to the

958
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,380
end so I mean it was actually just skip

959
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,140
and what the future look like on the
future look like what he has to look

960
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,900
like over the MC existed

961
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:21,200
hmm it look like the past and so you
know clearly DMCA takedown prison for

962
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,619
flood

963
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:27,690
and there's a couple technical solutions
that exist out there

964
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,759
and if anybody has questions please feel
free to ask

965
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:34,589
also notice the paper and slides her
online here K my cousin

966
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:38,609
real quick um as one to point out that
um

967
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:42,950
ISP's do have the option under the DMCA
not to remove the linker liability

968
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,520
up for CNC a dozen actually require
exactly four and some ISP's including

969
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,279
Google

970
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:51,290
actually do analysis

971
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,380
above the that's it the takedown notices
and don't necessarily remove

972
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,540
automatically

973
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,850
and what a fair use review and and
things like that rose it

974
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,890
it's still Google actually does a decent
job

975
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:07,069
other ISP's don't don't do as well and
we've also made that decision to to

976
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:09,279
waver safe harbor in certain cases

977
00:51:09,279 --> 00:51:13,319
yeltsin's thanks thanks

978
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:17,630
aren't response to on swear under
penalty of perjury when you file a DMCA

979
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,720
takedown notice

980
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,980
so isn't this just distributed perjury

981
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,299
will arm so that was the trick rate
miller's identity can be found so it's

982
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:27,540
distributed perjury but

983
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,910
who is Mallory right okay just yes oh
yeah absolutely SMEs elsewhere

984
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,190
so where we swear under penalty of
perjury but it the

985
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:39,970
the request can be tracked back to the
person sending them

986
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,730
with the system that you guys we're
showing their not the wanted

987
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,600
now service but all we have the servers
all over the world ocean

988
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,970
is is the the DNS updated on dynamically

989
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:55,009
and is that I'll bring any liability in
effect so for example the same way the

990
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:57,869
2600 I'm trouble for DVD John's code

991
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:01,480
you know what if you say oh we can have
is the US fine gonna put in Sweden hi

992
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,270
few

993
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,170
rate but now you're your redirecting a
sweet and does that make you liable

994
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,680
because you're saying here

995
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,970
stuff so with you the tools to take down
so really quick what we've done is we've

996
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,770
shamed into that were

997
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,259
Onion Router spread so essentially I i
mean this is just a proposal right there

998
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,210
but networks right now that art nearly
impossible to

999
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,290
to figure out I was just saying that you
could do this

1000
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:28,279
anonymously this way and so DNS actually
can be leveraged to find the identity of

1001
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:31,369
the hosting provider that they had a
service protocol does it scare that

1002
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:35,640
eternity

1003
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,089
oh the owner upon posting different
places oh yes yes yes so this is just

1004
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,560
assira said this is a ser stopgap
solution ups are at an

1005
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,569
I didn't bring actually get the point to
question their

1006
00:52:45,569 --> 00:52:48,710
okay so yes I guess they could um

1007
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,680
they can find your DNS maybe they can
check your DNS down and this is why

1008
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,390
Taurus

1009
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:56,230
is necessary in in certain cases is that

1010
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,710
that the US could shut down yeah your

1011
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:03,509
you had a slider titled responsible
disclosure think about that quickly

1012
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:08,989
osha exam I just like to point out that
you're right step 7

1013
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:13,569
is wrong at step seven is actually than
200 nobody can notice to the researcher

1014
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:14,369
in Texas Dept

1015
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,710
Def Con talk to I

1016
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:22,549
as that's a that's very true right so
and the DMC is used to silence them

1017
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:26,930
my question is answered have your suit
using ARM defamation libel strategies

1018
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,049
against the authors

1019
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:32,339
forty agents for take-down notices and
possibly pursuing our unfair business

1020
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:33,400
practices

1021
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,450
so this is love this is commercial
speech as opposed to

1022
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,029
free speech percent I i havent

1023
00:53:40,029 --> 00:53:43,210
yeah we actually are as I did that the
live over considering as some

1024
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:46,819
maybe even that the curve it attorneys
that had some issues with us but more

1025
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:50,500
levels the is as difficult it can be
difficult to prove especially this one

1026
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,100
maliciously went out to

1027
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,060
you know that just to say things that
they were unsure about about someone

1028
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:00,109
in actually doctor feder each year has
first before he did found the DMCA

1029
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:02,210
takedown notices added be able to

1030
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,960
get what you want so that he did file
multiple many libel suits

1031
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,279
they were not successful so that's why
you switch the DMCA takedown notice

1032
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:14,020
in has just been applied for academic
research currently right now because

1033
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:19,170
there's a lot there's a longer tradition
will salvage for fair use

1034
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:23,119
all and that is it is and as a never say
about professor

1035
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,180
I can I can tell you from from personal
experience that fair use is dying

1036
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,430
and it even in academia for having a
really difficult time with that and I

1037
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,299
look at look at films work at each about
that what happened

1038
00:54:33,299 --> 00:54:36,580
with him groundbreaking some encryption
I and discussing that

1039
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:40,670
how he broke the encryption that the for
the MCAT as I circumvention measures but

1040
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,210
talking about having a talk about a
resurgent teachers students to you

1041
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,819
and you know to do things but at this is
where for use is is dying and being able

1042
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,839
to discuss research is hard

1043
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,790
think sets 156 sounds a lot like there's
any more questions so

1044
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,460
thanks everybody for giving us your time
