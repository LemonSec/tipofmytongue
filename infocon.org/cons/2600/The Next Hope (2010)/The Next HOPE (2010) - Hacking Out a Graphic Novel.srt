1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,850
and ho said

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,330
pennsylvania is a small suburb out of
Pittsburgh

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,690
and I it's affectionately known as the
rust belt

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,280
because the entire economy of the area

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,840
relied on steel manufacture on

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,090
to sort of sustain itself and in the
eighties I

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,189
that industry went away and that's when
I was born

8
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,880
so there was no way my parents were
going to

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,629
be able to afford to hook me up with the
computer for

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,270
any cool gadgets or anything like that I
mean a a talk

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,040
probably 15-16 years for more is a lot
to make it possible

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,510
for my family did to a to

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,820
get the computer that I wanted arm even
though I put it on my Christmas list

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,590
I every year up until that point

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,370
I'm what was easily available to me

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,719
was pencils in paper and

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
I another sorta aspect of the area that
I come from

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,700
is that gang culture started to become

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,650
very very popular and that was a scene
that I obviously was not

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,400
I able to fit in with and there were
shootings

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,820
outside my house all the time when I was
5 I saw

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,490
on the police issued a guy in the back
of my head in a be my backyard

23
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,520
found when I was 12 grow back

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,579
killed in the alley behind my house we
moved

25
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,470
from the first place where I saw a guy
get shot remove the way

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,100
and down you know a few blocks away and
somebody got killed in the back my other

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,530
house

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,229
on and shortly after that my next door
neighbor the shy so

29
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,280
I was afraid to leave the house

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,710
no computer no online access lotsa
pencils and paper

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,840
and I basically just escaped in my room

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,479
arm drawing constantly um

33
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,549
trying to figure out how to our

34
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,259
basically make way I see in my head

35
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,920
appear on paper which I'm still not
successful at

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,670
but it's getting closer on I

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,700
and I also escaped and in comic books I
really I

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,800
enjoy the idea of telling stories of
paper with words and pictures was kinda

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,050
magical to me on

40
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,010
you know you look at one image in the
next image and there's a passage of time

41
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,090
that intuitively takes place

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,300
arm without any sort of exposition or
dialogue like you know five minutes

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,940
later tennis later anything like they
like your brain scan process information

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,599
in its a

45
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,738
it's a communication attacking

46
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,120
communication tool that sorta has been
around on

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,459
since late cave paintings and stuff like
that I mean

48
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,310
I we've been telling stories the
pictures forever

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,569
arm at a certain point

50
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,220
I E in high school on I start again

51
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,680
a little bit better at arm drying in
making comics and I ended up going to

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,370
art school

53
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,250
are not too far from here actually arm
and really

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,159
sorry to pursue the idea of telling
stories with pictures and words

55
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,599
and thankfully I kinda bet my life on

56
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,670
the idea that comics could be considered

57
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,440
are a a viable former literature

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,010
that arm could express

59
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,359
any sort I love subject matter it didn't
have to be like

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,030
this superhero shit with our guys in
tights and

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,430
flying around punching bad guys the
walls and stuff like that I mean I kinda

62
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,540
like summer that stuff too

63
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,920
wat found in Japan

64
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,980
there are comics manga

65
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,560
that on explore any sort of subject
matter you can imagine there are

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,010
there are among the four housewives

67
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,620
who you know group regularly go to at
the grocery store

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,090
and that's what the stories about 10
there are among about fishermen in

69
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,140
all sorts of subject matter I'm this
idea is catching on

70
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,690
and I America and

71
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,440
sorta in tandem with my

72
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,740
coming to the gene Tom

73
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,350
actually developing the ability that to
draw comics in a in a reasonable way

74
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,910
on bookstores and

75
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,910
academia have even to a certain extent

76
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,720
on accepted the idea of comics as

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,889
more than just escapist fare

78
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,160
forearm four dudes who live in the
basement or were in a myspace matter

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,139
what I

80
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm when I was about 20m

81
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,130
21 22 years old I really started
submitting my work two different

82
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,360
companies

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,060
to our to try and get some more
professionally

84
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,270
drying comics which what I've always
wanted to do

85
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,090
and like I said I sorta bet my life I
itself

86
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,840
we'll see how that ends up in a couple
years I'm

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,070
and I i kinda got rejected from most
other publishers just the stuff that I

88
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,560
was doing a just

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,720
VM the writing doing catch up with the
for work

90
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,830
arm and its so the stories were a little
juvenile law and

91
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,008
is not very good on I sent a lot of the
stuff to

92
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,240
various cartoonists who I his work I
appreciate it

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,669
am just for some sort of feedback figure
out what the heck I was doing wrong

94
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,359
because I was trying my best blah blah

95
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,820
on and I sergei some interesting
responses

96
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,070
I'm whether those responses was from

97
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,370
Eiseman in Harvey Picower a fire
American Splendor

98
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,539
it's wonderful %ah

99
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,860
and yet he he passed away Monday

100
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,919
I'll which really sucks I

101
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,630
and this is this right after the
American Splendor movie came out

102
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,909
on so he was at at sorta the height of
his fame

103
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,380
and I was looking through some old
American Splendor comics I've

104
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,880
appreciated his work pretty much my
entire life

105
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,389
and I thought I the artwork was lacking
in a lot of

106
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,650
those strips arm

107
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,009
and that on one of these American
Splendor comics I had

108
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,449
it was like a facsimile the cover was
like a facsimile

109
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,400
time magazine who cover with up for
Travis face not try it was a photograph

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,780
and you know when you subscribe to a
magazine there's that like on mechanical

111
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,259
type that has your subscription
information like

112
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,110
landed on it well it had his like a
fellow version of his

113
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,910
subscription information like his name
an address on the cover this thing

114
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,009
and I was will like wondering you with
is this

115
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,509
address still valid or did this guy move
to a to a castle in beverly hills or

116
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,160
something like that

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,610
so wire just through my routine of
sending

118
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,789
my failed comic strips to

119
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,889
various cartoonist whose work I
appreciated

120
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,470
and I started sending

121
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,500
less trips to that address not really
expecting that it was his real address

122
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,970
or anything like that

123
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,360
and I didn't hear back for a while arm
and the after months and months of just

124
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,220
sending

125
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,530
maybe 50-60 packs love

126
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,270
strips like every month

127
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,090
on a gotta phone call

128
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,860
from P car and I like I said this is
after the movie came out

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,440
and I had to drag some friends to go
check out this flick because

130
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,740
you know didn't get any sort of

131
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,900
arm any sort of fun commercial

132
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,590
distribution or anything like that in a
way there was no trailer on TV

133
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,590
for this flexo my friends really never
heard of it and it was a tough sale to

134
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,650
get them to come hang out with me i
didnt really wanna see it alone I don't

135
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,780
wanna be back kinda Peter

136
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,340
a and so I brought a couple buddies a
along

137
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,060
in when a peak are called my house he is
a very very distinct

138
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,419
groff Boyce and a

139
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,389
I have a buddy who could do i mean peak
or a person nation

140
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,799
and I thought to myself you know if this

141
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,440
is you HB column my buddies names HP

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,990
this is HB call me that this is the most
vicious prank

143
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,440
that you can pull on me because you know
I wanted to draw comics so much

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,080
and I didn't believe him at first when
he was on the phone and I expressed this

145
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,690
to a certain extent in his fight what
the hell you talking about is how

146
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,860
above the what can I do I've

147
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm so it you know i i obviously I
believe them at that point and I'm

148
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,459
we corresponded of for like a year

149
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:12,019
before a any real actual work came down
the pike

150
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:17,320
and eventually we started putting a
project together and

151
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,170
called American Splendor our movie year
in a July 20 pages of this

152
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,709
like two hundred-page anthology book

153
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,290
on it was very cool um it at first day I
did like four pages

154
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,689
and and towards the end of the project
they needed

155
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,070
a quick 25 page story done in like under
a month

156
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,320
and when you drop comics I'm

157
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,360
you know that the standard size is
fairly small

158
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,290
but the original pages that you drawn
are pretty huge at least twice the size

159
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,370
of the final printed page so the work
that I was doing was about

160
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,790
11 by seventeen that's a lot of pencil
mileage as they call it

161
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,110
and it takes a long time to do a page of
comics

162
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,140
are so after doing our move your stuff I
E

163
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,519
he and I set to work on a low form
graphic novel called massive Donia

164
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,700
on that you know receive some mixed
reviews because I mean this subject

165
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,529
matters little

166
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,180
a little complex in crazy on it's a it's
about the geopolitical destabilization

167
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,649
in the Bakken region

168
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:27,209
if you're interested on

169
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,880
ants you know he adapted this work from

170
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,430
I a woman's thesis at

171
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,730
University California Berkeley so it's
very very

172
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,910
heady to sit to say the least on any any

173
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,870
way when I was working on that project
IOM

174
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,260
assertive ran out of all DVD audio
commentaries that I was listening to I

175
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,240
memorized everything I was tired i've

176
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,079
every piece of music that I had access
to you

177
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,430
on I really a mess around with like to
peer to peer stuff at that time or

178
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,010
anything like that and I

179
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,730
really know about it on

180
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,760
podcasting really starting to become a
thing and

181
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,459
I was added to get member tech TV rest
in peace tech TV

182
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,579
a star love that stuff and then you know
that

183
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,560
that channel one away and and those are
the people from taking feel a lil afford

184
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,110
they started

185
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,019
podcasting so that I was introduced to
the two that idea

186
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,209
and I happened upon off the hook

187
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,440
on you know was tagged under hacking or
something like that

188
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,940
and packing is always something that
I've

189
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,670
romanticized in my mind on

190
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,430
it's something I A thought about and I
movie

191
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,100
ideas that I had about Hagel who were
certainly ideas that were put my head by

192
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,630
mass media

193
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,310
arm that movie where Ferris Bueller I
you know hacks into you

194
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,430
the the the government computers in
order at or something like that in

195
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,750
0 cool and all that bullshit

196
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,860
um when I came across off the hook

197
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,230
arm I literally was hooked on

198
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,060
and i ended up listening to the entire
twenty-plus year archive

199
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,029
of that show what you which I if if you
have time available to do this

200
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:26,370
on you know because usually I'm but I'm
sitting there drawing comics

201
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,950
all day I am the mass Dhoni graphic
novels like 150 pages

202
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,880
took me 14 months to do and an F
fourteen months I was able to listen to

203
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,860
all of the

204
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,220
off the hook up

205
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,269
archives on and if you listen to it all

206
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,670
you can fast-forward through the
fundraiser episodes and I'll tell them I

207
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,190
say

208
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,269
said that %ah

209
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,519
yeah there are some at BIC

210
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,990
sprawling stories that take place

211
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,420
with in that show if you listen to in a
linear fashion

212
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,730
on and is so much so that there is high
drama

213
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,529
that took place on this show on it's my
belief

214
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,839
that show should be our public in the
smithsonian I i feel that it is so

215
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,070
important

216
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,870
because on it really captures a moment
in time

217
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,670
where just that government was so

218
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,200
not that there were any more you know I
in the know nowadays but they were so

219
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,709
clueless

220
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,089
back then and its it's laughable and

221
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:39,279
on you know just you to follow the
history of high technology

222
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,990
through that show on there is like an
episode where a man was like

223
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,240
know if you go to your local community
college

224
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,709
sign up for one class and you will have
access to the Internet

225
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,589
its amazing I'm

226
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,180
and just you know buy it buy his
privileged position to as being

227
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,829
publisher 2600 he obviously had access
to some

228
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:07,589
really interesting personalities I
within the community

229
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:12,610
and day have you guys listen to a lot of
that show a mic

230
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,889
de my telling something you got
something that you already know

231
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:20,850
um where I was fascinated by the stories
are flake

232
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,600
Bernie s where you know he is on the
show for years

233
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,829
and then eventually he's like pinched by
the cops

234
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,199
and he's not on the show the the United
that

235
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,930
that week or whatever and then he's on
the show again talking about his

236
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,519
upcoming

237
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,810
case and then he's gone again

238
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,870
at Denny's in jail and they he they
figure out an elaborate away

239
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,550
for bernie to call Emanuel's house and
have their number I'll medically

240
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,170
forwarded

241
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,920
forwarded to WBAI because

242
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,399
it sort of gets a rules for bernie to
call the radio station /a br/

243
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,740
broadcast by that's a good tricky
workaround

244
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,870
and he was like on the show from Joon
you heard like a little be

245
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,820
every every I couple of minutes that to
let you know that the

246
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,170
calls being recorded or whatever this
this is our

247
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,410
fantastic story fodder on

248
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,529
fiber-optic who was on the show

249
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,610
for do for you know years before

250
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,160
the forearm other stuff from

251
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,540
what will masters of deception ever read
that book on

252
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,569
the stuff from masses and inception took
place

253
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,630
and then up fiber had a court case

254
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,680
and he was still on the show but it
became weird to me because he was

255
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,259
allowed to really talk about anything
when before he is just

256
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,589
very I who is very happy to speak about

257
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,149
any so love number of things he

258
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,589
was kinda flaked his lawyers advising
the childish trap

259
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:01,320
Lake about these particular issues with
our regarding this case

260
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,339
and then he went to jail and

261
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,570
the sheik they they played a show but
like the day before the

262
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,070
took 'em to prison and

263
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,000
it was emotional I was sitting there
drawing a little comics like dropping

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
tears on my paper

265
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,980
I'm because this poor kid are

266
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,860
is going away for a year I mean I was
there was unbelievable to me and the kid

267
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,149
is a i mean

268
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,320
you note you got to know him as much as
he let you

269
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,779
get to know him by listening to the show

270
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:36,350
and on you know so fiber disappeared in

271
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,360
because he was in jail and Emanuel
continue the show with a few other

272
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,149
people here and there

273
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:46,110
on and then they the the year goes by

274
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,230
you know enough in a matter of like a
week if you're listening to twenty

275
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,730
episodes a day or something

276
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,660
and you know they play I rude boy is out
of jail by the specials

277
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,880
on during the show where they're
bringing fiber back

278
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,260
to Manhattan after he's out of jail

279
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,459
you know that after his release and it
was epic Amin it was

280
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,949
it gave me two tickets give me chills
just thinking about it

281
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,910
on obviously the mitnick stuff was
really interesting

282
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,069
another interesting thing about I off
the hook when I was seeing

283
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,159
drunk on its all day listening to the
show was that

284
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,860
arm I and the annual whenever a new

285
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,830
book online hacking or specific more
specifically on particular hackers like

286
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,539
porcelain

287
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,919
mitnick fiber-optic in those guys

288
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,080
on Emanuel would it be able

289
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,189
would have access to interview these
guys about them for the work

290
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,400
and so after listening to the entire
archive

291
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,530
that arm I decided to skip to explore
those books there are at the local

292
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,570
library

293
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,480
and you notice upon further research in
reading

294
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,929
on I A come across like

295
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,010
work like people and tap frack

296
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,289
2600 I all sorts matter in a

297
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,080
I'm just as all just reading for
pleasure arm certainly inspired by

298
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,629
interesting stories

299
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,000
that I've passively listen to while

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,240
with I'll you know absorbing I love the

301
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
I off the hook archive

302
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,928
and I start develop these

303
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,520
and I felt it psychologically

304
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,510
a lot of the more sort of observed

305
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,600
hackers that were written about on the
at the All Share

306
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,130
fairly similar psychological traits as
far as I could tell this may know

307
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,340
in true-life might not really be the
case it probably isn't

308
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,100
on but I answered a lot of similar cycle
psychological traits

309
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,400
and to be honest a lot of the same
mental energy

310
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,690
mental energies I kinda fun

311
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,419
identified with as being an obsessive

312
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:08,960
crazy cartoonist who

313
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,860
I never sleep either and I'm constantly
working

314
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,220
in the same way these guys are costly or
our energy is just

315
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,440
split in different ways and maybe if I
had access to such

316
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,010
technology when I was younger first you
know your formative years are big deal

317
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,280
to cover your formative years for a
reason

318
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,770
and for some reason I just really
identified with

319
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,760
these guys a benign a romantic way like
anything I was like a call fugitive or

320
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,809
you know a suburban MacGyver or
something like that

321
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,500
I just on I really can't explain
articulate like how I

322
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,490
really identified with with on these
individuals

323
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,110
with their mindsets when I played on but
I did

324
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,549
and on I sort of had this idea like

325
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:00,760
you know I really wanna do my my own
comic that I'm reading in trying myself

326
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,320
because I was working with peak are I've
just drawing for a couple years

327
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,450
and I felt like

328
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,200
through osmosis a reading all this
information

329
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,780
and listening to the off the hook show
and all that sort of stuff

330
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,120
honor that in terms of being a
cartoonist this

331
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,350
this is a story I could tell that

332
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,860
arm probably no other cartoonist could
because maybe the

333
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,490
you must these guys are not interested
in such stuff I'll

334
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,220
maybe they don't have a four the for the
fortitude to listen to twenty-plus year

335
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,400
archive of this radio show

336
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,690
arm whatever the case may be I decided

337
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,690
to maybe take

338
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,400
the stories is that the most interesting
parts have all

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,760
I love the hackers that I was reading
about and create a kind of pastiche

340
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,370
snare it have I compiling all this
information into

341
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,909
one character in seeing what would
happen

342
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,260
if he live the lives I love

343
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,850
wake a young mitnick Poulsen fiber-optic
Bernie s

344
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,919
all these people II in one

345
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,580
body so that's sort of how is the week
developed

346
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,908
and arm I i set to work to put put the
comp get I sort of had an idea of

347
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:26,520
the audience and I it was weird because
I really didn't expect

348
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,889
anybody tit to dig it I thought I was
gonna be like the one volume I i kinda

349
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,850
left it is like a cliffhanger

350
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:37,000
just in case people found it sort of
interesting or something

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,340
arm and

352
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,389
it for some ways I I did it as it was
calling many comic winning many comic is

353
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,950
is basically

354
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,669
like you're you're a your hope program

355
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,200
book it's just like in a half mile in
peace taking paper

356
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,350
folded in half that's initially

357
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,240
what was the way it was arm just really
there

358
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,640
the card many comics & in the biz on

359
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,240
n/a make money xeroxes is no big deal
it's like a dollar day to make the

360
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,700
things Angela for

361
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,470
a dollar fifty years something on

362
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,470
and just saw the way I like it was
getting to be nearer and nearer

363
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,080
christmastime and wonderful was asking
you know what do you want for Christmas

364
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,360
and I could I think anything so I was
just like you know it

365
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,000
how about if I no really plug away

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,450
and it put this who put together would
you

367
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,890
by Neil a a hundred copies at this thing
arm

368
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,909
you know it's a print-on-demand place
and you know she

369
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:42,039
said yes and so christmas comes along
and

370
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,650
I receive this box actually like five
boxes are

371
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,070
these 100 with the wake volume 1 comics

372
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,780
and I it kinda the kinda fucked my head
up

373
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:59,340
because I was located now I have a whole
lot of like a excuses for insulation

374
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,809
and my bedroom or something like what am
I gonna do it they ship

375
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,520
I'm I mean I could give a couple copies
way to my friends in the there then

376
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
there's still

377
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,658
ninety copies I'm I had no idea what to
do with these things

378
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:19,299
whatsoever and I just sort of had the
idea of maybe

379
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:23,360
you know I listen to all these podcasts
and surly off the hook in

380
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,429
things like that and on you know they
certainly inspired the work

381
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,299
in a big big way so maybe they would get
a kick

382
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,389
out of checking these things out or
something so you know I sent 12

383
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,990
2i the 2600 PO Box

384
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,179
and sense stuff too the different
podcasts

385
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,000
that I am that I've enjoyed and listen
to allow while I was working on

386
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,490
illustrations are comments or whatever

387
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,960
and then what started to happen was on

388
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,070
I surgery to receive orders for

389
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,270
for the a the comic say I just just
email

390
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,120
at emails KK man like you know it do you
have these for sale

391
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,150
and I think a manual took 'em took

392
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,390
with the way to like the 2600 meeting
locally here

393
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,409
and on little reviews here and there
started pop up so

394
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,640
just II generally have then the
knowledge or are they

395
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,480
the serve on I I didn't have much of an
idea on

396
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,210
how tit to sell the stuff online I
didn't know about leach

397
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,520
shopping carts another so I dislike set
up a simple paid how

398
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,370
button on my website and down

399
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,610
and if these things just started to sell
it was kinda interesting

400
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,010
on on the a E the been Rev

401
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,570
forums II kinda wanted to let those guys
know but I sort of felt like I was

402
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,809
spanning

403
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:53,379
and I i sorry let them know that I had
this project

404
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,440
that I didn't I had a whole bunch been
online

405
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,970
and all these orders start to come in

406
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,690
and when the people who ordered the
comics was I Jason Scott

407
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,600
he ordered the stuff animal I was blown
away because I use his site for

408
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,159
reference when I was creating the work

409
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,409
on and I we're told him this

410
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:16,840
and he was like whatever did this not
any it's our can influence

411
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,129
you know your nice words not an
influence my review

412
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,380
arm so I started to kinda like shit
because my column and if there's like

413
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,510
you know 5 reviews and Jason Scott Hall
people's

414
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,860
says that my my work is crap then these
hundred books are just going you know

415
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,710
the seventy books I have read just gonna
sit here forever

416
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,830
I've he reviewed favorably and

417
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,600
a lot more orders came in and then this
guy and in the

418
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,570
bail Bioware waxy da Torre keep read a
little something and we're orders came

419
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,480
in

420
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,409
and I the guys at at the revision at
revision3 like

421
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:55,010
there's a show called the Totally Rad
show and pack 5

422
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,350
on those guys get a hold of copies and
they reviewed and then

423
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,200
more more thing so arm Boing Boing
listed

424
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,240
the comic-con their site a few times in
more more copies sold in Wired magazine

425
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,539
did a piece

426
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:12,840
to is steven levy who's hackers book is
awesome in the celebrating its 25

427
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,130
his twenty-fifth anniversary that book
if you haven't checked out some for

428
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,340
everybody get

429
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,870
a cities like all these weird things you
start having to stand

430
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,919
I was kinda like in all watching

431
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,820
watching like word-of-mouth travel and
thought it was very interesting

432
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,139
on and I was getting rid of

433
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,820
these conduct and it when I would do is
get rid of those and then

434
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,299
maybe order another one hundred and then
get rid of those in

435
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,309
just keep going and going and going and
then it soon became obvious to me that I

436
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,120
can continue this project

437
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,770
in people like there's enough people who
are interested in it who are

438
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,440
who wanna see where the stories going in
people were emailing me asking me

439
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,380
you know what happens next it's its
kinda the tease at the end

440
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,570
on sewing you know will come up to the
third volume a day the

441
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,879
its with the wake is over

442
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,080
it's good it's supposed to be a before
book series but it's really is one story

443
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,149
but each volume arm

444
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,539
handles a an individual part love the
hackers laces like the first

445
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:21,820
volume is called freak and it
specifically telephone stuff

446
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,850
I'm in at the end he gets his first
trash eighty

447
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,440
and died the second one this hacker and
deals with like the early days at the

448
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,620
BBS is

449
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,110
on ARPANET to internet stuff

450
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,840
arm war dialing and in things like that
and then that certainly miss

451
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,770
fugitive which is its it's not really a
romantic

452
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,740
portrait I love what it must have been
like for a hacker to be on the Rhine II

453
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,120
SAWW

454
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,399
arm did other research outside of
hacking

455
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,770
ass have like many couples in to to
figure out like white

456
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,490
it's really like to be a future in that
shit sucks I mean

457
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,980
I tips or to pick up from your family to

458
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,190
always at Texas or have to think of
yourself as a different person I mean

459
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,870
it's

460
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,440
you probably better off just going to
jail or something

461
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,460
& the nu-notes sustained yourself are

462
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,940
and I've yet it to put a the final
volume together arm

463
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,120
bites you'd that that's pretty much with
the wake on

464
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,919
II through through arm getting talked
about on point where that no Corey

465
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,440
doctor a little bit he sorta hit me too

466
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,020
at Creative Commons and are

467
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,340
that idea makes perfect sense to me to
serve increase readership increase I've

468
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,640
also there is a

469
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,919
is a PDF of the first two volumes on
that you can find Addai

470
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,309
at my website at his core dot com on

471
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:53,379
and you need to check those out I life
recently figured out

472
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,630
ways to make like smaller files file
sized

473
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,059
I like CBR files which seemed to be a
what people like three

474
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:05,059
arm this or to the program that people
like to read comics online with

475
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:09,240
on so wanna upload that at some point on

476
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,309
but through the Creative Commons

477
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,980
aspect I rule when doctor let people
know that I put this PDF out there like

478
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,659
thirty thousand of them got diluted

479
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:22,779
like during that that like tonight

480
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,909
after arm and I it's it's it's been a
really cool thing

481
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:31,880
on the response within the community has
been very

482
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,179
very are favorable add to it a large
extent there's a lotta

483
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:39,309
I N Acronis text after I did in the
story that if you're a purist

484
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,360
or very strict on my end

485
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,240
you know they they the factual aspect
over everything you're probably

486
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,760
be disappointed because I wanted to
switch certain things are a just to make

487
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,230
a story that was interesting to me on

488
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,630
so I'm aware that fact and some people
were a little weirded out by it

489
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,200
on and I you know last year I was

490
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,440
I was i asked to us speak at nada con
which is my first

491
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,600
hacking conference I ever been to
anything like that I was

492
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,730
terrified because just reading people's

493
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,909
comments not about my work per se I'm
online but just in general like flame

494
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:19,610
wars that would happen and I

495
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,289
with kinda freaked out because these
people obviously you know speak their

496
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,370
mind in

497
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,279
on you know went when he saw me face to
face the world they were just gonna let

498
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,990
me have it or something if they

499
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,559
didn't agree with something and I have
found that was the case in ivory base is

500
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,760
very positive

501
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,629
on though the one negative comment I got
personally

502
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,179
ways in the elevator and not a crime on

503
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:47,000
I saw bernie ask you to get on the
elevator and my little named hey

504
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,490
you know it had my name on it and I
recognize that it was bernie is because

505
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,360
I solomon freedom downtime

506
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,350
and I referenced him in one panel in the
first with the way book

507
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,539
and arm he he saw me and he said

508
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,899
to score here the guided the dow comic I
have a bone to pick with you

509
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:08,649
and I I got freaked out on

510
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:12,919
in in the Wired article the way they
should the one panel that bernie was

511
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:13,950
referenced

512
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,960
and its arm there's a there's a a

513
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
strip were its

514
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,440
it's called the misadventures of Stephen
Steve that I put in their end

515
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,870
our its Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak but
I

516
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,700
you know I don't include their names a
but I have been dressed up as a marcia

517
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,110
panels from that moment

518
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,240
I have them dressed up in there like
Alice in Wonderland outfits because they

519
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,360
work at like a local more

520
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,919
on as you know it the Mad Hatter and the
White Rabbit

521
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,649
and so Steve Jobs's is on this pay phone

522
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:49,990
tie and you know the so blue boxes and
I'm

523
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,409
jobs is talking the one in the act like
yeah I have this guy bernie in

524
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:56,220
Philadelphia he wants to buy three these
boxes from Earth

525
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,620
so bernie catches me into an elevator
and he is like you make me seem

526
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,820
so lame I have to buy these things

527
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,200
I made these things before they knew
would blue boxes were

528
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,159
and I was I was like mortified

529
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:18,110
because I was this guy's axle
mythologized im in a big way

530
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,659
and say the section of the story that I
wasn't

531
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:27,700
really didn't bike I I was able to
squeeze an incall

532
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,019
bernie as references at that point but

533
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,029
you know it that certainly is gonna
change when characters in jail with

534
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,090
some bullshit he went there but I wanted
to give at least a little nod

535
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,830
to him in that first book in SF only
place a good thing to like squeeze it in

536
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,600
and I it meant it with affection and I

537
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
with a with with with positive fives

538
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,360
and I sorta little know this and I i
think he saw how bombed-out I was when

539
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,230
he like

540
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,760
when he when he said that to me and arm

541
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,620
and I have you know at this last night a
kind he and I shared a bed

542
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,659
are hey

543
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:10,159
by not her head but on

544
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,669
you know yet we became very friendly
after that her head

545
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:19,169
I kinda dug myself a hole I'm

546
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:23,059
how we doing on time

547
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,570
wow I actually spoke for thirty-eight
minutes this isn't typical for me by the

548
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,939
way and a very very shy

549
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,600
and and I wasn't expecting to be able to
fix the filibuster this long

550
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,470
I'm does anybody have any questions or

551
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,559
anything like that's about this work

552
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:48,559
were whatever

553
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,909
up I was asking about the

554
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:15,159
future work that he might be due in and
arm

555
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,850
are you and about how that was the week
series was fictionalised

556
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,069
based on the 2600 which is all great but
arm

557
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,159
are you considering doing anymore
non-fiction type stuff for things either

558
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,960
based on

559
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,409
you know the true life stories or even
some in a more technical type hacking

560
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,030
stuff cuz I think you'd be good at that

561
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,490
I think slight and that's a good
question because and to be honest

562
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,280
initially I with the wig is a product of

563
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,870
me not being able to get in touch with
the actual hackers

564
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,880
to do I like I was very interested

565
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,800
in it telly in doing like a Bernie s
biography because

566
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,159
nothing sorta exists about him in his
particular situation

567
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,600
and he went through some bull crap you
know a lake I'm not sure everybody knows

568
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:58,950
but

569
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,819
when he was in prison he got the living
shit beat out of him

570
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,960
and he's got like a bionic arm now and
like

571
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,510
a wired jaw line in the end he got
completely

572
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,940
screwed up and and i really wanna tag
Ted do

573
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,140
a biography a non-fiction biography
about him but the only way that I would

574
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,120
ever do

575
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,270
a piece of non-fiction is if

576
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,450
I can work in collaborate with the
actual person

577
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:29,480
because I don't wanna participate in
creating something that's like that

578
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,620
takedown movie

579
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,680
that just is sort of skewed

580
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,839
and the opinion of one person and you
know for the inaccuracy said the reason

581
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,290
why I didn't do this fictional story is

582
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,850
I always feel like my comic is with that
takedown flick

583
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:51,100
should have been inasmuch as you know

584
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,310
they used mitnick's real name in you
know this ski

585
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:59,150
all rich played him in and it really
romanticized a lotta stuff and I think

586
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,570
the guy was still in jail

587
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,340
when the flick was being made in the end
they had this these

588
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,920
for drawn conclusions about how his
situation was going to end up in

589
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,110
existing fuckin

590
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,350
crazy that seemed like so on so
irresponsible

591
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,230
and evil and there either

592
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,940
in the in the was he would books like a
look at the end for the nine

593
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,800
v9r for the comic

594
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,360
crowd actually on I sir describe a lot
of

595
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,390
I S irv have and an annotated section in
the back

596
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,920
that lets people know sorta like some
other stuff I snuck in there

597
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,360
and I even feel bad about on including

598
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,390
people's names like Kevin Poulsen with

599
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:48,270
certain situations are kinda popular by
bike

600
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,520
if a but I didn't for myself here from
his mouth

601
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,910
said that it was factual and I feel late
now

602
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,589
sorta looking back on it I feel pretty
awful about then I am

603
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,910
I'm going to take that stuff out on
whenever I

604
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,029
put the entire story together or
whatever but are

605
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,220
but get like

606
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,470
II I would love to do apiece non-fiction
by

607
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,920
maybe waif with with you and out there
that would give me some sort of

608
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,900
arm legitimacy with with the actual
hackers

609
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,970
who whose stories I'm interested in and
maybe they would be

610
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,810
interest in working with me and if so I
would be more than happy to

611
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,660
by Tom you know I and I just don't want
to I have such

612
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,379
are such a positive feeling from

613
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,450
researching in and I

614
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,130
finding stuff out about the tax that I
don't wanna do anything negative

615
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,060
for a responsible with on these people

616
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,380
or you know with these people's lives
essentially and and perpetrate

617
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,290
messer anything like that another

618
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,050
weird thing that I really didn't intend
on is having like two different

619
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,180
audiences with with the way going i

620
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:05,250
really didn't think because I i just
imagine that people furry comics are

621
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,420
just people who creates it's like this
like match

622
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,510
and that's it and other people really
can be introduced to comments because

623
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,390
maybe eight years now and it's certainly

624
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,390
when I go to a comic shop in IC like
these aka Big Red Hawk

625
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,569
in Lake with these ripped muscles in
these

626
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,250
chicks with huge boobs and wastes like
this in a big way it's like

627
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,490
I it's it's too much it's like sensory
overload in and I could see why people

628
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,260
are turned off by the stuff

629
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,480
by Tom within the community that there
is a

630
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,090
a the audience it has developed from
from these comics which on very proud of

631
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,440
and on a lot of people are being
introduced the comics

632
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,180
for the first time through easy with
which I fill up huge responsibility for

633
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,049
because

634
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,160
and there are a lot of cartoonist his
work I hate in in the reason why I like

635
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,029
I have

636
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,600
such vile feelings towards him is
because their comic might be the first

637
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,830
comic that somebody reads

638
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,410
and it's shit and I don't want that to
be somebody's experience I believe this

639
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,500
is like my livelihood and I don't want
your first experience to be reading

640
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,190
something crappy

641
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,620
um but what has developed with these two

642
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,109
with these two different audiences that
the book as

643
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,050
its its it's a almost like a contrived
scheme that I developed

644
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,270
because with in the comics crowd they
find that the story is fascinating

645
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:27,080
interesting and to a certain extent I
mean I have the annotations in the back

646
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,900
describing like the real life

647
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,280
if answer technological things that I
serve

648
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,300
storefront and by

649
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,070
day they think that it's like a really
cool compelling story

650
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,850
and on with the packing crowded

651
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,910
technology crowd I'm very interested

652
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,299
in I the way the stories told

653
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,160
and I just or storytelling techniques
from my favorite cartoonists

654
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
so like in on both liking niche

655
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,180
audiences I have people typically think
a pretty cool

656
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,580
when all I'm doing is taking aim for
ants and like

657
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,620
stuff I learned from a whole bunch of
other people so basically I'm here to

658
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,009
tell you that I'm not original

659
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,400
at our but if you wanna check out my
comics

660
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,660
I wanna be I downstairs at the mezzanine
come for free take a look

661
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,990
and grab a sticker its ticket someplace
on

662
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,560
I'm gonna be serializing I the to work

663
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,680
on I decided to go back and re real
right

664
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,660
a lot of this the stop just to tighten
things up I feel like I'm

665
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,049
like as a kid when you're learning to
draw there's an exponential growth

666
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,430
that happens at a certain point where
you are drawing stick figures

667
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,450
and then you could draw passable stuff
that looks like more structured in

668
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,720
an awesome in that happens in a very
fast span

669
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,650
and while writing the wish he would
comics

670
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,700
I feel like I had that exponential
growth in terms of rating

671
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,040
from the first line to the third volume
that I felt like I had to go back

672
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,520
and taking things up so that it it kind
of like I

673
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,000
matches %uh the whole way through I'm
not saying Inc

674
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,170
I'm a great writer anything by the way
but it's it's better is it's gonna be

675
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,180
better than

676
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,129
there when I initially had and I'm gonna
be /c realizing that stuff at arm

677
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,150
I'll with the win comics dot com

678
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,460
and put up like two pages on

679
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,910
but about two pages a week of on

680
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,430
the story and you know take like maybe a
year and a half for something for the

681
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,569
the whole thing to to appear online but

00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:01,060
there's the mic

689
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:09,419
boo

690
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,660
pic am my question is more technically
how do you

691
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,089
have you what techniques to use for
drawing

692
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:20,970
and how long does it take you to use any
templates or

693
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:27,160
to you what kind of technique do you use
and how long did does it take you to

694
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,450
to make this is that say one panel okay

695
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,559
on via can bomb

696
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,660
on each page

697
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,759
of with the Wake is structured as iraqi
for panel

698
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:45,940
page kinda like the same structured as
the comic strips that you see

699
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,539
in our the newspaper and

700
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:52,819
those are I'm originally like five

701
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:56,369
inch by 5 inch squares each individually
on

702
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:00,769
takes me like a whole day to it to put
together a page

703
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:04,720
are those comics on the writing

704
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,789
sort of takes me for ever HS there so
much thinking

705
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:11,069
that goes be behind-the-scenes

706
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:16,219
that arm it like before I hit the final
page

707
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:20,349
with what I wanna do arm have today is
already passed

708
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,859
so then I dried and was like a a non
repro blue

709
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:29,869
color pencil because our when you're
playing covert op then you scan it

710
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:34,019
on ya see the pencil lines and it will
save me like maybe a year's worth the

711
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:35,190
time eventually

712
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:39,569
I've a racing on so I

713
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:45,479
each book took like probably close to a
year

714
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:49,609
to come to fruition because this is like
my moonlighting think on

715
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,369
I did the American Splendor stuff and
other comics with harvey

716
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:58,190
arm during the day arm I pieced together
with an income when all

717
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:02,299
weird sort of ways like by doing
speaking things and

718
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:05,349
doing illustration work in magazines and
stuff like that

719
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:08,779
was at ok on

720
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:12,660
by doing industry is so I would

721
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,149
have didn't have to do that stuff to Sir
live and

722
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,779
arm when normal people are spending time
with their loved ones

723
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:23,359
and while watching television or
enjoying life

724
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,219
then I it like go to the basement and
start working on my was %um comic

725
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:30,509
because that brings me the same sort of
pleasure that other people get

726
00:44:30,509 --> 00:44:33,749
going fishing or watching football and

727
00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:36,829
crap like that I'm so so I

728
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:41,049
I would love to work on a full-time on
but it is it is not a possibility

729
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:45,369
on so as it stands I each volume

730
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:48,479
has taken basically a year I

731
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:53,920
to come out are any other questions

732
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,730
USF up to the mike

733
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:04,019
i was just curious about the response
from the kinda traditional

734
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:07,339
a.m. comic book seen other

735
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:10,740
a lot of people like you said that they
they find a story

736
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,869
pretty and like really interesting and
it's sort of

737
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:17,990
the people who have decided to create
really opened up

738
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,880
there their mind to the idea of

739
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,260
when a hacker is another thing I wanted
to get across in the work

740
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,299
is sort of doing I'm my best not to miss

741
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:35,109
met is not to misrepresent what it means
to be a hacker assertively

742
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:38,640
was imbued with this idea by

743
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,609
the words have a manual Goodstein
throughout that entire archive

744
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:46,359
of off the hook where you know they were

745
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:49,848
that the term hacker started to mean

746
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:53,380
you know basically criminal and that you
know that seemed

747
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,000
extremely wrong in in the word has deep
roots

748
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,490
that that are very positive on

749
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:05,410
so there's response has been pretty cool
arm publishers were interested in the

750
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:05,828
work

751
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,369
icons publishers and its overall still
are and

752
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:13,000
they they seem to like where things are
going so maybe I'll have when these guys

753
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,690
distributed because I feel like

754
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,049
I've done everything I could in terms of
getting out there

755
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:21,670
that I could do on my own terms but but
maybe a at I don't know is %um

756
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,059
sir play around with the idea but
initially when I had this idea

757
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,990
because publishers a few guys were
interested in publishing my work and I

758
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,619
describe

759
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,859
with the wing when I wanted it to be and
I

760
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:35,190
they would would say stuff like you know
there sure are a lot of telephone

761
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,410
conversations net photo freak

762
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,640
section of the book Andale

763
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,848
are you fucking kidding me and and get a

764
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:47,450
these characters sure spending a lot of
time in front of the computer console

interested in

771
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,950
