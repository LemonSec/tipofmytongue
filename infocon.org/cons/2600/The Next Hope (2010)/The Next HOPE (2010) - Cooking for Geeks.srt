1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,330
hope in previous hopes I think they're
great have a couple copies

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,439
pass around through it but when I
watched

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,160
about getting higher some fun stuff

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,820
learned last year in the kitchen and
we've got a few things to pass out as

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,170
well

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,850
you get some treating take-home Amaral's
experiment or two

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,640
with audience participate audience
participation

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,640
said so you know it's not working great
up in a minute my figure out why it's

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:29,550
not working

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,550
hold on

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,920
will get there

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,590
you

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,890
birthday common attic okay so

14
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,600
I will get the slides up in the meantime
I'm going to tell you what's in the box

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,560
he's out

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm is a look it's all good to them in a
minute but what you want is one for

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,580
every other person

18
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,670
audience because there are actually to
test strips each skits and I only have

19
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,020
50 bags and it looks like

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,240
50 people here so again

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,729
pass out there's no difference between
the two different types that is

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:48,730
one's cooler looking

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,380
okay

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,079
cool just

25
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,769
so high I'm just Potter authors could
ever X

26
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,300
on looks I'll hand around your you can
see it looks like

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,319
that's a different Carl

28
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,739
I would call to them he's a really cool
guy and he actually the first person who

29
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:22,700
showed me this fall

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,620
concept called to beat cooking I heard
one of them to the one

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,920
else you know it's you cooking is haha I
like you guys

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,260
okay so that's an

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,160
it's been cooked sous-vide on basically
when you can it this way

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,349
it's amazing texture where the egg yolk
and egg white have come to the same

35
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:42,230
texture

36
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,230
camp plastic count manny's test

37
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,768
amazingly good on here is a little video

38
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,329
me like cracking and you think this way
to see you can see how they can to come

39
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,239
out the shell

40
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,060
on really cool thing about them from
cookie point of view is that you could

41
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,099
you crack can't drop out you know how to
do this whole

42
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,359
you're trying to skew of world the shelf
thing

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,519
on and it's magic scan it works really
really well

44
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,450
and this is questionable why is that
when it comes to

45
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,790
and a you know 30 proteins and and the
ache begins to cook

46
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,569
at different temperatures and this is
really really narrow band

47
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,709
where eggs early perfectly cooked below
to

48
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,220
Iran runny above that the overcooked and
that bans 144 258

49
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,139
when you droppin a into boiling water

50
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,340
you can imagine that eg getting warmer
and warmer and warmer

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,599
and eventually no it overclocks if you
take a hard world

52
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,620
and let us use it in water is completely
well is completely cooked

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,019
on the actually overcook it nope they're
still good but not dislike ideal amazing

54
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,849
a the question is you know how you
actually get that nice

55
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,569
texture a we know when you do a soft
boiled egg drop it and you pull it out

56
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,380
after about

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,530
57 minutes you know whatever it is
trying to catch up on that luker

58
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,370
runs up before it gets too hot but what
if there a way to actually cook and

59
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,010
where couldn't overclock where you
actually cook

60
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,760
in an environment that is about 158 and
it scared the main principle love

61
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,519
viewed cooking on one uses a water bath

62
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,070
and is in a piece about electronic
equipment

63
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,229
called immersion circulator basically
keeps water bath

64
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,229
at a particular temperature missus
capital

65
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,360
at the chemistry world where they need
to do particular experiment so whatever

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,620
it

67
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,960
a controlled temperature and in the
nineteen seventies actually this French

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,039
dude figured out hey

69
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,510
I can to get into the kitchen and is an
interesting stuff like that repurposed

70
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,409
chemistry government

71
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,530
to actually working in the kitchen if
you think about it cooking is really

72
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,700
nothing more than chemical and physical
changes in food

73
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,140
so every it works in a wet environment
from what that when you

74
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,979
works in the kitchen so this is really
probably the most successful most

75
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,150
popular things to get cooking is being
done

76
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,060
a lot high-end restaurants definitely
here in New York per se is a budget plan

77
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,599
others no I don't know where you got it
from but most likely your hometown

78
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:05,479
there's at least a couple restaurants
they're using this technique for cooking

79
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,669
I'll little you

80
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:13,680
eggs cooking I mean it is shows you
there's little agitation the water

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,770
came nixon the water upset you don't
have a secret I'm

82
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,859
it works not just an exhibit also works
in steak

83
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,169
so does it have exaggerated photograph a
normal process take its been

84
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,620
cook dispensing you see there's really
nice you know

85
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,340
grading Afghanistan as balls I think
we're the middle rare out that the calf

86
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,820
well done yeah fundraising

87
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,070
yeah make you hungry sorry

88
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,130
I'm so the same thing for stake is true

89
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,349
as exist really narrow range where meets
actually really really good

90
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:50,620
120 degrees one protein in me my ass and
begins to the nature and change texture

91
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,700
RAM 250 degrees is another protein
called actin

92
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,950
also teenagers and changes texture for

93
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,430
really no particular reason other than
just your dumb luck we happened for

94
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,570
when my ass is denatured including
Acton's native which

95
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,550
ends up being from Science Review
caymans 142 153 degree fahrenheit

96
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,159
temperature range if you thinking here
that lines up with medium rare steak

97
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:15,389
absolutely right on be a mistake is
pretty much

98
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,410
in the ideal band let's see

99
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,729
so this will greatly a tennis star
Keisha roughly you know

100
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:24,919
you dinner under normal circumstances
when you cook things you know she goes

101
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,299
and

102
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,660
outside in an outside eventually gets
hotter than ideal temperature

103
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,419
as in most environments that environment
actually harder your target temperature

104
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,710
but when you do things to feed like two
peas in the right

105
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,259
what you get is one entire block me
that's medium rare

106
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,740
whatever you set the temperature to onto
the whole thing is that was amazing

107
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,300
texture amazing flavor

108
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,410
really good textures it's great on now
of course you know you know is the piece

109
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,660
in the left side has a nice brown crust
the outside in the piece in the right

110
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,710
fingers can degrade it's not so good
looking yeah

111
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,750
so what we do in cooking the stuffing
after actually see the cooking you take

112
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,440
it out

113
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,229
and drop into pan you see really quickly
just to get outside nice and round up

114
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,050
yeah sees my friends and Jamie and what
they're doing is they're taking at the

115
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,039
Sydney

116
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,639
into a vacuum bag in feeling the reason
this is done perceive it stop

117
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,720
is it prevents the water from coming
into chemical contact with

118
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,169
food the waters only about transfer is
just a backing

119
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,299
energy into the system it's not about
actually you know

120
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,319
do anything with me so my ceiling in a
plastic bag with you get something where

121
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,319
you know he flavors banking washed away
essentially

122
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,580
also like easier to work with frankly
abusive state foreign waters can have

123
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,909
big group I'm so that's what it looks
like

124
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,129
uncooked that looks like a lot

125
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,629
and that's just a little photo me you
know pancer me

126
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,250
I'm you can do other things this richly
lost a richly world

127
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,120
you can actually see other stuff in that
bag so for the lobster

128
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,560
I'm actually did in this mom underwater
mixture

129
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,789
so you know lobsters of you imagine it
shall try to get back in sealed

130
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,568
to be impossible but if you put other
stuff into the next year

131
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,659
you can like to marinate whatever else
so this whole thing is stupid stuff

132
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,150
on you know it started out with
industrial controllers

133
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,960
which are really pricey other cabinet
thousand-dollar territory which is just

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,120
insane for somebody home on the company
called to the

135
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,610
that came up with this unit policy
supreme as last year I'm it's about four

136
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,500
hundred dollars but you know we can
still do

137
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,650
see what supreme to

138
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,329
s US the ID two words

139
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,640
you own one who's that you think yeah

140
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,338
earlier I did you mean: do things a
great many of you have no idea how knees

141
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,089
I mean like Trader Joe's sells fish back
impact in bags

142
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,579
marinate in it it's like can't get any
easier you take the backdrop on the

143
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,589
water you go to the gym or go for a walk

144
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,000
I mean thinking about that girl with the
ideal temperature the waters hotter than

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,430
that

146
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,240
can't overclock so you can just let it
sit in there for like an extra half-hour

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,130
site from a tiny point of view as long
as it's been a long enough to actually

148
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,860
cook

149
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,130
it's good so it's like yeah stuffs great
I mean it's so easy it's like

150
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,790
go trust me tried on you can make your
own Rick you can go buy a dealer

151
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,380
controller

152
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,689
drop them a couple into a crockpot
interpose on the power make sure you get

153
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,510
it done. crock pot one that you can
switch

154
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,380
on that doesn't mean like decide to turn
off and not turn back on it you got the

155
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,060
power

156
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,579
you mean so you can definitely
seventy-year

157
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,459
eighty dollars which you don't have the
Roma pay I actually went to train

158
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,520
and do that it's definitely worth it

159
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,610
so that's a really quick primer happens
if it's tough on

160
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,360
more generally why do we cook like

161
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,470
what's actual purpose a cooking is kinda
traditional stuff

162
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,449
there is you know some now it taste
better from a technical point of view

163
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,849
but the real question is that why learn
to cook why do we actually want to go in

164
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,449
the kitchen

165
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:54,890
likes it here in New York it was
probably cheaper to go down the street

166
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,589
and buy something

167
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,050
from County reference the good cost you
X seven dollars

168
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,780
you know think about the reasons why you
got me you guys like to cover

169
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,140
wanna learn to cook your girlfriend

170
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,850
K what else it's fun

171
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,120
meditative

172
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,010
dietary to choose to live in New York
where you live

173
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,959
solely Ohio you so once you ve man

174
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,990
trust me on

175
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,620
you by night so you can do that without
cooking just knives

176
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,010
on so there's a scam my soul simple
model about cooking you can think about

177
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,579
it as imports

178
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:40,579
is all your ingredients things you
actually go and buy at the store

179
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,400
cookies actual you wanna change things
slice it to some chemical physical

180
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,429
modifications

181
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,449
law sensations are like how it smells
how it tastes

182
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:53,799
can if you know what the objective would
agree that thing is pink for example

183
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,209
and their scam perceptions be things
like your motion reaction to it his

184
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,740
remains in my childhood or my
grandmother's brownies

185
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,209
like this so there's this researcher
down

186
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,470
for now any brand one thing did the
study about a thousand cooks

187
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,579
awsome a buncha questions to the scheme
is cluster analysis in

188
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:14,350
came up with this really nice little
apology like five types of books

189
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,760
and actually turned out to be really
fascinating useful

190
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,390
I'm talking to somebody about y de klerk
I can pretty quickly go oh you're like

191
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,160
just have a person any really kindly
developers five question quiz

192
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,059
which I just so happen to have so the
way this works on the run three to five

193
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:29,959
questions

194
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,280
just keep track which later you're
answering so if there's

195
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,000
fight despite questions if you answered
say a on all five

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,720
your Taipei think not that difficult so
you don't have to write down but you can

197
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,250
see one

198
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,600
on sega's ready okay

199
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,600
when I cooked meal I typically top

200
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,750
I'm good she gone you wanna see no

201
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,320
was a dumb question

202
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,840
some of my favorite ingredients are none
of the above

203
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,780
on then just don't count that letter I'm
so he did the research

204
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,730
we actually eighty percent of the
population unlike some people dislike

205
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,570
hybrid plan between different types the
don't think this is like on my god I am

206
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,290
this type

207
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,300
never like it's not exact next one ready

208
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,060
my free time I like to

209
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,130
okay well for this crowd on this product

210
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,890
F which is sleep work with me here
people

211
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:48,890
wait what yeah okay

212
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,070
just answer D make my favorite things to
cook

213
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,730
are no soldering iron references you
please

214
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,240
you don't cook some food

215
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,480
Jan extruded flick okay ready

216
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,480
other people describe me

217
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,680
I should go to the slides and

218
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,579
type just like next opportunity

219
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:34,089
okay so everyone can have had a chance
to get letters down

220
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,629
to get where you are general

221
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:41,829
okay secure the types so I'm

222
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,720
giving somebody like no shoes nurturing
and affection three like baking in

223
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,079
taking into their work you know

224
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:50,899
whatever I'm healthy somebody like you
know brown rice veggies

225
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,560
steam stuff I could care less about you
know how it looks hottest methodical

226
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,459
this is something like no

227
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,610
can make it look just like the picture
the like the kitchen will look like a

228
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,689
nuclear bombs going off

229
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:03,509
it looked like the picture on innovative

230
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,980
sabino read a couple recipes goes into
the kitchen goes i'ma try this instead:

231
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,430
you know either comes out work doesn't
bother happy with it more than on they

232
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,949
don't care

233
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,389
on last text competitive no intense

234
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,730
protectionists people like to grill
generally on a category

235
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,230
not that there's anything wrong with
going to go to so does the show handsome

236
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,899
was a be see

237
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:34,199
d d

238
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:38,680
so the interesting thing is the general
population is like 20 percent for into

239
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,129
these

240
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:43,600
so here we have scientific proof

241
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,600
you guys are not like the rest to the
people out there going back a little

242
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,319
chart earlier

243
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,949
you can kinda roughly map that type onto
your motivations are

244
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:59,750
so for me like you know I'm coupling
between

245
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,860
the health given health-conscious Andy's
well

246
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,939
but definitely not cooking that and
thinking about the input from you is

247
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:06,670
really important

248
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,790
is also your other reasons and
understanding that you go in the

249
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,579
kitchens really important because if

250
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,519
if you're like say health different
person and you know broccoli and

251
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,620
brown rice does it for you and that
you're dating somebody who's

252
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,670
use person wants to be big with all the
time like you just

253
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,809
your your by definition on was going to
set up this can have

254
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,709
aggressor type thing between the two
love you so

255
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,649
understanding that it's not you know
it's not her son from the fatwa for

256
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,089
whatever it is you know it's just

257
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,279
people have different types on sit
beside the

258
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,360
you know psychology is also
physiological differences no we we

259
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,779
taste in how we are that's where this
thing comes in

260
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,929
some people will txt things are I should
say some people like this things more

261
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:48,699
than others

262
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,069
for actually interesting physiological
reason called Super teasing

263
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:56,179
who hears her to this before ok cool

264
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:59,839
because well-informed who has occurred
the better question Galecki people

265
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,290
because if you've done it before skip
actually doing it and how far back to me

266
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,790
get with these who does not have

267
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,849
are sitting next to me who has my these
who

268
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,040
sorry back after the room consolation
prize for you later

269
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,170
so we're going to do is go ahead

270
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,429
opens up a minute of this one back
system we can catch a tiger

271
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:21,829
maybe on

272
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:24,990
so yeah pasternak answers to those trips
a paper in there

273
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,490
hand the person sitting next to you one
of those don't put in your mouth and do

274
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,379
you think that yet it's worse now Alice
T

275
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:36,170
on yes grip candy apples have the paper
that early

276
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,579
could with chemicals and giving out
white powder like and surprise have been

277
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:41,339
arrested yet

278
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,559
okay so to deal with this is

279
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,069
it's Tom is basically a genetic test to
give you two warnings

280
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:52,040
once I love you won't like this slick if
you if you don't want a bad experience

281
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,019
potentially and there's a lil candy in
there

282
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:57,309
you'll know if you need that on the
second warning us

283
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,990
technically it's a carcinogen so really
really matter dosage that

284
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:07,299
slip into anything so is the fight to
get your she says

285
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:13,329
the flu a case against got your mouth

286
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:19,698
the paper don't swallow it is in the
front on who said that

287
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,699
candy 30 she's like this it is Lexie

288
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,100
head if he horrible

289
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,039
okay so people are thinking horrible
like this make my own person

290
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,620
on the left here so you can maybe it is
something

291
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,649
but you can taste like you don't get was
that people complaining

292
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:46,040
white evil

293
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,030
aftertaste aspirin sour bitter

294
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,178
better okay an interview at the person
on the right

295
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,530
John who dislike joked is like my paper
right okay

296
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,549
to deal with this is that some of us
actually taste

297
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,330
certain that the compounds really better
on

298
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,040
there's a first capabilities that and
some others don't is that all

299
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,230
on this is guilty for testing

300
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,520
if you're looking at the personages here
it is genetic is

301
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,658
two genes if you've got both dominant
then you are super tasty

302
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:22,330
got one or the other

303
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,309
would come affect this I am slant on my

304
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,360
I don't think so by

305
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,490
interesting yeah your non texter sorry

306
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,040
not a lot to be like oh I had to my
mouth as you do it again it's like now

307
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,690
you'll know if you if you tested on so
then

308
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,250
yeah it's genetic thing on you know if
you've got both Tom and allows you to

309
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,350
test your if you've got one or the other
than your medium

310
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,460
I met you don't have either in your non
texter on

311
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,070
it is differ based on gender females are
actually more than three times

312
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,649
likely to be a super tester and also
differs based on ethnicity

313
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:01,139
so asians actually more likely than
Caucasians I'm to be which is urs

314
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:05,059
on so on a piece of paper was just a
mobile computer for carmine

315
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:08,408
see that six times fast I'm doesn't
actually exist in nature but it's

316
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,600
similar enough to compounds that do
exist

317
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,230
no different sliders on yes a tasty noms

318
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,460
is just one many thousands of compounds
that we were able to taste

319
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,080
like it was discovered completely by
accident in the nineteen thirties by

320
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
this depart- commits to expel them on
the counter he didn't notice

321
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,120
like with his lap meters like which has
better taste I'm

322
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,789
like on the researchers the 1930s start
testing on family and friends you know

323
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:35,530
before ocean like I think the
researchers to their jails in the sky

324
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,289
cuz he could just like to hear try this

325
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,639
on so that there are other compounds are
probably more

326
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:44,600
more significant than feel our car made
but it's one that we happen to know

327
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,049
about

328
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,690
missing some with the laundry knows a
lot of genetic but we don't actually

329
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,200
know

330
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,789
yet specifically what it is but in about
11 percent people's

331
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,039
it is like ivory soap

332
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,280
as we discussed this is a guy here
happen to like it so

333
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,639
its objective in this is because the
point like if we were if we work by

334
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:03,610
screen for you

335
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,419
like I'd have to know that there's
different physiologically the you don't

336
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:07,020
like it

337
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,780
keep that in mind you know I love it so
you know that because the point

338
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,178
on when it comes to fan of her car my
two dozen eggs out because naturally but

339
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,429
someone up the compound that do exist

340
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,809
without on people who are three cases
are less likely to smoke them like a dad

341
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:24,580
sugar milk to coffee or tea to cancel
out that bitter flavor

342
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,030
on they're less likely to eat green
vegetables and there's some thought

343
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,139
that actually more like we did have
certain forms a cancer because

344
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:34,250
growth colonies never say

345
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,330
actually supposedly help certain forms
of cancer

346
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,799
I'm sugar tests up to twice this week
was other differences for secret issues

347
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,200
as well

348
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,299
things the capsaicin what makes hopper's
hot moms

349
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:48,270
carbonation soda things like that tend
to be more

350
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,299
irritating quite literally missile level
to people who are super tasters

351
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,510
do my my poor friend shimon

352
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,100
immortalized in this great photograph
and if you don't have one use testers

353
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,970
you really want riders you can put blue
food I on your tongue

354
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,179
because the PA little taste buds your
trying to actually staying blue

355
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,240
you can count number dots like
three-hole punch area

356
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,710
its cover-up we have been as a proxy so
if you like watching us like

357
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,210
on a video you can try doing this on

358
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,980
it kinda works but it's kinda hard to do
but it's doable just put out the came as

359
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,090
a No

360
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,549
um when it comes to better me
complaining when it comes to better and

361
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:28,260
cooking

362
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,980
and we use of the council bitterness to
things like when I'm

363
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,220
I'm this is what's in solar tonic sorry

364
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,630
on if you put salt and that'll actually
become less bitter

365
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,490
actually literally council that out so
if you're someone who can't a certain

366
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,309
bitter compounds it is the more

367
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,899
yunis more soul so if you exit cooking
some brussel sprouts

368
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:51,000
and you throw salt on top of it thank
counsel bitterness

369
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,139
and you taste Brussels but as more
bitter than somebody else

370
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:57,610
to them said he's too salty so

371
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,419
keep that in mind to you could hear
somebody you know it's not a bad thing

372
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,629
necessarily leave like

373
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:04,639
the sole out on the table for people can
adjust the seasoning to their own

374
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:05,929
personal preference

375
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:10,250
because really are Lee genetic
differences

376
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,600
five tips to make things taste great
yeah is to just be

377
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,730
so what I mean by that is t something

378
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,280
doctors blindly follow a recipe teased
as you going to think a look at this is

379
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,990
more

380
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,720
you know what's missing balance assault
and acid so we tend to think about you

381
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,490
know seasoning

382
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,139
has been just saw but there's actually
five or so primary tasty

383
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:33,230
have a just so you a little bit %uh
vinegar little lemon juice and some

384
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,619
income of Internet at the dimensions
missing

385
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:39,610
in a dish on PRIMERGY Salton Sea I did
this demo

386
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,090
review this week with that a cheese and
watermelon that you just make a salad of

387
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,399
cheese in water in a little Friday onion

388
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:48,379
its really really good most well-liked
out everything he sings ago well

389
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,320
together but economies in the well

390
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,889
a lot that comes down to you well his
primary taste you know certain things go

391
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:56,260
well together as primary combinations
and a vacay

392
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,530
any double of primary taste ends up
having something that matches

393
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,000
with exception I think it's like better
and

394
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,550
have to look it up was a wanna couldn't
find an example for both have a good

395
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,668
thing to keep in mind but you've got
things very can have one dimensional

396
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,399
think about it from teaspoon you not
search miss Miller order plenty view

397
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:18,510
and think about what are the other
primary teeth that might be good at in

398
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,770
there

399
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,450
on thermometer for timer I'm going back
to my CV but little while ago

400
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,399
when you're looking at SIA appease a
stick your cooking it what matters is

401
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,899
the chemical reactions and at stake

402
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:30,240
the proteins actually in a tree and
those things happen at certain

403
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,669
temperatures

404
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,940
and yell to be to be for of tool to be
clear you know

405
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,220
its plan at two mature reaction but it's
not like

406
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,220
your you're checking with the best
expansion can you burn

407
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,149
and your times as forty-five minutes
like forty-five minutes matters that

408
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:45,919
matters is the central temperature the
chicken

409
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,230
for this chemical reactions so when I
see them on the river timer

410
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,549
times a good reminder hate and check out
the really using at the mom is a great

411
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:54,619
thing especially in cooking meats

412
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:57,600
and finally don't forget these their
searing you got some stuff in a pan you

413
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,179
know you're trying to see you outside
let's take

414
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,940
its conforming to the panel really well
you drop it initially because

415
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,960
well outfits wrong conforms well if you
disturb its not have good service

416
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,799
contacts

417
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,158
input as well so here nope starting
veggies or cooking me for saying

418
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:13,780
anything

419
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,360
to solicit pressing the panic one most
common mistakes I've seen with people

420
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,220
cooking is a good

421
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,520
constantly like they have to do
something stirred on saddam

422
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,000
okay I'll take a break here from in and
I'm sure probably some questions

423
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
enough had a few people look at me
before to questions

424
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,290
CV to 143 okay

425
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,470
can you overcook me after 24 hours at
1:43

426
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,960
on missing know with a little Astrix

427
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,190
some no you can't overcooking in fact
you can make really good brisket that

428
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,230
way

429
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,520
settings the collagen actually take a
long time to hydrolyze in D major

430
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,559
breakdown

431
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,379
on this is why like to comfy like you
have to cook but at least 46

432
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:01,080
hours before anything happens because
it's not literally just a temperature

433
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,580
reaction to time and temperature action

434
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,918
something will change interval after
there is that there are some types meet

435
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,690
especially fish whether certain enzymes
that are present this enzymes to begin

436
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,399
to react

437
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:16,520
break down the flash a few you to fish
you'd actually official or two metrics

438
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:23,520
fish man standing as to the nature and
100

439
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:28,730
he asks if there's a comprehensive chart
thus in the book

440
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,639
he says looking for the book here just
look at this

441
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:37,809
next question

442
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:40,490
a key if you want a really good
reference receive its top dog that was

443
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,409
Baldwin

444
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:44,639
just google to view the primer eso US
space

445
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:47,649
the ID primer I interviewed him in the
boxers

446
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:51,850
his interview with him in there you can
email me my email to secure the last

447
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,919
slide I'm happy to answer questions the
email

448
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,580
because that's great you know can have
char have thickness have me

449
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,100
time and temperature and we'll get a
little bit into the food safety stock is

450
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,570
urs

451
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,059
a little bit of stuff you need to know
that's don't just go do it

452
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:12,059
143 given sufficient whole time you're
totally fine

453
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:19,220
sop cancer better he asks

454
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,678
is at masking or canceling out I'm not a
physiologist that's a really good

455
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,280
question

456
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,510
I don't think it's actually educated
guess me up different receptors on your

457
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,010
tongue

458
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,619
for Sol the early I and cap receptors

459
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,990
it's not no I don't I don't think
they're actually bonding unlike forming

460
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,580
a different thing

461
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,418
I think it's still there but like but
that is an educated guess

462
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:50,419
other questions got the benefit and turn
black with her clitoris

463
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,520
you know see the question question was a
CV cooking useful for veggies

464
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,639
on I personally don't find it so

465
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:03,200
normally there are people that you know
if you look at under pressure by Thomas

466
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,820
Keller he certainly got stuff in there
for like

467
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,020
speakers and stuff veggies

468
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,080
undergo this really interesting
phenomenon around 55 degrees

469
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,280
celsius 62 resources 130 140

470
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,340
on actually get I'm firmer

471
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,200
the counter intuitive if you like to
carry you cook at 60°c

472
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,309
the cell walls actually

473
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,450
those crossings occur in calcium ions
the cell wall that actually fortified

474
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,830
stronger so if you actually

475
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,510
lookout and carrots in like commercial
soups

476
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,809
you can see to think think think think
can see have you know is that is in them

477
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,080
with you to get home you heated up my
the Kercher still firm

478
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,320
but how do they do this because the
notes on terbaik the carrots

479
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,700
on the ground the ground in if we do
that ourselves at home normally

480
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,950
you try prints and carrots and it's too
a kappa related or mushy

481
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,049
mom and what they're doing is they're
playing at 60°c what happen our

482
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,320
which firms up the cell walls some in
there are some like industrial

483
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,889
applications worth can use phone kinda
cool

484
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,020
but I don't know if I've like making can
see been storing it

485
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,359
usually on some are thin on if you
really do with Sudan

486
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,799
veggies is like optimistic bok choi Mike
cut in half in the drop in the water

487
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,859
along with maybe some steak tips on
cooking minutes its waters

488
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:19,580
at you don't back in CR that point just
basically kinda parking

489
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,908
and then I'll drop into pants team ever
see really quickly

490
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,270
and there's just well it comes the
temperature faster is basically preceded

491
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,280
but from actual coupon you I personally

492
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,389
haven't released anything it's like when
we got this is you seem easy and he's

493
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:34,190
really good

494
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,010
mean if you're from the commercial list
earlier absolutely there things they do

495
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,619
but

496
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,710
to kind of be on what I found worth it

497
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,119
creature

498
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:52,119
cam psyches pick up

499
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,260
economic at them separately me you
wouldn't want to vid is in that bag

500
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,010
with the me me just doesn't really I can
with the inning applications for you

501
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,039
wanna do that mean you maybe you would
like you know a

502
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,840
an Osage on outside thing we want flavor
present in the me

503
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,580
with the actual thing about marinades
and me managers actually get very far

504
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,610
into the meet going to become the first
millimeter

505
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,799
so in terms of like King the flavor into
the meat miss your brain for one pretty

506
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,480
time like

507
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,679
the flavors like a transfer from the
veggies to me and in terms of like

508
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,059
the videos themselves beautifully
written me in a pan sear the meat

509
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,418
probably afterwards a Taser medicine
that can if you want to do that but in

510
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:40,120
most cases

511
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,659
I haven't really no I haven't noticed a
big difference

512
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:50,659
put it that way

513
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,450
see are you can ask you what about the
juices from the me

514
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,720
and what to do with them all when you
take that back at the Seaview bath

515
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,290
Houston Open for the meet up there will
be liquid leftover

516
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,470
you can take to reduce that down the pan
sauce whatever you want with it so if

517
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,910
you want your mixer veggies and not

518
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:17,020
that would certainly work and a much of
a answer your question

519
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:24,020
tool for combating afterward pusher

520
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,750
sure

521
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:41,300
so you can ask you about om I

522
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,570
you know I look at it came from the
science but if you

523
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,780
and I'm to be clear I'm only talking
about like

524
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,629
10 pages at a four hundred so far to the
book itself really has a lot of

525
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,670
different stuff including have
discussion i've hey

526
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,710
environmental impact say no beef

527
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,500
versus chicken versus fish versus
veggies I'm

528
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I understand you're coming from and I
capture all the same concerns absolutely

529
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,840
Schur on well organs some more

530
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,160
other topics that are less me based on
more fun from

531
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,080
from that media thanks for the question

532
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,189
lecture

533
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,499
looking at sufficiently low times you're
asking if the bacteria and material but

534
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:35,539
back to your concerns are

535
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:39,830
so that 131 will get there

536
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,989
actually I'm how much and where be a
you're halfway through

537
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:47,350
okay I'm gonna go on to the next section
and all your questions

538
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,399
so five key temperatures in cooking

539
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,899
you know when I first started the
project at don't think I would have

540
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:56,980
thought the Sabine whether things would
come out if it but to me either

541
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,989
is five temperatures may go out these
are really important temperatures happen

542
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:00,389
ever

543
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:04,239
here them talked about this way so 122

544
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:07,519
started about to meet for a while but
there with me

545
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,840
on is when my ass and begins to nature
in me this is mainly me

546
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,409
i'm for for Fisher 204 206 degrees to do

547
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:20,269
131 this is when the highest reported
survival temperature

548
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:23,419
bacteria in the literature on so this is
for

549
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:27,200
particular pathogen called be serious I
don't know who names is things but

550
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,480
that that's in a minute on so

551
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,590
thing to remember that bacteria is
likely instantly die 232

552
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,489
the food industry campuses danger zone
rule that says you're not supposed to

553
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:43,940
hold feud between forty fahrenheit and
140 found it for more than

554
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,539
to or four hours depends on what state
you're in but the assumption there

555
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:53,139
is that you know bacteria basically can
multiply within that range in outside

556
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,559
that range basically safe

557
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,200
but the reality of it is it's not like
the bacteria

558
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,970
are reproducing like full on exactly
forty degrees in at three nine doing

559
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,999
absolutely nothing

560
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:06,999
it's much more covers curve depends upon
the particular bacteria

561
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:11,359
how quickly the multiply what food
scientists and ice

562
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,779
food safety experts are worried about is
the quantity a bacteria

563
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,669
pathogens in particular dish whatever it
is so it and it also depends on the

564
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:20,600
street bacteria

565
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,580
or parasite but with Petrino sometimes
knows me

566
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,590
as she was 55 is enough to actually
cause infection yuan

567
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,369
other cases you know it takes like
100000 I'm so really it's not just like

568
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:32,609
are the present early not

569
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:35,629
on a binary it's a question home how mom

570
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:39,409
how much exposure is there there in with
the probability years so for food safety

571
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,429
pointed you know

572
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:44,669
the numbers that they give publicly are
really all about probabilities game

573
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:48,179
trying to make sure that from a
probability preview you're safe because

574
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,809
really been at the you know it sucks to
have food borne illness

575
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:53,960
and you see be some numbers and
foodborne illness

576
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,559
on CBC estimates about $75 million
Americans a year come down with

577
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:57,999
something

578
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:01,629
from foodborne or so most likely you you
personally will have

579
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:04,940
two or so food-borne illness incidences
in any given decade

580
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,859
spike your healthy young adult male like
me but if you're you know

581
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:12,259
pregnant or really on a really old are
immunocompromised you know it P

582
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,460
complete and much more serious
complications so

583
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,010
when it comes to bacteria and actually
holding stuff a temperature on

584
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,480
this is a curve for time at temperature

585
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,969
this is from the FSAs which is a group
under the

586
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,240
FDA for are USDA for how long you need
to hold

587
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,730
in this case predicaments for mean
chicken breast poultry

588
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,339
you have to hold that chicken breast at
103 six degrees fahrenheit

589
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:41,089
for over an hour almost an hour and a
half to actually sufficiently kill

590
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:44,109
any some know that may be present and
the reason for that is that they don't

591
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:44,918
die instantly

592
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,940
having allergy like to give us a magic
been in a desert note 120 degrees

593
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,809
actually met a hundred if you are in a
desert it's only get three hours and 59

594
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:53,359
minutes

595
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,619
Evans will be alive in four hours on
suddenly die on this week as some fall

596
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,160
off

597
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,098
and so they're looking at sufficient log
reduction bacteria present

598
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,859
in particular me and arm it just depends
on it with the temperature in how long

599
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:07,549
you hold it

600
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:13,220
the last the meat-based temperature
here's 115 this isn't acting begins to

601
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,579
teenagers I mentioned earlier

602
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,260
can I saw a picture

603
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,260
hey this is really no good range worst
us really really good and

604
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,280
you below that you got food safety or
undercooked issues

605
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,930
in about that actually overcooked last
two

606
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,970
my reaction on this is really one-on-one
this is a brownie reaction in proteins

607
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,549
with simple sugars have things like
bread when you actually look at Braden

608
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:37,030
other than

609
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,970
units are to turn brown the service at
the bread is like three hundred ten

610
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,569
degrees

611
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:43,650
this is like when the best moments from
in writing the book was have a IR

612
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,280
thermometer

613
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,309
it's basically looks at service to
mature things that's like best eat we

614
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:47,790
have early

615
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,000
go get one on an acquittal of the bread
is baking like its registered to 110

616
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,710
degrees as a

617
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,760
yes science lines with reality again so
mean

618
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,599
this is the same thing on on me on
different types a cooking methods will

619
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,279
get you

620
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:05,359
into the temperature range so if you
think about brussels sprouts you know

621
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,390
boiling them like they can't get up to

622
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,040
203 sector in water so they'll never get
up any reaction

623
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,180
always have has mild flavor whereas if
you could come with the method that can

624
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,240
get the hot

625
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,900
then you're able to actually get those
reactions and get the Associated flavors

626
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,130
and last 13 56 criminalization

627
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,700
basically sugars breaking down when they
break down the then like form hundreds

628
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,260
of new compounds in

629
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,470
basically like this there is some
bizarre reason um

630
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,809
where the cool things is that you can
actually show see this reaction occurs I

631
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,400
picked about sugar cookies at four
different temperatures and at 3:15

632
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,619
Bullock have lighter blonde curly
colored

633
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:44,990
and 375 400 be the starter color it's
not like a

634
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,299
trigger point where that criminalization
really know someone turns brown bits

635
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:48,869
campus

636
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:53,099
ramp 356 up to 380 Shirley gets darker
and darker and darker and

637
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,700
you more complex and more bitter favored
but sugar itself actually melts exactly

638
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,819
367

639
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:02,230
which is really cool trick to you can
actually caliber your up in

640
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,049
using it secular lucia glass form for
your oven 350 like

641
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:09,690
might begin to caramelize intern like
the brown but she's still be a powder

642
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,349
at 375 should not much just class bill
see through it

643
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:18,559
so cool trick you can also use for sugar
into a pan and melt it

644
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:21,520
there's nothing else in there but sugar
and when it comes like making caramel

645
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,069
sauce a

646
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:25,549
in the standard players take sugar and
some water you know at some other stuff

647
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:26,790
you carefully Boyle

648
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,299
other stuff you can use the sugar into a
pan unaltered

649
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:34,150
Alba cream you want to be a little like
caramel sauce big a caramel sauce is

650
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,200
Kevin medium brown

651
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,680
it's actually really fast and easy to do
so quick summary of

652
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,180
temperatures

653
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,589
be coming next line yeah I can get there
on

654
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:54,589
are stopping here for men technique
questions

655
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,309
toughie making toffee from condensed
milk

656
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:07,619
well I'll need to check this but on

657
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,369
sugar by itself Bama 367

658
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,519
but we dissolve into something you is no
longer a simple

659
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,569
structure that you look at things were
going to promoting some

660
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:21,180
not mislead lactose I think back to
sleep action against crime was around

661
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,118
like 230

662
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,930
but for tourism doctors if your sugars
again on this

663
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,129
like higher temperature range minutes
across

664
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:38,130
yet to come until sugar Richard

665
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,160
me temperatures

666
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,270
veggie proteins well not proteins but
yeah on

667
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:55,040
things likes a Los well gonna give you a
hand with the answer

668
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,970
140 degrees on veggies are a lot more
complicated than me

669
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,160
which is why from a food science but if
you it's really easy to talk about me

670
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,779
and really hard talk about people's on
so I actually interviewed her 80s

671
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,810
for the book Anders talk with him about
this in his lab currently studying

672
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,600
like festivals like a lot a submersible
because frankly there's not a lot I

673
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,540
researched on

674
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,040
in part because well who benefits in the
research into funds that

675
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,390
it's just really hard to get funny for
some cancer research for

676
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,080
it's not applicable industry have to
some degree so

677
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,690
yeah there's a lot of things we don't
know about food really surprised me

678
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,370
actually

679
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,180
is like how little we know about food
science yet how much

680
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,640
you know it how important it is to us
from cultural pointed you in from

681
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,670
industrial funny view and from you know
earth life balance preview

682
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,690
yet at the same time you know it's
really complicated so

683
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,300
stuff like coroplast

684
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,840
I think it is and veggies like you'll
succeed reactions around 140 degrees

685
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,470
so you quarter 3 on

686
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:05,110
to fix a loose in Lincolnton exiles at
the fire and the biggest account like

687
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,390
300 thing to be celsius Mike it's not an
object in your kitchen

688
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,210
/url should say but any breaks down you
don't want to eat on

689
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:17,170
with our industrial ways like granite
and cycles powders but like you not want

690
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:24,170
got chain

691
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,200
changes in yeah changes in taste

692
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,230
overtime ok now you're asking I'm super
tasty does not change over time you

693
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,150
either are or not

694
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,250
at the genetic thing on their is the

695
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:44,420
Lex loss sensitivity of tastes starting
having early 40's early 50's and it came

696
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,240
gradual

697
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,240
with think will kids with bitterness

698
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,220
ya get there is an aversion to
bitterness from a physiological point

699
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,110
you just because most

700
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,780
business things taste better when is
camp like survival thing us

701
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,320
om but it has been that we can learn to
like better things it's a thing that you

702
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,570
know

703
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,810
wheel with exposure learn to like on

704
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,360
and it was 100 rights

705
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,840
hot things hope things are really
interesting actually

706
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,190
missus neurotransmitter called substance
P on

707
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,870
P stands for pain go figure basically on

708
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:25,029
because depleted so eat spicy food like
this neurotransmitter that helps your

709
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,440
body

710
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,970
recognize haters make hot here like its
Louis depletes in like it takes a couple

711
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,990
weeks but after a couple weeks you cash
can deplete levels down

712
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,280
and it takes a couple more weeks for
your body to replenish if you stop

713
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,240
eating spicy food

714
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,270
so this is where the stories is really
great stories

715
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,700
love Indian students back in like the
eighties coming to

716
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,930
you know United States study in college
eating dorm food going home

717
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:50,609
your mom's cooking and going this is too
hot I can't beat it

718
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:56,060
and their moms going what is America
done to you nothing are then they didn't

719
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,140
serve you in a heartbeat

720
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,810
your such as few levels didn't deflate
your replenished I'm so you can actually

721
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,180
build a tolerance to like

722
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,560
specifically capsaicin hot hot things on
something after there's that as well

723
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,910
which is

724
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,009
actually really cool on good back to
meet

725
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:18,800
TomTom TomTom you now means a very nice

726
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,800
yes I'm well it's basically me 6125
primary teeth that we know we have

727
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,070
receptors for Tom

728
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,390
on doesn't break down T so there are
certain ingredients

729
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,670
have a lot of good to me in the
naturally things are going pizza

730
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,560
just happened to have a lot to me
tomatoes Parmesan cheese

731
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,790
mushrooms the reason why I think it is
or so well-liked

732
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:44,090
but yeah I mean in this cheesecake
gotten a bad rap in this country

733
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,350
but if you want more good make my small
amount of it mean

734
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:50,440
its in has receptors on

735
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,440
to the answer question lecture

736
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,980
hopefully custom 150 on yeah I mean if
you put chicken in the oven at 350 your

737
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,410
chicken

738
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,180
actually got to be 350 degrees is a
charcoal been on with your life to be

739
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,839
dry much

740
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,620
he would be the most perfect chick in
the world sectors really fascinating

741
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,690
patent case happened about a decade ago

742
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,790
these two different patents are written
about like bikini think it was

743
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,190
baking bread

744
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,300
like one patent likely the process is
baking bread at 350 degrees

745
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,070
I was baking bread to 350 degrees and
the like

746
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,160
seen each other in court and they're
actually found would not be infringed

747
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,490
because the only ones that you get to
bed to 350 degrees which means a piece a

748
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,440
bread baked to 350 degrees for

749
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,910
like gotten with your left B&W you
cooking chicken

750
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,830
on you want internal temperature how
Jesus can be recorded as an

751
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:57,060
newsweek analysts say arm you want your
own child to mature chick media 165

752
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,710
degrees

753
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,380
input marks the reason for that is this
room that

754
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,720
well from as one-fifth scientists put it
from you

755
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,460
the numbers are for dumbasses I'm
quoting somebody

756
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,160
I'm and she justified and said that with
those temperatures

757
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,549
they assume that you're monitor was a
doubt the Mamas miss Calabria by maybe

758
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,780
five or ten degrees

759
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,070
so now we're talking about 135 degrees
may also assume that you miss probe the

760
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,110
calls pardon me

761
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:26,970
so you were actually in the call part
you may be near the phone but like

762
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,820
Justin like it cause part sonar five
degrees south can get a hundred and

763
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,640
50 degrees learning is that numbers and
instant kill temperature

764
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,069
so the what that means is it you see
chicken at a hundred sixty-five degrees

765
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,940
the bacteria is present will be dead on
that lockers thing

766
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,470
circuit that die officer vast but you
can cook it

767
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,250
what if your community look at the
industrial food processing guidelines

768
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,370
you can cook chicken at a hundred and
forty degrees

769
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:55,240
as long as you hold it for sufficient
time an actual it's really good

770
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,200
I'm cuz I mean same medium your chicken
sounds really gross

771
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,420
if you be checking you had many american
chicken by back if you could like

772
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,070
ATP your you know downs or use places
where you get the chicken salad

773
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,430
and the chickens can moist might not dry
like they're cooking at

774
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,899
at a lower temperature textually and
from what your body you

775
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,460
it taste better we have to hold it for
surface sufficient time so it the

776
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,930
guidelines that consumers are

777
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:24,169
you know the air inside a food safety
which is absolutely the right thing for

778
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:24,740
them to do

779
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,070
because when it comes to know would
rather have it is good or we'd rather be

780
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:28,730
safe

781
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,350
kinda well who wouldn't want to be safe
is really interesting little

782
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:39,730
footnote to that which has to do with
ground meat with things like chicken

783
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:45,750
their generally the temperatures are for
the entire chicken personal can actually

784
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,650
permeate through me

785
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,140
unusual Paul chickens are actually that
sick aside

786
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,970
but is potentially possible with things
like steak that works for muscle intact

787
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:54,730
hasn't been

788
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,190
cooked I for has been cut order carted

789
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:02,130
on it's on the surface that they really
care about as long as you can see a

790
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:02,890
pizza steak

791
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,390
since I can be you know uncooked

792
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,529
clearer from a food safety point of view
it's definitely fine

793
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,660
which is why you can order things that
your steak you

794
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,040
rare but you can't wait to your chicken
rare on

795
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,900
but when it comes to you say hamburger
with me ground-up

796
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,430
the whole thing's outside the is now
inside so orderliness hamburger

797
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,350
like kinda silly wanna go to the if
insiders convention

798
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,600
asking this question like how do you
like your hamburger Scott collect

799
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,500
anything other than she answer anything

800
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,690
done because you know unless you
actually fall in CV bath 104 degrees for

801
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,810
sufficient time for bacterial

802
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:41,230
kill of it you could actually really
good burger that way if you're going to

803
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,170
go through the pain

804
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,830
work on and safe be a state

805
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:49,100
answer questions probably won't answer
sorry okay

806
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:56,100
um I'm eager for one more question on
gone lecture in the back sushi

807
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:03,790
even a bacterial when you do okay so we
yet will I me from a bacterial point of

808
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:04,920
view

809
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,600
i'm concerned. aggressively on things
like tuna

810
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,950
are actually excluded by the FDA from
needing to be cooked

811
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,950
has to do with for tonight has nearly
bacterial pathogens that actually

812
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,140
but someone are just doesn't exist in
the deep waters have

813
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,650
ocean like trying to get infected with
that and from a paris that point to the

814
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:25,790
same things to you as well

815
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,710
things like salmon actually can come
down her sides the community was pretty

816
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,160
rare

817
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,680
but in that case you can kill parasites
but freezing them

818
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,759
so if you really concerned about food
safety and stuff like fish

819
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,580
on you freeze it on there are certain
time to mature hold guidelines that the

820
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,500
government publishes

821
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,780
for fish its I think -20 for seven days
are like

822
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,570
insanely called for one day on be a tune
is actually excited to sign

823
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,530
when I go to a restaurant I'd really
like your daughter made tuna sashimi my

824
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,610
salmon sashimi after

825
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:00,170
Twinsburg on then answer your question

826
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:06,320
okay I'm gone for want the more

827
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,010
oh man Africa really fast like 30
minutes left like a really fast like

828
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,750
blast through the source I dislike

829
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,110
Cup blast that out last okay

830
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:19,220
annual temperatures that may 11 145
degrees in fit the lock

831
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,290
of it you can't put on clean cycle open
the door for UPS in

832
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:26,560
really hot amateur its weekend awesome

833
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,850
and the reason for this is that stuff
like pizza if you actually get on your

834
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,180
local pizza joint and it's really good

835
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,270
black crust pizza tonight if I was like
a hundred to a thousand degrees

836
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,330
action went down to the pizza joint in
Cambridge where he live like took that

837
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,840
buyer from a letter looks like

838
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,970
athlete wherever they send arm immediate
and there's like 1000 degrees

839
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:49,670
I'm you can compete in about 45 seconds

840
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:55,020
and it comes up fucking delicious

841
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,720
but you might break your oven

842
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,339
so on the left is the surviving pain for
my oven on the right is a key supply

843
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,270
routes around three

844
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,970
it's what the US military used in the
nineteen fifties on a news comes

845
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,560
missiles

846
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,140
its he created in stable to like I think
1500 agrees

847
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,098
fahrenheit so basically I i crack me up
into thermal shock

848
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:17,760
with little drop of pizza sauce like
fell hit the glass in

849
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,760
young

850
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,940
so yet people I talk about dry ice

851
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,790
and start looking at it and actually and
ice cream by don't get is why no one

852
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,339
thought to take a bottle of like

853
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:38,450
Goldschlager next yr because you know
ethanol doesn't freeze into a really

854
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,280
cool temperature

855
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,510
the connections colder so you can make
is committed an entire shop

856
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,900
sq Mike hangover some ice cream its
really really good

857
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,880
I wasn't good enough for you guys today
but

858
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,240
I don't have a liquor license for New
York I am

859
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,359
so there's a single integral that's
basically a plea it's really called

860
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:01,950
you can do you like a griddle but so
many things hot mix is called the really

861
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,960
expensive I can get my hands on one time
in my own

862
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,119
on dry ice with ethanol with AP six inch
square place a steal from McMaster Carr

863
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,800
on basically could you call to rescind
my handy dandy IR thermometer

864
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:19,800
tells me like hold you can do things
like spray likenesses in stock on it

865
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:24,170
and like get this thing up like a
pancake where the the middles like warm

866
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,609
in like

867
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:28,020
good now that the cartons that like to
capitol sandwich yet

868
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,460
on if you look at what matters putting
stuff like many

869
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,369
are coupley over and Spain like they use
the stuff to do

870
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:38,680
unusual things meant temperature twenty
view but we cool

871
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,060
by be keen I love

872
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,060
double the and a linear and factor

873
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:49,849
companies like that on to hear her to
hear his for the term length astronomy

874
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:55,099
who here likes the term like astronomy
so

875
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:58,820
in the corner world its pre much
despised as the term

876
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,220
which have mom it's been interesting
thing to learn more about

877
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,320
pretty ciskei responsible for cleaning
the term themselves as

878
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,349
that like a strong is what you do in the
lab study physical chemical changes

879
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:14,770
in food and that we might in the kitchen
be maybe like they're cooking

880
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,359
home you have heard somebody else a
modernist cuisine:

881
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:21,859
but you know playing around with stuff
in the kitchen

882
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:25,720
in town like fashion on the Paris from
my ninety percent came as bad

883
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,109
and 2 percent it's really awesome so it
just had a bad rap sometimes eating

884
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:33,200
unusual things in the kitchen because a
lot trying to see the knock offs were

885
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,250
really work but when you see slimmer
really is magical

886
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,520
it's amazing so

887
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,290
a lot of on miners getting stuff for
lack of a better term

888
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:48,470
relies on food additives up these three
things all have food additives in them

889
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,380
she is an excellent idea on the table
miss getting the book

890
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,970
on this little video of me taking on
these

891
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:59,310
joining agents in actually like just
play with it so it's

892
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:04,920
water ninety percent water and 2 percent
kerrigan you can do stuff instead

893
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:11,920
love water you can do stuff like this

894
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,500
what we know your mind is

895
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:24,500
so this is ninety eight percent room
unfortunately it taste like 98 percent

896
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:29,770
from

897
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:34,270
to but to cut it with on issues like
forty percent eighty percent murchison

898
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:37,600
forty percent alcohol you can the really
nice jello shots that are like

899
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,840
unlike anything you've ever had you can
also email them to a wall

900
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,540
on when working with the stuff

901
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:50,230
basically boil it on this particular
temperatures agar and its nice little

902
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,270
files agar for you guys to take home did

903
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:58,020
irregular hando through it to deny could
hand out yet you get did not get a hand

904
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,370
up

905
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:04,190
okay who has the power handouts keep
your hands up latency

good source

945
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,890
for food science but thats doubles I'm I
have not found it sources for nationals

946
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:47,930
as I seen earlier

947
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,340
is when he sees a few times world has
not studied as much on

948
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,780
I mean you can get in the journals

949
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,880
me to look at for times-journal is
returns

950
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,540
run arm yeah I i realize

951
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,950
you know based on German comment earlier
that I have talked a lot about me

952
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,790
which really sucks for you returns but I
swear there's a lot more interesting

953
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:09,440
stuff in the book

954
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,880
like it's not like me having on concerns

955
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,340
I'll have to think about that to me know
and I will take up more Richard

956
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:24,440
yes helping is but confident cooking

00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:31,440
yeah

958
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,800
pitch is really important actually so
%uh the temperature things I mentioned

959
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,430
earlier differ by pH

960
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:41,600
likely to affect it down think that my
attractions

961
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,610
pH will def with a temperature that to
happen at

962
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:48,870
you can actually get down to room
temperature self-tanning

963
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:55,870
instant any stuff is my reaction
battered

964
00:57:11,479 --> 00:57:12,739
