00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,030
round about thirteen years thirteen
years October

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,189
97 was my first mine was a little early
I think it was august ninety-seven

19
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,360
and I'm as a show of hands on how the
people

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,759
attend to their own local meetings thats

21
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,380
death

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,399
and how many people have a little
meeting but haven't gone yet

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,630
a special occasion how many people don't
have a look a meeting I haven't gone yet

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,908
and having people don't have a look a
meeting but have gone

25
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,170
I yes

26
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,390
I'm we can be concerned a little

27
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,549
maybe explanation of the history and I'm
philosophy behind the

28
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,970
meetings there sorry back in a secondly
eighties by

29
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,380
a manual and the 2600 magazine staff in
an age where

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,130
I see some younger folks out there and

31
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,509
in in the in the Bakken need a teaser so
there

32
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,530
the hacker community the underground
communities the phone phreaks we're

33
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,130
still

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,430
mostly faceless on in their community on

35
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,250
internet and online activity was text
based primarily and I'm

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,190
you somehow you sometimes had
teleconferences and things like that we

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,270
use your people's voices

38
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,290
but it still wasn't much meeting up
going on in the real world

39
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,679
and so the 2600 meetings were started on

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,940
to have a nice decentralized on himself

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,470
governing sorta from sort of way for
people to

42
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,930
meet up with people that were actually
out in that real-world that scary place

43
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,379
that does have a screen in front of it
separating you from it and

44
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,470
on it was it was it was kinda it was
kinda need

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,050
revolutionary idea time to actually see
the faces a vis

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,319
people panhandles and I'm

47
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,760
I think a over the over the years many
many sorts if

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,829
any sort of interesting %uh projects and
development some things have come from

49
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,970
2600 meetings and to any we set up

50
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,680
hey mention decentralized the way they
were set up the way they were set up is

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,510
that dumb

52
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,239
no one's in charge comets 2600 data is
then a magazine that publishes the list

53
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:07,680
but

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,050
arm it's not it's not under the
governance

55
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,720
2600 or love anyone else it's they're
all products of the communities they

56
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,230
serve

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,970
if you start one we have one here in New
York on which

58
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,140
your it which is made up at a local
community but down though

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,330
the one that comes up in some other town
in some other state in some other

60
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,470
country will be a productive

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,140
the people that are there and that are
interested in getting together and

62
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,310
sharing ideas and

63
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,629
meeting up and stuff and so the

64
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:39,459
the various groups can conservative grow
and

65
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,610
change and evolve in their own ways well

66
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,860
while serving while serving their common
a common interests and I'm

67
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,360
I think a see

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,510
you your you I think you have a good
story how you started to

69
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,069
you go into it and started attending I
am um for those of you who

70
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,269
aren't familiar with me I was a member
of the lols

71
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,239
my back one and we use a seriously sit
around saying

72
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,810
Qatar we didn't have to go to 2600 can
we compete

73
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,610
because we figured that the guys were
just walking PC boards

74
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,739
and are now you to slide I'm out can we
do

75
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:22,940
what they can now how these years later
still wonder if I can still do what they

76
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,520
can

77
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,909
it took some time for me to

78
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,070
to get up enough to actually come here
was in

79
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,419
october of ninety seven akin to the
first meeting

80
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,780
and I couldn't get over how much of a
family vibe there was

81
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,160
I knew no one and Lewis had broken up
years before I went on

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,949
flying blind and I had so many people
introducing themselves to me

83
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,370
people would come up in toning my name
is

84
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,509
someone someone you know this is
dispersing in this is what's his face in

85
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:55,810
this is him

86
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,139
and by the time I left I said Anders
knowing how to turn my back on us

87
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,330
there's too much gold mine here

88
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,409
and still digging enough for those
unfamiliar lois was

89
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,800
the losers only society we figured axes

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,690
we couldn't get a seat at the cool table
I said I'm you can cause losers

91
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,400
were gonna show you how much losers we
really are

92
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,169
to stop calling us at pretty quick

93
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,320
and when I'm gonna start coming to
meetings it was a

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,099
it was it was really it was really
interesting for me I was intimidated as

95
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,979
all hell

96
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,690
um and I had already a dirty come
through high school I was there

97
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,600
fears about 1920 I am and

98
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,310
it was after I graduated high school and
then a couple years and then I was

99
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,990
nineteen twenty

100
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,530
so comforter

101
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,680
I was still have still not very social
creature of like

102
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,320
my buy online now experience was as I
said you know text-based I didn't have

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,560
photos of myself up on the net yet at
all

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,580
and I I had to expend

105
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,479
it's been a long time listening to you
after her can meeting 2010 a magazine

106
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:03,810
and

107
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,669
you know to on participating farms and
things and getting involved but

108
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,880
it was still just all behind the screen
and

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,350
I finally decided on after I miss beyond
hope because I can get the time off work

110
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,350
I decided okay if I was ready to go to
the conference I'm ready to go to you

111
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,590
know my local meeting

112
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,400
so the next month I assertive Scott at
my

113
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,270
may there and I'm made my way out there
and

114
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,229
made up a twenty-two people whose whose
screen names I knew from

115
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,469
from forum and just a just went from
there and it turned out

116
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,009
like long story short to

117
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,100
back then I was I was sort of a absurd
the brooding Hyatt

118
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,490
artist the kid in the back to the
classroom with long hair

119
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,680
and how times change um

120
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,599
and I also had like a number assertive
social anxieties and I didn't you have

121
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,610
the lowest humans and things like that

122
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,009
but done it was it was because I'd never
found something like it I 600 meeting

123
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:00,860
where

124
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,750
your people on with these shared certain
common interest with me

125
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,770
on yo living living in a smaller you
know

126
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,990
out in suburbia was a was sort of amber
said it was it was any way to

127
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,349
with it was any way to grow up feeling
kinda particularly isolated especially

128
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:17,690
when

129
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,979
all your best friends our names on
screens that you know live in other

130
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:20,900
states another

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,560
in other countries so it was it was the
first

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,419
at ice climbing was that was the first
time that I had really met arm

133
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,258
met up with a group that new me
basically and shared a

134
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:37,139
shared certain interests with me the the
parallel an extra is that

135
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,169
those of you who might have been online
in early 80's early 90's mid nineties

136
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,370
on whether you on TBS's are you know lol
compuserve whatever

137
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,020
um when you went online on the services

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,830
no matter no matter who someone was on
the other end aligned you knew they were

139
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,280
at least nearly enough to get onto the
internet because you had to be back then

140
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,240
and so you like I remember america
online profiles in the early nineties

141
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,949
your profile

142
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:03,039
like had special listings for what kind
of computer you're running 10 s you like

143
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,180
and things like that

144
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,770
and so be on anyone anyone random you
would need at least shared the same come

145
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,990
the same common interests there you know
enough to enough to get online

146
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,349
so going to 2600 meeting was like a real
world equivalent to that

147
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:18,949
okay here's a bunch of strangers a cat
on know what I'm doing I don't know if I

148
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:19,860
belong here

149
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,940
but hey you know there they're obviously

150
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,629
nearly enough to taken take an interest
in and show up here

151
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:30,729
and I'm and I I was hooked and

152
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,699
I gotta get to know people made some
great friends and never stopped

153

about this panel and this fellow
Metatron

187
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,140
from frightened try 600 UK I

188
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,850
she sent this email explaining how
demeaning fares are back in the 90s they

189
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,570
have notes

190
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,910

192
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,100
fixed rate is there and I wanted to

cuz I really felt fat on really covered
how

194
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,060
I also felt she says

195
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,260
I think the biggest thing 2600 serves
done for me

196
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,269
expand my knowledge in a very wide area
of subjects

197
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:01,630
Haas helped me to develop a group of
like-minded friends

198
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,510
and that's how I have net this is she
someone that sentence you know

om and I can I stay for about an hour
but use

206
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,529
so welcoming in a place I haven't been
and I had to say was

207
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,910
I could trace clings to and i wanna come

um so diverse strange and so strange and
unusual

210
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,380
bomb parallel I i realized was on

211
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,800
cute on sale site history lesson the
Roman Catholic Church

212
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,019
use to train all their clergy in Latin
and they were given the masses on

213
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,399
everywhere in every country in Latin
just for the purpose that when you went

214
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,810
to church in any country

215
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,670
it would be the same mass with the same
in the same language that you use to and

216
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,610
you know it was going on

217
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,810
you didn't speak the local language
should be able to go to church and

218
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,149
say what you will about to about the
Roman Catholic Church but that in

219
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:18,660
that in itself was a really neat idea
which is kind of which is kinda for

220
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,819
what's come up it's gone

221
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,269
with the 2010 earnings where wherever
wherever you are

222
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:26,480
if you're if you happen to be in a
strange city with they're no friends no

223
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,750
clue what to do with yourself in its
meeting day and you go there you'll find

224
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,260
on you'll find people with things and
not come in with you hurling to share

225
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,439
sure there's a river stories and and
adventures and

226
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,589
welcome you with open arms basically and
its

227
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,730
by and large arm but I've heard from so
many people in so many different areas

228
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,260
is how

229
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,660
how our welcoming how welcoming and
accepting it is and

230
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,819
for people who don't have on the 2600
meeting it's very easy to start one

231
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,870
I'm basically you have to send an email
and that a

232
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,360
I am the 2600 dot com slash meetings

233
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,899
on as well as the pages in the back
magazine list all the meetings worldwide

234
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,180
and to get on that list you basically
just have to if you're

235
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,870
if you're in a place that has ever

and let them know a Kayla start a
meeting here on this day

238
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,470
on there are very few rolls on it just
has to be somewhere

239
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,990
yet publicly accessible online amor in
places like food courts

240
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,260
serve on thing things like that

241
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,139
people have no problem getting to and
I'm

242
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,769
basically it's Keowee we have a large
one here in the city just because it's a

243
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,700
big city

244
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,579
on there there's my 600 meetings in a
small areas that are

245
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:43,029
two or three people have at a table in
food court and they could

246
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,519
decade tap into that they can grow they
could give do whatever

247
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,209
do whatever whatever comes naturally

248
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,750
and I think

249
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,380
I'm a big part iv: a big party 2600
meeting thing

250
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,720
especially in the early days was that
people are kind of

251
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,949
the whole community as a whole like we
didn't have things like these

252
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:04,870
conferences and hackerspace israeli

253
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,750
on in the present forms and on people
were

254
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,639
a lot a lot of people worried that you
know should we be doing this out in

255
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,740
public I mean where

256
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,269
where hackers were phone phreaks we have
these interest that the newspapers like

257
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,860
to print in big letters and

258
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,029
talk about in summer voices on the
evening news and

259
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,410
I'm a bigger the concern we get to as
admins at the website even today

260
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,000
is that you know what why are we doing
this in public why is this so

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,079
why is this not in some shadowy basement
somewhere where we can do things in

262
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,060
secret without

263
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,459
without worry einon in Citigroup the
building which we have ours there I

264
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,480
think the FBI actually has offices

265
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,779
dats when I had heard yeah yeah

266
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,649
and I'm that the

267
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,690
sorry yes just to watch over us

268
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,589
that we need babysitters apparently we
can be trusted on

269
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:57,529
but done but that the call thing about
the cool thing about the meetings is

270
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,199
that

271
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,070
you know it's not at least LSI checked
it's not to illegal to meet up in public

272
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,839
and talk about things in fact

273
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,430
it's awesome because it's basically the
the very existence at the meeting is

274
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,279
saying

275
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,480
on you know we're not that we're not
doing anything wrong and we believe that

276
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,230
strongly enough to come out here and

277
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,329
and enjoy ourselves and I and live our
lives and do this

278
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,779
and people talk about that people talk
about meetings getting

279
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,880
infiltrated and things like that but the
real the real

280
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,100
on a story is that there's nothing yup
an undercover agent a tight attend a

281
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,990
meeting is just can be very bored

282
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,930
because he's not gonna be into the
conversation that are going on and you

283
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,290
know

284
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,389
have to act like he is poor bastard

285
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:41,850
actually the entry they might they might
win I'm

286
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:48,310
we make converts I

287
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,300
at the article actually if you're fat
commoner come and see us we'd like to

288
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,240
convert

289
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,769
but them but that that the truth is that
you know we aren't doing anything wrong

290
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,300
we're doing something that's in factory

291
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,889
right and

292
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,579
Anna like a the some cool things that
have started at

293
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:09,320
2600 meetings over the years like there
been at these meetings there have been

294
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,230
no

295
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,329
you know the Genesis if things like
hackerspace is everywhere started

296
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,120
telecommuting

297
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,519
some you know movements activist

298
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,269
actors movements like a freak event hell
outta activity at the 2600 meetings

299
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,630
everywhere became sort of focus for that
for people who are working on that

300
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,439
on freedom downtime was made in part to
try standard means we had

301
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,070
we've had to you know interviewers and
journalists and authors and stuff from

302
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,300
all over the place show that our meeting

303
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,139
the as a certain film from 1995 I'm
starring Angelina Jolie

304
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,620
I am the the producer and actors will
lower

305
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,089
on all went to the 2600 meeting in New
York City for a while and valuable thing

306
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,759
will tell you that meeting Angelina
Jolie if you ask him

307
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,910
apparently she was wearing skates the

308
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,670
the on and the thing is that we've we've
had all sorts over

309
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,690
we've had all sorts of interest because
the mainstream media will see these

310
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,189
will see these things and think well
don't there they're also expecting us to

311
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,470
be meeting up initially basement
somewhere

312
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,490
fighting to overthrow whenever but I'm
18 when they come in they show up in AC

its it's a puncher

314
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,459
reasonable people from all walks of life
who to share

315
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,539
somehow minority interests on usually
they walk away disappointed because that

316
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,650
doesn't make for good evening news

317
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,870

336
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,140
number couple years to 1990 I decided

337

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,350
after

339
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,950
scoping out 33 station is like the the
central place in philadelphia where was

340
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,210
easy to get to from anywhere

341
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,140

anyway it more more people started
coming and I started inviting like

348
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,090
professionals to come

349
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,949
I would call Bell and mobile systems
which was the cellular carrier

350
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,559
after wish then and I had like mobile
systems engineers coming talking about

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,950
neier re: well another was front-page
news in washington Post

366
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,580
about up the 2600 meeting at the
Pentagon mall

367
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,980
shopping mall pic in the pentagon up

368
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,080

369
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,418
at were just sort of I searched

370
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,890
just detained and searched in gunny bags
are gone through and stuff

371
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,080
by the security guard at the mall and

372
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,360
the air in people attended the meeting

373
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,000
contacted to me the washington post and
said hey this wasn't legal

374
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,120
like this to take it newspaper reporters

375
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,799
pick up the existing range people push
back and actually investigation any kind

376
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,270
Fe make some phone calls in a call to
moscow deeply she said

377
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,480
well really was an ass a secret service
but it's up to this whole thing so I'm

378
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,760
then turned out that secret service head
use the

379
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,370
mall security guys is certified stooges
to

380
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,590
do they really will be eating and others
are documented in washington Post him in

381
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,678
front page news in

382
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,580
believe the FF got involved with that
whole thing it was a whole legal case

383
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,649
%ah and their scolded by a federal judge
for

384
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,740
doing and phil was lucky a year so after
that

385
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,130
on that we started noticing it the three
issues station Philadelphia meeting the

386
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,210
guys in suits

387
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,490
check a shout from afar they didn't look
like us

388
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,010
and I am

389
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,669
so I suspected they might be the same
from the same

390
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,520
company and I'll I can't go into too
many details about the next five but I

391
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,889
am hand

392
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,460
up I

393
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,110
surveillance photographs love undercover
secret service agents

394
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,350
picking their noses and I brought them
to 2600 meeting saying if you see these

395
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,630
guys around their

396
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,550
almost certainly undercover security
agents and he was again I recognize that

397
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,010
guy

398
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,250
to reportedly page take them up in a
ball of urban look at the meeting

399
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,790
which is right the big in the train
station every see if on

400
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,350
I'll a week before that somebody from
the meeting it wasn't me

401
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,880
contacted the local a %ah see

402
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,740
vocal free weekly and the free weekly I
get a story about

403
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,710
arm %ah the Amtrak police they're also
trying to kick it out so

404
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,490
what i think is a secret service would
bring the Amtrak caps upended

405
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,030
harassing ash on and their

406
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,280
so that's funny pictures up safe you see
these guys are probably responsible for

407
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,040
this nonsense

408
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,750
is a followed a pattern from the 2600
meeting in Pentagon mall

409
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,010
and then a I then it def

410
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,450
local Fox TV affiliate debut

411
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,929
TX after XTF channel 29 Philadelphia

412
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,340
on the local news today read the paper
the newspaper story initially paper in a

413
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,480
showed up the next 2600 meeting

414
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,370
and looking to stir hackers and that was
the meeting with the pictures were taken

415
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,960
them on your on the line

416
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,880
like what are these pictures in other
secret service agents the have been

417
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,270
harassing

418
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,780
meetings like this one we think and I
decline to be a camera

419
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,590
people again specify piece it was on the
evening news a few days later in

420
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,668
the secrets they are to be just the
stories like these hackers really do

421
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,370
anything on the meeting but I think
tennesseans because your service because

422
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:26,640
the

423
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,429
has happened in other meetings and but
but it looks like the hackers had them

424
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:31,770
under surveillance to

425
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:35,050
and we thought it was very funny story
into a secret service center discovered

426
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,250
like a year later the

427
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,559
I was alive pictures law and down

428
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,879
I found out from my attorney who used to
be a

429
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,559
Kingdom out no case but the my attorney
used to be a federal prosecutors often

430
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,280
the estranged office Philadelphian
worked with

431
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,408
coincidentally my prosecutor but

432
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:57,520
he was now my defense attorney said they
had a very close working machine from

433
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,040
from before and she told him that the
real reason naps Chia

434
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,889
had everything to do with the
photographs and and files and

435
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,580
information ahead in my personal files
lets users

436
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,799
and with with telephone equipment or
whatever

437
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:17,340
so anyhow miss it was it was if it was
fun

438
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,840
on 95th 4 was when the air

439
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,309
the pictures were are distributed 2600
meeting

440
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,649
and that's that's in it that the shining
example if the the mainstream really not

441
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:29,010
knowing what to do with us

442
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,080
and II for that sort of thing I am

443
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,290
but the don't let this deter you from
showing up in a suit

444
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,760
I here you get off from work okay issue

445
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,320
I'm gone in cost play I've gone on
crunchy

446
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,639
contrast of go get to know people

447
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,970
let them get to know you doesn't matter

448
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,940
I will say I met a lot of really
interesting people at 2600 meeting

449
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,559
I don't go anymore I stop going after
myself in our case was over because

450
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,690
I should apply to the meeting after
location for any up there is a guy

451
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,690
internet been forming in my case he was
at the meeting

452
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,820
and was get I gather he was gathering
intelligence on other people at the

453
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,750
meeting and I did Miami do with him so I
stopped going at like

454
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,929
you've been tires a couple times a
probably

455
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,940
but on I'm it long made like friends for

456
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,970
like kampf like 15 years friends ans

457
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,250
and really people that I never would
have met otherwise at that meeting

458
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,120
average be contacting good resources and
friends

459
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,149
its how many how many different how much
symbiosis happened to these meetings

460
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:35,240
run into people and then you just build
these relationships project

461
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,909
amazing has really it's really amazing
I'm I mean I've got to get him

462
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,750
I gotta get a couple my best friends up
here and they met them in meetings or

463
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,909
you know about you in the audience and
evaluate meetings and

464
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:49,830
it's it's just that these these people
who are involved in my life it's such a

465
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,629
privilege to

466
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,220
to from to have them in my life and it
would have happened if not for

467
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,090
these weird little events that there
that late you meet up with like-minded

468
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,860
folks

469
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,750
and as I said there it's really it's
really even nowadays when everyone's got

470
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,140
their you know social networking this
and therefore is all over the net that

471
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,640
and everything in everything seems so
weird and wide open on

472
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,889
there are still they're still our
communities in which there's

473
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:16,320
somewhere there's one guy in a basement
or in his room somewhere wondering if

474
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,639
there's anyone else

475
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,980
nearby who who you know it who is
anything

476
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,360
who is anything like him and some

477
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,510
chances are there is because geeks like
us African everywhere

478
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,250
and on there's really there's really no
a there's really no better way to

479
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,840
to use that and active actually improve
your life in to meet up and

480
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,879
and see where things go

481
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,600
are getting back to the fitting minute
we've got a funny story that happened

482
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,409
here

483
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:51,080
out ten years or so no someone who he's
in attendance here today and

484
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,740
say his name head one of the security
guards in the city core center come up

485
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,679
to him

486
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:59,919
and ask can you help me I'm in a bit of
trouble

487
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,030
some news first red flag and Dendreon
after it he said

488
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,408
you can trust me I'm a regular guy

489
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:12,800
and so the plot seconds does that mean
he was incapacitated

490
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,090
I don't you know that he did have a
weird look on his face

491
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,590
it's quite possible some

492
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,970
people to sign the awsome work I'm
having some trouble with my credit can

493
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,500
you help me out

494
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,620
in my friends in what year did you try
paying your bills

495
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,580
and it seem like ever since that time

496
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,580
d love to some so I don't know if it's
just the sarcasm is too much found word

497
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,760
in Orem don't know what their friends
pictures he took your advice

498
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,040
maybe it's a maybe you're going to have
some to their asses like really

499
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,250
obvious leading questions China like

500
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,809
as happens like really lame entrapment
attempts yeahh

501
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:58,270
did he mention TRW specific

502
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,120
and that the great thing about this is
we we get not only like obvious s pretty

503
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,169
stuff like that but

504
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:07,720
just regular regular people who
something hackers are what they see in

505
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,090
Hollywood films and other things like
that me

506
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,260
the cup in there like a are you the guys
who can go

507
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,540
hack my girlfriends voicemail so I can
see if she's cheating on me

508
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,970
and your bring the website we get emails
like this all the time and

509
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,020
it's it's really it's really hilarious
to note and

510
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,610
it's actually fun to correct these
people's misconceptions and

511
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,020
the the first thing I usually do is
invite them to come down to the meeting

512
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,168
if they're emailing

513
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:33,500
and I once they're there on a bunch of
us can can def

514
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,429
impress upon them what's whatsoever
what's real and what's a

515
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,690
you know Hollywood action heroes and

516
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,790
girls in cats is doing roundhouse kicks

517
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,440
it some on roller skates on roller
skates yes

518
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,330
and I think a I i think that's that's
another reason it's important to have

519
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,740
these things out and publicly

520
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,540
arm people your your average your
average member Society

521
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,270
is only going to get when information is
presented in front of them if all

522
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,990
they're seeing our hackers on

523
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,600
you know in films as The or hackers in
the as the bad guy who is asking a bunch

524
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,409
of

525
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,800
money with the you know by tapping three
key strokes at a certain time

526
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,840
its great sound effects yet with great
sound effects and the text reflecting

527
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,590
backwards on their

528
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,990
on their faces giant January lines on
the screen yes

529
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,169
and on you know there's there's only one
way to counteract on the bullshit

530
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,399
machine really which is

531
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,700
to get the truth out there and but there
we get the truth out there than to go

532
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,139
out there and experience it

533
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:31,790
Rob have you ever been to a 2600 meeting

00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,020
I have not I've always wanted to and you
know it's definitely up there on my list

535

speakers

549
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,830
what I coverage for you I was actually
my first ones

550
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,050
very laid back you know prevent
originally backing

551
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,720
I am food core right underneath the
security camera everybody's

552
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,889
as ron was saying the best way to
counter licenses to make yourself avail

553
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:58,040
was not try to hide to be out there
reagan for everything

554
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,879
look we're not doing anything a need to
an eternity farm

555
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:07,030
any sort of counterpoint to that though
is that a a lot on one thing that

556
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,210
I've heard a lot from people who are
interested in coming to meetings is

557
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,440
ya it's gonna be weird if I introduce
myself and my screen name

558
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,740
and of course this this has been going
on since the days before

559
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,369
on copious online photos but even now
there are people who have known for

560
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:23,020
thirteen years now and I don't know what
name is on the ID card and that's okay

561
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,139
it's not an issue

562
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:27,950
because it I'm although it might be it
might be him I feel silly to go to a

563
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,540
bunch of strangers and go hi I'm

564
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,668
no property Firefly were or anything
else it whatever whatever stranger

565
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:37,750
handle you covered yourself on its

566
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,800
it's it's just a it's just a fact that
the culture comment you know

567
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,899
one is not require their lets people
just use their names but

568
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:47,059
whatever whatever from whatever you're
comfortable introducing yourself as

569
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:48,270
you're not going to be

570
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,629
you know pressured by a bunch of
reasonable hackers to to

571
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:54,919
you reveal your real name or anything
like that if a few onto

572
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,230
robert was a first what year was the
first 2600 meeting you into a new york

573
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,450

earlier the first though the first no

574
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,409
one was in ninety seven right after
beyond hope

575
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:08,080
okay and Om it said I i've

576
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,780
I've missed a few since then but not
very many what on

577
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,460
who has been to in the mine in New York
a earlier than that

578
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,720
earlier 97 is Leo and you

579
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,409

581
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,030
my to do they have a spot before
citicorp to get

582
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,908
I think it was in citicorp's and
university course okay 30 minutes before

583
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:37,590
I would assume the early citicorp want
to sort of stopped but I did go to a few

584
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,510
with them here and there

585
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,540
debated the beginning Leo when did you
start on the ones in a

586
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,200
in a Izzo's October 96

587
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,649

bar

596
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:19,760
pronounce and be open about

597
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,080
solace like confidential data on

606
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,590
on not unlike today but it's just a

607
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,559
just had a different feel to it before
on yeah before things got crazy when it

608
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,360
was when

609

00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,050
subculture you know if people had not
heard the term hacker

611
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,540
and tenser different flavor was not on a

going back again it's it's really it's
really I'm been fascinating to

622
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,980
be part of the heart of the hola the
occupied the whole culture and much

623
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,159
hacker culture in general and of course
our local agriculture and

624
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,230
in no particular sort of change in grow
and

625
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,560
evolved over the years into into
something that's really

626
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,670
affecting effecting alert about a good
on the outside world

627
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,450
are are we've now at the hackerspace is
we've now got to

628
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,520
we've got things like this conference
and its it's just a it's just more

629
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,580
as I said getting ourselves out there
and you know

630
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,990
proving to the world that yes where
we're nice people we we think we're

631
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,150
doing right things and

632
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,140
we can we can on your like-minded people
can get together not everyone at a 2600

633
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,440
meeting is gonna go let's start a
hackerspace but

634
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,040
the right people will and hackerspace
will get started and I'm

635
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,080
hackett have exchanged years

636
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,920
the demographics have changed says
significantly they've they've always

637
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,910
been sorted in chaos but

638
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,450
like going going back to the early days
it was also differ

639
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,609
okay you know where's the 2600 meeting
as food court as much guys in black

640
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:49,720
t-shirts

641
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,319
and I would say that doesn't exist
anymore but turnout now there are some

642
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,069
girls in black t-shirts as well

643
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,170
and but there there's been there's been
just such a just such an explosion

644
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,850
of course with that with the web
explosion and

645
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,200
now every time there's every time a new
film k I came out for a while

646
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,410
on we got it we had an influx of people
who want to be the next to

647
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,480
next Angelina Jolie or whoever so did
she come to me

648
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,589
yeah you're seated and the the

649
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:18,759
the great thing about the meetings is
that dumb okay they're the people who

650
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,260
there are people who are going to show
up and you know expected to be like

651
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,100
hollywood

652
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,180
but there will be and they'll be
disappointed but they're all

653
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,319
there will be a significant amount of
those people who then become interested

654
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:28,700
in

655
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,850
the real thing and I'm and a lot of
those people who were inspired in 1985

656
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,430
by

657
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,560
kids running around on rollerblades on

658
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,089
or are now like relieve long time
contributing members at the hacker

659
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:42,299
community

660
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:45,920
and it's it's just a it's just a great
thing you know however

661
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,250
however the interest gets not into your
head once you're there it's it's really

662
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,390
it can be really a life-changing sorted
from to experience

663
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,790
something that we've done we've got
together outside meetings

664
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:02,270
and we agreed no shop talk and we found
much to our dismay we genuinely all like

665
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,960
each other

666
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,609
and we said man who is we're stuck
together when is this gonna be

667
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:13,650
all these years later here we are yeah
and also to random

668
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,350
like without with our meeting in New
York all sorts of random traditions have

669
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,049
come and gone

670
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:20,569
you know for a while I think I think it
was for for a number of months we went

671
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:23,520
to the Rocky Horror Picture Show after
everything competing

672
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,339
and you know did we've had like
different restaurants and

673
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,580
recurring parties and things like that
have come up and it's just been

674
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,810
there there are things going on and you
know meeting up with other people who

675
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:39,850
through the certain events on because
you will happen to be interested in

676
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,470
going to 2600 meeting is is really cool
thing and you know if they're

677
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,910
there've been relationships that have
started and also ended at 2600

678
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,279
San actually and at the meeting I i have
seen one or two

679
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:55,089
yeah I can think Ive to of

680
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:59,319
yeah we've also turned into

681
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,859
drinking group with the hacking problem
a in those years

682
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:06,660
some in some cases but like there
there's also

683
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,649
there it's it's just a it's just a
matter of like it's not it's not a

684
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,569
structured thing ok am going to go to
the 2600 meeting and they're gonna do

685
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:15,609
2600 stuff and I'm gonna go home and get
back to my everyday life

686
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:19,859
know it it really affects everything
everything you do from then on because

687
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:23,040
you you realize what's out there and it
doesn't stop being out there after the

688
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,700

things on

690
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,290
have have grown and had have really have
really made a difference

691
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,220
I went to the point of social
engineering my way out of work to come

692
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,760
to the meetings

693
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,029

sunset on I'm going to take that into
the city

707
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,430
which isn't that far cry from the truth
because he really did

708
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,660
have congestive heart failure he still
does but

709
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,629
now that I'm not there where the
creative trove okay

710
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,190
allied from

711
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,810
we got a little bit I left arm a wonder
if there's anyone out there if we can

712
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,390
put the mic back on the stand over there

713
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,190
on and people can come up and ask
questions

714
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,440
man and on time and money while you
bring in my activist

715
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,549
you can re: I'll let somebody else do
that but

716
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:58,750
he tells a story about a Serena Altschul
and MTV own

717
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,920
I please oh you've had a secret journal
their body by

718
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,980
alright know is that three now chola a
lot of you might be familiar with the

719
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,130
MTV fiasco

720
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,060
which to had its own had its own panel
and I think its UK

721
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,690
to explain what their its UK to rather
with dont explain what the hell happened

722
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,170
and that was the case if ntv on sending

723
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,680
on who was then an MTV News reporter
Serena Altschul to our meetings to

724
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,970
K get a handle on what we're all about
and

725
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,330
of course at that time the free Kevin
nom movement was in full swing and we

726
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,140
need all the help

727
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,620
exposure we could get so so a lot of us
thought okay you know

728
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,950
its MTV MTV sucks whatever but maybe
this'll maybe it's a good thing for us

729
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,520
and I'm so they came down to the
meetings and of course

730
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,350
it is a public place so any journalists
are welcome to come down and

731
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,810
and do whatever but Tom it's always
funny to watch it watch when it happens

732
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,270
and

733
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,980
they come up and hacker culture I think
as a result of this became a lot more

734
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,650
media-savvy

735
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,540
as a result of this particular fiasco
and others like it where on

736
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,940
you know if if someone comes up and you
know they're their journalist on the TV

737
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,230
and how would you like to be on the TV
and talk to us

738
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,029
if people are not as immediately willing
to

739
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:13,510
go and make for themselves just because
it's just because it's for TV

740
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,440
but Tom I'm she I'm sorry algal ended up
for interviewing a bunch people someone

741
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,170
video on my declined to be on video but
I chatted with her but she seems genuine

742
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,130
enough

743
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,109
on seems genuine enough and like of
course a

744
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,940
7 months later we we were pretty we were
presented with Tom

745
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,460
a documentary which was followed very
stupid people saying stupid things and

746
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,120
MTV taking all seriously and spectating
into this big scare mongering piece a

747
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,130
crap

748
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,910
and the the fact that that happened
kinda from

749
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,220
I think that was sort of a turning point

people who

760

761
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,240
the stock from

762
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,690

it they had like everything down to a
scene ever couple kids passing a floppy

yes

767
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,080
um the plan was that a the marine act a
home movie hackers

768

for our onto each flight thing so the
other than a hand over that this is a

769
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,370
guy

770

riding a skateboard while being drank
while im

771
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,080

savage life is only half an hour

772
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,670

persian yeah yeah after

775
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,200
but did but that was that really
affected done how how the

776
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,000
hacker community viewed as view the
media at that point but I'm as far as it

777
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,130
relates to 2600 meeting said

778
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,259
it's a it's an example if we had we've
had we've had sort of

779
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:28,830
media and journalism things come to our
meetings and had it turned out well

780
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,819
we've had there is a there was a
brilliant a Norwegian film student time

00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,870
natan day acoustic Leinart Sorensen

782
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,270
on who made a film called New York City
hackers on which is

783
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,770
somewhere out there on on his website
and that was from their meetings and it

784
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,370
was it was

785
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,009
it was a pretty decent desert attacked
short film documentary on we've had a

786
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:48,440
Japanese business

787
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,609
action novelists to whose name I don't

788
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,509
on care to try and pronounce on church
up and all these all these different

789
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:58,049
people who are these are mainstream
people who are interested in what's

790
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:59,140
really going on

791
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,799
and on who we're all too happy if not
everyone is willing to be on camera but

792
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:04,730
we're all too happy to try and educate
people on

793
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,420
on what sir over really all about and
I'm I think we have a couple questions

794
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,520
so if

795
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,660
you like it yeah I'm Ivan I'm

796
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,020
i subscribe to a magazine I come I've
been coming to hopes setting 2002

797
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,520
but I worked family you no obligation I
seventy you know you talked about

798
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,700
counter talked about you know I had a
socially engineer myself to

799
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,080
to get outta work you know in I mean of
course I can't do that so

800
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,890
for me it's a conflict in you know I'm I
guess I for myself is party

801
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:38,330
the but I called the silent majority up
geeks and nerds I i sat on the IRC an

802
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,779
attic as I don't have time

803
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:42,920
on because I wife kids every cell arm

804
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,069
what do you recommend for people such as
myself when I just can't make the time

805
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:47,750
so you're

806
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,620
interact with that of course am we're
all having all of us are leaders in our

807
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,640
own respective areas in zone so

808
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,040
it's great in Iraq with the folks but I
just can't you know I

809
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,730
make the time to do that and so just
curious what your fault

810
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,609
I don't think under has the copyright on
his serve friend with a blood

811
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:04,940
transfusion story

812
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,040
9 production it would say on in a case
like then

813
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,190
get together on the weekends yeah on the
the reason

814
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,799
the reason that I study meeting is a
specific your day is basically for as we

815
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,290
were saying before you go anywhere and
find a meeting

816
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,310
on but there there have been I don't
know if they're

817
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,210
been any cases where it's been on a
different day I mean there there a

818
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,960
temporary cases where like it's on a
holiday or something so we have the next

819
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,859
week but

820
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,920
but Tom it's a it's really

821
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,480
it's really I think that's one of the
few pieces over standardization that

822
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,350
apply but

823
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,130
on as far as as far as like people who
work in the day on

824
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,730
some people will start the meeting and
of course that I think the time the

825
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,480
official time

826
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,740
it starts as white 5 p.m. yet but Tom
you know

827
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,920
ours is ours will outlast until people
start leaving

828
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,190
the food court at around eight or nine
ish and

829
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,410
you know get those in other places may
may get going later they may start later

830
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:56,890
they

831
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,950
%um them and later and so that admit in
that sense the

832
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,990
the actual time it starts can can be
adjustable to what's best for on

833
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,299
I remember did back in

834
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:10,640
late 80's early 90's allotted add lot
other Midlands

835
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,730
in back 2600 for the meetings I'll put

836
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,859
the year pay phone numbers from where
the meeting

837
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:20,299
you already talk about this tennis at
nine and okay yeah we put it like

838
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:23,210
30 station to pick up a phone number
that was in the first inning your

839
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,810
meeting start had paid for numbers

840
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,819
because I am before most people hate
email accounts

841
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:32,549
late eighties %ah early anyway so you
would you call people but the problem is

842
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:33,859
in other time zones

843
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:38,040
it was insane you just call you can call
later or earlier depending on where

844
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,900
you're calling the world our country

845
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,160
and that was me as you could we have
people like

846
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,589
it it bro to pay fans calling

847
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:51,120
sometimes rate boxes tumor to other a

848
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,170
meetings that were in that same times
and it could have been 100

849
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:58,240
out house miles away and just for doing
some networking between meetings hey

850
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,810
what's going on in your meeting

851
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,430
and ima people in Africa self engine
then either

852
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,520
so interesting also backed the question
regard to

853
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,720
if you don't have time to go to a
meeting and you have kids depending on

854
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,620
their age group

855
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,960
there's I'm not picking earlier today s
are some kids with fam

856
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,960
adult supervision learning soldering on

857
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,259
show if you have time to hang out kids
became coaching meeting

858
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:25,779
you can bring that kind education into
the home as well

859
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:28,560
and there also are people who bring the
kids to the meetings and you know

860
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,400
sometimes the parents are involved
sometimes parents on the side and just

861
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,980
watch the crazy kid deftly with his
computer friends

862
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,609
but damn it's a it really is like

863
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:41,520
another another factor having a public
places on school kids can go

864
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,100
on you know day there's really no

872
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,490
was because you're using is are those he

pretty sure it's the same guy

880
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:44,060
like months and months later where I
work

881

899
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,210
to 20:20 bat handle on people like this
who were

900
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:48,170
sorry if I'm taking an interest but are
not interested in being part of the

901
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:48,779
meeting

902
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:53,350
%um just came a little wave well i I
swear I'm only mildly paranoid

903
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:57,339
yeah oversight like that necessary that
that's also another that's also another

904
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:59,660
point of having these things out in
public rather than

905
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,770
like at somebody's house where you know
as as with anything else in public I you

906
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,859
can use your judgement dunno

907
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:09,040
on on things like go you talk to and
what you tell them

908
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,940
arm also was it actually illegal to take
pictures are these people

909
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,299
if you're in a public place i mean i
wages in public come

910
00:50:17,299 --> 00:50:20,880
I am I'm no lawyer and of course follows
me very steep by stater

911
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,799
place my place but as far as I know
around here if you're in a public place

912
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:25,540
it on an expectation of privacy in your

913
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,930
her Europe into being photographed yes
no it's not illegal

914
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,250
yeah but they will get in any way sayegh

915
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,859
going back and forth he can guy can

916
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:38,970
okay when you can get on my behind him
and we can keep probably

917
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,290
up yessir you mentioned some traditions
that

918
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,430
2600 Hannah just one to hear few more

919
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,859
them okay for on for

920
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:52,339
for a little while after our meeting
some there

921
00:50:52,339 --> 00:50:55,339
there was a lot of Brooklyn that with
her party is Sun they were known as

922
00:50:55,339 --> 00:50:57,100
actor halfway house

923
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,630
from and does you know for Left parties
but of course babe by then

924
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,279
them you know the official app the
official for input event is a and didn't

925
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:05,160
like I said

926
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,040
you know you you can you gotta use your
judgement day went on to better their

927
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,950
house

928
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:13,900
but I'm no we we were mostly resort
about loosely knit group and we would go

929
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,109
do that or you know we've we've ended up
at different restaurants some

930
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:21,279
over the years restaurants have um when
we when we've gone it's dinner after

931
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:22,730
meetings there have been no the whole

932
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,759
spectrum love receptions where like week
week weeks ago some Chinese restaurant

933
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:29,140
that would give us the whole top floor
the place because you know we're a big

934
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,509
group meet up well

935
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:33,880
on but then there have been restaurant
again Sicamous unlike me the food worse

936
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,080
and worse in the service worse and worse
until we at

937
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,950
until we pick another place on but Tom

938
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,190
as as far as a as far as other things go
like just

939
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,500
um also it's a assertive

940
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,660
strange like their been there been
people have gotten together outside have

941
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:53,170
outside the meetings to now back in the
days have

942
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,079
trashing and things like that people
would I get together for field trips or

943
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,140
like people got together and torn a
toward a essential officer

944
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,049
things like that and you know gunships

945
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:09,520
as a do for now set their I'm sidebar
gonna hang around that

946
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,780
your choices and meetings and freed up
by the way um

947
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,980
my focus is that it's very interesting
which i think is for the say

948
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,640
the term hacker culture because I know
that there's a bunch of people

949
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm glad to refer to the hackers the
hackers Skeen I think they're

950
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,950
actually like that perception
definitions like two completely

951
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:30,829
different things and and some I'm a
conflict is like

952
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:35,589
um yet sir balance where you have people
on their way you want it to be more open

953
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:38,680
but then you have the thing we have
these people who they feel like they're

954
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,319
in their niche

955
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:42,839
they like their niche they see it
spinning its not coming in it anymore

956
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:46,750
in a day they they're kinda protective
it up for quick story example at your

957
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,530
tweets 100

958
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,780
have a complete confirmed three years
but when I showed up

959
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,069
that you guys are nice and people here
word nice but there is people who are

960
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,829
really good people but they just work
talking to each other because I you know

961
00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:57,290
arian

962
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,200
that their their own thing and they all
got their own clicks and when I so that

963
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,010
they can stir because I saw the same
type things online

964
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,500
so I started rearranging all the tables
and chairs

965
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,250
arm so that people be faced with each
other and actually a good people like

966
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,690
but the hell are you doing I like

967
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,450
I'm for together it's like your they
won't talk to us they can bring their

968
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:16,950
own dangers up but the thing is no one
was that's why did it and people

969
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,440
actually did start of each other and
people search from projects and stuff

970
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,720
i think thats like a very important
things like being together says yeah

971
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,630
is about and I think a as a I i think i
think that's a very good point and of

972
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:29,250
course like

973
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:33,050
like any community has a to has a Tom

974
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:36,500
adolescence or whatever on their there
have been cases I know it

975
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,510
our meeting and I'm not gonna call
anyone out on it because some people are

976
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,380
good people

977
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,980
but there have been cases have like a
clicks developing and people just sorta

978
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,849
aware the pool table in juneau

979
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:49,960
whatever but Tom the really the real
elitist assertive

980
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,550
you know we're cooler than you were
better than you type of people on

981
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,609
don't tend to actually last long at the
meetings because it's not there

982
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,950
it's it's just not the right place for
them and eventually eventually I get

983
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,290
into that when

984
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:06,319
just because they don't talk to anyone
knows talking to them so

985
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,400
it's it's really that the most
successful

986
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,740
like like any like any community on now
we've been going well we've seen it

987
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,660
assertive ebb and flow and go through
its active and slow periods and thanks

988
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:21,720
but Tom but like anything else it's it
had its owner is how it I'm going to do

989
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,950
and you know once it does it it finds

990
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,880
the best direction like any other
Saturday evolution it find the best

991
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,290
direction it goes in it

992
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:33,569
and we found that we found our meetings
have really grown into sort of a really

993
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:34,440
inclusive

994
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,790
from you know friendly open culture and

995
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:40,900
know anyone who wants to attend their
local meeting and

996
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,260
or perhaps start when with where none
exists I'm it's very

997
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,740
it's very easy to do so and it can be
ultimately

998
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,359
on extremely rewarding and I just like
to encourage of you out there too

999
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:55,119
see what's going on in your local scenes
or maybe make something happen in your

1000
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,430
local scenes

1001
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,960
and I think where I think we're just
about out of time so a

1002
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,970
and I think you all for coming and

1003
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:07,720
his arm if you're if you're interested
2600 accomplish meetings

1004
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,170
thank you very much
