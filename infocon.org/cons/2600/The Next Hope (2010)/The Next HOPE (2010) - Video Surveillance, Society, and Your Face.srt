all sorts of fun stuff so please I'll
listen to the radio show radius that was

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,160
done a great job

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,019
a bunny who I think you're mention last
talk is down there typing your fingers

11
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,000
off on IRC

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,550
a and just having a good time anyway
let's get to it

13
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,559
so first question of people ask is a who
the hell you

14
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,040
and I like to discuss that because a I'm
pretty much kind of a weirdo

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,019
which nevermind anyway I'm an ex-cop on
the next fireman

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,010
I've been doing video surveillance for
years I don't actually do that much

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,629
anymore

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,000
professionally but I handled a lot of
Vegas casinos

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,219
%uh Indian casinos out west prisons

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,350
pretty much you name it from literally
people's houses

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,710
for very very rich people's houses
burials

22
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,989
all the way up to Vegas casinos like I
said so

23
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,030
I i've done video surveillance done fish
on what except on

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,729
official recognition face tracking all
that's what a fun stuff I was actually

25
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:10,760
around when they started

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,090
installing it in separate appliance
boxes before the integrated into

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,350
all the video surveillance boxes there
are now so it's it's

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,570
I kinda grew up with it a little bit and
it's a lot of fun that's why I cannot

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,740
make it a hobby sahnoun

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,490
my hobby it my work is standing over
computer all day some I have

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,670
my happiest to but anyway I'll

32
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,880
I've also well as you can see I've done
just about everything to a blacksmith

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,920
I was having done that in a while I'm
I'm register first dentist yes

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,189
just trust me on this I i've done just
about everything

35
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,329
people actually hire me just to see my
resume its its

36
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:48,040
really funny but I should tell you that
the company I work for now

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,950
is not sponsoring the stock I work for
whitehat security right now

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,189
and I i had to put this in because
they're like my god what are you talking

39
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,390
about like just its cool

40
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,790
to worry about this is not I'm I'm gonna
read this forgive me I try not to rate

41
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,350
my slides this is not a white hat
security presentation

42
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,899
the slides ideas opinions and jokes are
all just for pets trust me they're bad

43
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:07,979
jokes that whether mine

44
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,540
and should not be taken to be related in
any way shape or form is wet securities

45
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,000
because Jeremiah Grossman told much
better job than I do so in the future my

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
I understand that art let's get to the
me to the matter

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,790
this told this talk about video
surveillance

48
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,179
and how it actually affects you now let
go of slide for sale here

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,200
a lot of people that I hang out with you
guys

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,610
are amateur or semi-professional or
professional photographers videographers

51
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,050
we record our existence we report our
our our lives we have fun

52
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,090
I mean a lady at it was just talking
about how

53
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,879
she has camera wifi card justice and
everything to the block everything to

54
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,179
the Twitter everything here every

55
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,459
it goes out man we r we're livin life
public right

56
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,670
so that's where the summit talks here
but privacy that's what this only talk

57
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,269
here about

58
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,129
all the different ways that your life
can be public it still retains some

59
00:02:59,129 --> 00:02:59,768
privacy

60
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,080
or if you wanna go of all public should
go for the full monty whatever

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,370
whatever your choices but we tend to
report our lives I mean

62
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,470
who here has a digital camera pretty
much

63
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,930
okay who here has a you know camcorders

64
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,080
did security systems other digital
beside your primary digital camera yeah

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,730
a lot of people so how can that affect
your life

66
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,090
and that's why i wanna talk about so
this is the perception a video

67
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,200
surveillance today

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,700
there's a guy with a camera looking over
the cubicle wall at you going hey I'm

69
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,180
gonna find out what your own

70
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,340
it's not true that's what used to be
this is the reality

71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,790
very sophisticated systems okay the
systems contract you

72
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,959
follow you want you know who you are I

73
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,940
it's pretty scary okay that that that
makes sense there's some limitations

74
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,599
actually doesn't know who you are and
what you been enrolled in the system

75
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,769
and it takes a lot more to enroll
someone in the system than you think

76
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,629
if you watch like Las Vegas the show the
like I video like you're the guy and

77
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,530
they find it like 50 force the way

78
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,549
six seconds later and you're like no
trust me it doesn't work that way

79
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:08,470
but it is getting cheaper to do is
getting easier to do

80
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,569
I and I'll hour for beckley at a will
tell you that as

81
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,570
a silicon gets more advanced amateur
features from higher great start coming

82
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,810
down the a commoditized

83
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,269
okay so how is it being used today

84
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,850
well on force me is on the way so that
this guy actually was arrested

85
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,380
because official recognition technology
okay a

86
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,699
and by the way you'll notice I I am
courting all my sources

87
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,580
so I'm I'm properly citing everybody I
got busted

88
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,870
a.m. the last talk if anybody knows move
X

89
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,580
use on his pictures and even realize it
is like that's my picture held up Sipho

90
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,969
to just be the picture so I

91
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,110
I'm citing everybody XO if you see any
of your stuff in here at it and say just

92
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,550
tell me

93
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,590
affects says law enforcement use facial
recognition facial expression technology

94
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,790
although they caught a guy and if you
live in any state

95
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,900
that has a a facial recognition coming
in like delaware

96
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,669
they actually use facial recognition in
there there in the process

97
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,240
the check you against the wards list
there are other states that have

98
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,080
different rules I really don't want him
smile at me

99
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,940
in any way shape or form up but a lot of
them require the no smile rule and the

100
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,009
reason is because

101
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,650
facial recognition software is very a

102
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,860
very strict your face is made up of
polygons

103
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,180
if you're not smiling every picture is
not smiling

104
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,870
they have a baseline okay if you the
picture you're smiling

105
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,100
your face is changed we get more than a
bit but that's where they say that a

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,900
smile

107
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,949
anyway I just want to show you what
people are doing these days a

108
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,370
again in Vegas they arrest the guy based
on facial recognition at the DMV

109
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,800
%uh in California face recognition
suffer for the DMV

110
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,289
do you get the trend here people okay

111
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,469
what's going on is that it DMV's there
going hey with that the school data

112
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,759
bases everybody's faces got a driver's
license

113
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,470
let's take them the FBI actually did it

114
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,900
on their more DMV good lord more DMV

115
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,300
oh wait the FBI the FBI is taking DMV
photos

116
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,620
and they try it if this was a things
North Carolina North Carolina

117
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,830
they actually took it and ran it against
every day in the photo against their

118
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,639
a ten most wanted against the fugitives
list lisette pays anybody in there that

119
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,220
we worked

120
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,130
and I don't believe the car anybody from
that they got this one guy but it wasn't

121
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,780
their list it was like a stateless that
access to

122
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,240
I respectively that was a test and if
anybody did catch that

123
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,780
that was a text effectively within the
next few years there was a huge privacy

124
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,090
a

125
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,919
up for about this by the way anybody
remembers it was i to think about your

126
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,900
torso

127
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,770
up but it the FBI was looking to see not
only can we catch somebody based on this

128
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,380
well anybody care wanna be careful take
every state DMV photo

129
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,909
and effectively create a database every
person's face at least everyone with a

130
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,470
driver's license

131
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,440
and so I'm guessing most everybody hears
a driver's license

132
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,440
unless you live in new york city in
which case you like when it's a car

133
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,880
pretty much exactly correctly the
question is the gentleman is the mic was

134
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,430
that

135
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,289
even if you don't have a driver's
license a lot of places you need some

136
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,960
form a photo ID and a state-issued photo
ID is the cheapest easiest way to get it

137
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,099
guess what it took a photo okay so even
if you don't have a driver's license

138
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,380
have a state-issued photo ID

139
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,389
thank you very much appreciate that so
he's got a good point

140
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,340
so what happens when the FBI as
everybody space and a nice little

141
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,479
database

142
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,389
and K we got video the crime that
happened last night

143
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:38,060
you know your face matches which men
coming in for questioning police

144
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,169
I'm not really great about that let's be
honest here okas

145
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,789
just a little detail free but you know
it's interesting because

146
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,090
official recognition which was is seen
as law enforcement

147
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,650
to love the future you know Dick Tracy

148
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,150
you know it pick up your watchin look
for the face

149
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,840
feel like us. face ice were together do
that was Vegas like a week but anyway

150
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,389
it's gotten so cheap you can actually do
it online

151
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,770
I mean this is your presenter

152
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:14,650
who use this the this call morph program
to the side what do I look like

153
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,259
if you change my race so I did a couple
other this this one was really funny

154
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,419
like this one

155
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:27,419
um this one also is very funny and it's
remarkably correct actually

156
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,770
what's that the thank you there

157
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,769
her for she will vouch for that reason
be that way to it's quite funny it is

158
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,990
remarkably correct they they have a
great idea what happens and it's

159
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,310
interesting because you left in your
allies with that

160
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,589
II literally did this I'm laughing like
I it's great I'm like well that really

161
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:49,130
does look like me when I'm drunk and I i
went back I took a look at what they do

162
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,640
and I realized that they actually

163
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,069
got a lot of people drunk and took
pictures on and changed they realize how

164
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,230
the face changes from

165
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,529
sober to drunk from be

166
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:05,050
to make a and then so that they can do
that is use that data and extrapolate

167
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,540
what you will look like when you're
drunk

168
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,589
they can use that data and extrapolate
will extrapolate what you will look like

169
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:10,910
when you're different race

170
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,719
bill extrapolate what you look like when
your upset happy

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,920
Matt murderous rage

172
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,149
is always to do this interesting now I

173
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,390
there's the shows like lie to me and I
don't believe that's tougher not that

174
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,069
outside the scope what we're talking
about okay I'm not certain emotions and

175
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,800
can you detect if he's lying or not

176
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,500
i'm talking about. when you smile you
look a certain way

177
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,649
when I'm drunk I lookin slur my words a
certain way

178
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,980
and you can extrapolate that from day to
day right okay so

179
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,370
it's getting cheaper to figure out and
do facial recognition

180
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,589
the silicon is getting cheaper it's
getting easier this filtering down for

181
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,910
the price levels if that makes sense

182
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,610
so I mean there there's amazingly stupid
things out there

183
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,810
like you can put in yourself and your
best friends picture and see what a baby

184
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,459
will come out as long as you want to pay
the cell charges $9.99 a month

185
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:09,790
so I didn't feel like doing it so I just
took it to picture the slide

186
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,870
but that's kinda cool I mean you can
morph the two people together you can

187
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,690
always do that but they've starting to
get enough data that in critical mass

188
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,589
they can really do it pretty well summer
silly but

189
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,970
will get that the second they also have
this amazingly stupid things

190
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,470
something don't work at all because
according to this um

191
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,720
let's see I look sixty percent like
person daily

192
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,930
and 50 percent like Christie Brinkley

193
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:41,050
you there I i'm fairly sure no one would
dumb mistake me for Christie

194
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,540
Christie Brinkley I just my for

195
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,290
torture just my personal thoughts and
sometimes it's actually kind of cute

196
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:55,290
I had to include this I thought it was
hilarious

197
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,510
and that's actually from a celebrity
look-alike program and

198
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,060
I'm not going there I have nothing about
political views my presentation

199
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,000
I am NOT stating that the GW looks like
entering a tank or acts like one

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,029
or in any way shape or form nevermind

201
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:17,410
yes from Bleacher ok anyway so

202
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,579
but very seriously they actually have
interesting machines out there i read

203
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,490
into this I i teach

204
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,660
occasionally whatever their airport
decides to throw me a class

205
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,620
at Saint John's University in Staten
Island and I ran into this in the

206
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,990
cafeteria and I was like wow this is
really cool

207
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,399
this is just a machine that they built a
cool-looking kiosk it looks like a death

208
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,029
row machine it's very

209
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,670
but inside it's just a kiosk computer I
was like no this is disappointing

210
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,680
um I was like you know ray guns and shit
anyway

211
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,399
um but what it does is you sit there and
it takes a picture your face their

212
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,300
webcam

213
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,240
you align your eyes okay it to it but
that these

214
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,720
across is on the rise but this is the
court is a mouthful the block

215
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,279
and it'll change a race for you this is
one person I I decided to use their

216
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,260
exemplar that this is the same person

217
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,740
with their race change to different
thinks so I mean not only is that online

218
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,010
stupid stuff

219
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,829
but it's really it's getting out there
to try to educate people about different

220
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:09,750
races about

221
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,050
year how to be nice to each other you
know kabayan that's great that's

222
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,010
wonderful

223
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,579
but the idea is we're using facial
recognition technology everyday uses

224
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,139
besides 14 spaces

225
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,149
the really fascinating to me I really
like how it's gotten so cheap and so

226
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,579
easy it's done software not in special
appliances the cost

227
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,010
and I bought one once for a casino that
was a hundred fifty thousand dollars

228
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,290
this just three points of the video
surfaced okay

229
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,800
I mean this is awesome stuff but that
means that it's getting cheaper

230
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,850
it's getting easier it's going to be
easier to do to you

231
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,240
okay that's a problem isn't

232
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,040
could it be will yeah i mean but anyway
I got a couple other

233
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,680
uses back in 2006 they had facial
recognition technology but this was like

234
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,740
150 thousand her take her fifty thousand
dollar teen there's a smart house

235
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,079
and it would recognize you the door go
hi how you doing so Josh

236
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,510
mister Josh your home please come on
here

237
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,600
but nowadays it's in my camera that's
the camera I just bought

238
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,050
that camera when you walk away get only
the self-timer because when you set it

239
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,730
on a tripod and walk back in

240
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,610
you know hug everybody you wouldn't get
it to take the picture

241
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,829
I was like no all and the guy at Best
Buy was like let me show you this is

242
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:25,440
cruel

243
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,720
we've got stoners demonstrating facial
recognition technology now

244
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,110
awesome so I mean that's pretty cool

245
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,529
and it actually by the way just me think
it also takes a blank so if you're

246
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,570
trying to like take a picture something
the bleeding like oh my god bless it

247
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,910
won't take the picture

248
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,380
it'll stop and tell you take it again
he's a schmuck

249
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,529
so let's get onto why I've been
mentioning uses this is great let's get

250
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,079
onto

251
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,060
how it could be bad I'm sure you've
heard of

252
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,470
the state's very recently that came up
with these interesting laws will talk

253
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,790
about them in detail a second

254
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,130
make it illegal to record an on-duty
police officer

255
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,930
okay so I've been talking official
recognition were mildly switching gears

256
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,930
bear with me

257
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,110
on video surveillance in general is

258
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,089
interesting and explain why

259
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,510
audio surveillance video surveillance or
really do really different beasts

260
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,670
audio surveillance comes around from the
days of the gangsters al capone

261
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,839
AAA don't um what it is is a wiretap
laws the White up was a very simply

262
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,560
K you can't record somebody because they
have an expectation of privacy

263
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,180
so if you want to invade that X
expectation of privacy in a court order

264
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,209
excerpts because what i'm talking to
someone on the phone it's me

265
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,760
its them and that's it okay so to invade
the expectation of privacy you have to

266
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,910
get a court order

267
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,510
let's say I'm talking to somebody out in
the open to install an expectation of

268
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,389
privacy

269
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,300
yes because I can't see anybody for
twenty or thirty feet around me

270
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,360
there out if you're shocked I'm private
yeah first liberators and shut down

271
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,240
likes everything else with ignore that
for a minute

272
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,740
realistically there's an expectation of
privacy that's why you're supposed to

273
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,399
meet a court order to report

274
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,420
audio okay video

275
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,490
is your expectation of privacy in video
right now

276
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,860
were too restrictive and yet they want
these to get in unless you're really

277
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,100
clever conseco

278
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,970
okay but if I'm out on the street

279
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,990
and I put up a video camera holding
above my head that I video everybody

280
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,389
legally

281
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:27,800
absolutely that there's no expectation
of privacy or what in a public street

282
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,079
alright that's it a done deal you strip
off all your clothes and run naked down

283
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,550
the street guess what it's still legal
the video you

284
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,610
it may be funny as hell but the way but
it's still legal

285
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,800
okay so there's no expectation of
privacy no court order needed

286
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,190
that's why by the way a lot of of video
surveillance systems are just that

287
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,220
video surveillance systems I don't
casinos where there's only two Mikes in

288
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,329
hoc Signo

289
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,190
and one would be in the cash room and
one would be in like the manager's

290
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,829
office or something else they can catch
it is Kelly

291
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,980
okay that's pretty common actually not
the manager's office but were only one

292
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,380
or two Mikes

293
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,480
so audio surveillance is a very very
different animal

294
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,579
the trying to make it not so okay

295
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,230
%uh these three states a mother jumping
ahead forgive me

296
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,519
it's really cool stuff %uh these three
states Illinois Massachusetts and

297
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,160
Maryland

298
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,699
have actually reinterpreted their audio
surveillance laws into their video

299
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:18,649
surveillance laws

300
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,170
they say for audio surveillance you're
taking an electronic representation up

301
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,000
data

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,769
audio and you're moving at a long
history you know wire

303
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:30,329
Wireless whatever right make sense over
now

304
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:33,790
electronic transmission of data well
image broken down into bits and bytes it

305
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,560
on tronic transmission update apps they
just added the word image

306
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,649
their audio surveillance what's that
sucks

307
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,480
92 court order to take a friggin video
camera picture a way to add a little

308
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
more

309
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,339
language to it because we don't wanna
make you get a court order to booked on

310
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,329
the street cam if kemper everybody

311
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:53,870
especially if it's girls gone wild

312
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,740
so what they did with the added image
and the words under the police officer

313
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,949
so unless a police officer gives consent
you're not allowed to image them

314
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:05,439
an on-duty police officer not like
taking images them and send it down wire

315
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,900
or wire into a DVD your the

316
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,089
VHS ear did whatever

317
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,659
whatever doesn't matter SD card that's
electronic transmission of data

318
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,299
even if its internal the camera is
transmitting the data from the set data

319
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,230
from the sensor

320
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,919
to the cart: okay this is really scary
people

321
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,030
I'm really not happy about that because
what it means is

322
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,418
you know in the very near future you're
talking about very very serious

323
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:32,799
significant a a basically take away your
right

324
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,879
to take a picture only to model release

325
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,490
for everybody in this room if I took the
video that's stupid

326
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,010
gimme a break okay so there's a lot of
people that are working on this

327
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:49,809
and at this is Burke rages Krag yes I i
politician if I headed up there

328
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,289
upper courageous has a really good
printable PDF you walk along around with

329
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:53,799
you

330
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,220
and this is not only because %uh video
this also because of a talker

331
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,929
it to the photography

332
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:05,880
water

333
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,940
over

334
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,720
worker

335
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,000
so if you're a photographer dial down
the time when I get back to Mike

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,510
so if you're a photographer to take a
picture I love for example London Bridge

337
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,129
a that's cool but if you're a
photographer just an Arab clothing

338
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,380
and take a picture London Bridge you get
arrested

339
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,850
okay and it's actually true story and I
definitely can find this police and lied

340
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,520
to me I will give you a free bottle love

341
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,070
climate a climate Scott make whatever
else called arm

342
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,330
there's a a joke website that actually
did that they sent to get dressed as a

343
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,570
tourist you know and shorts and t-shirts

344
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,649
sandal anyway on and they sent him to
London bridges in the UK

345
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,270
any took pictures 12 bridges over to
bother them the next day same guy

346
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,280
not shorts t-shirt and sandals they put
on like turban and and

347
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,970
address in ropes and stuff what's the
pictures and like three policemen

348
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,220
gang tackle okay

349
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,740
so he was like excuse me this is my
right to do

350
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,919
and the like no it's not your arab

351
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,049
point anyway so

352
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,490
there's a lot of people that do things
but photographers and videographers

353
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,549
wright also mingled together

354
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:22,879
brokerages as the printable PDF Carlos
Miller has the photography is not a

355
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,150
crime

356
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,620
there's a lot %uh issues in the UK and
work seeing a lot of issues here in the

357
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
US

358
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,890
other basically what they're doing is
they're saying that they're making it

359
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,780
illegal to point your camera at anything

360
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,990
national security-related scary what's
national security-related

361
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,780
is the hotel Pennsylvania national
security-related yes it's right across

362
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,870
from Penn Station

363
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,610
so is Penn Station national
security-related guess it's a major

364
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,940
transportation up

365
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
it also happens to be one of the most
amazingly beautiful buildings around its

366
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,630
gorgeous is

367
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,289
if they would ever been inside Penn
Station just taken a picture cuz it's a

368
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:56,590
beautiful

369
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,879
a bit a lot of people have I know I have
it's gorgeous place beautiful buildings

370
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,070
its national security restricted to take
a picture

371
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,189
that another I did I actually asked one
or the other

372
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,799
military guys and educate him in all
sorts of interesting couches and crap

373
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,780
stronger

374
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,070
to them and a they told me its national
security restricted but we don't really

375
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,500
bother most people because we know it's
just tourists taking pictures

376
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,450
what should be a bother and it sure
looked uncomfortable on looked away and

377
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,520
wouldn't answer me

378
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,379
I got the idea so

379
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,669
it's getting to the point we're not
always going to be national security

380
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:33,789
restricted and this this is mildly a
joke this is actually an active

381
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,929
vandalism this is the Seattle skyline

382
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,950
Getty Images a fairly copywriting
analytic picture anymore

383
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,490
II that's a joke it's okay somebody
vandalized the wall because Getty Images

384
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,150
trying to counter it everything but

385
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,580
a budget like it but again in the UK to
do the same thing why can't we take

386
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,960
pictures a policeman

387
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,720
you know for our cameras the new guns

388
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,929
this is a serious issue do we have the
right to take pictures

389
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:03,880
okay how about the and I don't believe I
have it here have the guy that was a

390
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,039
the motorcyclist was driving down the
road and was videoing himself driving

391
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,950
down the road it was

392
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,179
speeding like a lot and for

393
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,780
got pulled over by an unmarked Cup car
with the guy with wearing

394
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,889
you know button-down shirt slacks and a
gun ok details details

395
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,780
who screamed at him for five minutes
threatened to shoot him and everything

396
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,559
else I could how are you become a cop

397
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:28,178
hope that would've been nice to tell me
and they let him go with misdemeanor

398
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,159
and then they realized that it could
keep it up on YouTube ten days later and

399
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,350
also there was a felony

400
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,770
and he could go to jail for sixteen
years and its current case by the way

401
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,179
um these these are dangers thanks and
actually got him

402
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,270
for the same thing audio he recorded
audio without the consent

403
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,820
up the policeman who is reporting
personally I think it's BS

404
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,840
say look this is the only loss okay

405
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,090
um you see one party to party could ever
be reader

406
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,020
bloody hell

407
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:07,020
we can fix that

408
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,259
as a yeah on the fly very

409
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,019
okay so um one party in two-party state
Supreme simple

410
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,799
the idea behind this is a member that
I'm talking to someone on the phone and

411
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,070
we have an expectation of privacy you
know two-party state

412
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,799
both parties have to consent to the
recording okay

413
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,658
in a one-party state I all I alone have
to consent to the recording

414
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:36,059
never mind you I i have a little
disclaimer there in the bottom right

415
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,789
please remember I'm non-lawyer okay
check your own laws before you do this

416
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:40,789
don't take my word for

417
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:44,509
I got this of what I consider a
reputable site but please check so if

418
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,529
for example you live in New Jersey

419
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:50,389
and call a friend in New Jersey like
your ex whose

420
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:55,159
I don't know real pain in the ass and
you're trying to make sure that she

421
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:57,929
understands that you're going to be
there on Thursday to pick up your stuff

422
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:00,379
and you don't want any trouble you
trying to be good about this

423
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,100
and on Thursday you show up and she
calls the cops because you're invading

424
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,090
the house

425
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,209
you here's the recording that's illegal
no its not to one-party state

426
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,929
she didn't have to know okay

427
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:16,139
that's cool that's legit but

428
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:20,509
if for example you lived in Connecticut
that would be bad

429
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:24,090
then you would be going to jail not only
for breaking into the house but you

430
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,240
going to jail for federal wiretapping
charges

431
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,559
the care for people seriously okay

432
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,658
buddy with these are the the points
those talk about one party to party

433
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,100
with videotaping an audio tape in the
activity police officers

434
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,029
they're saying that you it's a two-party
state you have to consent to the

435
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:40,769
videotaping which

436
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:44,499
for sure you take the videotape and the
active duty police officer

437
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:48,789
has to consent as well what what
activity police officers gonna consent

438
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:50,470
the video taping him while he's you know

439
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,090
slamming some going to the sidewalk sure
take a picture

440
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,309
not normally gonna happen

441
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:03,490
so that other justifying that they say
well it's not to party consents

442
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,690
its illegal to do he's out in the open

443
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,340
expectation of privacy is not there
anyway

444
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,070
you can also check this out this is one
of the sites I go to

445
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,470
the NCSL is actually National Conference
of State Legislatures

446
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,749
and if you go in there intellectually
show you is that they're gonna ok

447
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:25,700
um election show you first day they just
took a screenshot you get all

448
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,259
I'll it gives you a much better idea of
your state

449
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,950
at how the laws are this is really a
great resource okay this is straight

450
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,820
from the code

451
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,100
if you click on the %uh the specific
sexual coated like to take a ticket for

452
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,659
yourself

453
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:41,559
once you fall asleep a few times with
backup you might actually be able to

454
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,210
figure it out

455
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,929
these things are impenetrable holy God
but

456
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,379
it is useful to know your own state and
the state your ex lives and

457
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:54,529
just detail think um but be careful
videos mentioned and saw a lot of them

458
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:54,929
now

459
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,669
there the rewriting almost literally
reading a loss to make video

460
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,789
a problem and photography

461
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,460
right along with it okay so this means
your gonna get in trouble

462
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,470
you know I didn't say if

463
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,980
this means you're going to get in
trouble is a problem I mean

464
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,399
like trust me this this person

465
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:20,419
in Houston in Houston photographed

466
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,259
a cop cause parking in a handicap spot
to get coffee

467
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:28,669
come on that crappy you know you're
alright so is only part there for five

468
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:29,799
minutes but still it's crappy

469
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,340
right that's that's rude in this unit
parks a handicap spot come on

470
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,659
so the guy photographs with cellphone
the cop followed him home

471
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:41,809
and threatened to take unit give the
phone or you're going to jail

472
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,859
okay dude here's the phone I mean

473
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:47,879
this is abuse but it happens so

474
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,289
you're going to get in trouble because I
like to think for my hacker friends is

475
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:55,549
good people who go out of their way to
do the right thing yeah

476
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:58,730
okay %uh but I mean

477
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,340
recording police is now legal there's
all sorts of people coming up with ways

478
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,929
to try to fix things

479
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,919
um there's cops watch they actually send
up video cameras that

480
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,799
back in the old days they set up film
video cameras would send it back to them

481
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,679
or VHS rather

482
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,379
he sent it back to them after a while
they put up in the database not that

483
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:17,679
their databases greats

484
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,869
but it does work

485
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:27,539
they're they're a very early and take up
and strange enough for all my ranting

486
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:27,960
about

487
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,059
you know changing the laws maxine X

like to think I was a good cop so

489
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:38,980
if you think I meant a couple not I'm
actually pro place I believe we need

490
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,419
them

491
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,619
but it's a personal thing fair however

492
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:46,349
do you are definitely going to get in
trouble did

493

497
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:07,039
let me be honest that's the goal don't

498
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,230
them

499
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,279

data card

502
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,450
share kazman early they understand
that's where the data is okay

503
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,730
here's the data card

504
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,859
I don't care I'm fine with that you know
why

505
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:33,750
the bearded gonna become a quick no

506
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,909
awesome okay ed I learned this offer
read it

507
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:41,580
um but there was a a record copped a
while back

508
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,899
and what they did was they said how do
you record a cop it if they tell you to

509
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,159
hand over the SD card not get screwed

510
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,960
these two projects that I found out
about once the project was a commercial

511
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,019
product

512
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,200
gonna come which is again become can
become whatever which is the bottom

513
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,740
there is actually a an open source
project

514
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,159
that runs on your smartphone or depends
on your camera might be able to run

515
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:00,899
their

516
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:05,049
actually will once you finish reporting
what you'd stop recording

517
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,109
it then immediately upload it to the

518
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:11,859
place if your choice FTP your server
whatever head over the SD card

519
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:15,049
its cool by the time the best word it's
pretty on your server K

520
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,658
life is good occur at the SD card go to
town

521
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,090
gonna digitally have a nice day because
I got on my 3G phone

522
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,179
and it's gone alright now and

523
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:29,299
this by the way kicker quicker fairly
quick whatever

524
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:33,299
the actually uploaded in real time

525
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,499
okay so your recording it

526
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:41,799
its streaming and its streaming up to
the to the net

527
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:46,019
and it could be streaming life to
somebody watching that cup for lies you

528
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:50,039
right now so get head over the SD card

529
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,830
give it to them it's okay because if
you're set up previously

530
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,549
it prior to this SEM incident and you're
good

531
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:02,509
your cell there's no problems okay so
again that was going to come in quick

532
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:05,789
um aunt it's the other points don't get
arrested

533
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,429
know your rights the rights I kinda
covered with Burke rages and the

534
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:13,909
the other project Carlos Miller dot com
don't get arrested how do we avoid that

535
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:20,909
well you know I can I can informed the
police that I'm recording

536
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,770
PLC their up

537
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:31,139
I'm recording audio and video this is
the visual equivalent of those phone

538
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,570
calls the mic to companies and

539
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,450
before you get to talk to a live person
goes this call will be recorded for

540
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,800
training purposes only

541
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,070
okay that what's that

542
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:45,389
here I'm recording you

543
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm recording a true for training for
but I'm not going there anyway

544
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,610
hey okay

545
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,720
so and so if you can

546
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,520
be informed if your rights you can do
various things to set up

547
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,570
if you're going to a protest march or
whatever I

548
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,720
honestly would we're pretty sure to me
it sounds stupid but I would do it

549
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,400
I would also set your camera for your 3G
phone or whatever you're using to record

550
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,130
video

551
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:15,320
up with one of these the programs going
to come equipped to make sure that your

552
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,110
stuff gets off even if they take your
phone

553
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,990
and smash on the ground it should get
the the image the video up to the

554
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,240
upward server there's a lot of people
fighting this legally

555
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,930
a Jan versus Massachusetts State Police

556
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,100
you can video tape and publicize it this
is not even the person

557
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,520
this case by the way was if the person
who took the video

558
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,810
this was the person who they gave the
video to and that person for on the net

559
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:43,700
and the police said you can't do that I
gotta be legally I'm putting it up on

560
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,450
the net with which a problem unlike will
it shows bad things about the place

561
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,730
and for

562
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,970
you can't do that yes thank you

563
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,380
so if there's a lot of people doing
legal a

564
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,600
ramification legal methods to try to
keep your rights intact

565
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,700
and I strongly recommend looking them up
and and if you're an avid photographer

566
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,370
an avid

567
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,830
a social social not social media but
like a social events

568
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,919
type a protester person whatever I could
really get involved because it will

569
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,040
affect things like you know

570
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,409
your arrest record your job prospects
year

571
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:24,030
you know your friends in jail mom you
know I'm in public trust me

572
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,920
so know your rights

573
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,720
there's there's a lot of I mean this is
just I just went through and did five

574
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,690
seconds worth

575
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,050
it's ridiculous okay so how do I keep my
face at databases

576
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,210
how do I not get stock

577
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,110
buy something by them taking a video and
seeing my face

578
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,700
how do I make sure that I got my rights
done I'm good I'm fine I'm solid I've

579
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,130
got my

580
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,550
by cameras set up for my phone set up
with the right programs but

581
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,470
even if they get me on a video like you
know throwing a stone at it

582
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,620
g20 garter whatever I don't wanna know
how I make sure that they can identify

583
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,310
me

584
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,060
so we're going back to facial
recognition so forgive him something a

585
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,750
little bit around

586
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,570
um don't go to Vegas casino or

587
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,950
well don't come carts go to a casino
most the time they don't record your

588
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,510
face I mean yes you recorded but

589
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,410
its not kept for long I get it that the
second don't get arrested because then

590
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,490
you're going in a database

591
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,490
and I'll get a driver's license because
then you're going to database that's a

592
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:20,900
perhaps

593
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,220
I like driving around it so

594
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,150
go grave

595
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:35,370
drafted by bike to Boston tomorrow no so

596
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,000
what he actually do I mean is this a
real threat

597
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,910
it is a real problem are they going to
identify you are they gonna enough to

598
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,000
your camera they gonna

599
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,290
smasher SD card what's going to happen
at the range of threats their proposed

600
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,870
yes they're gonna smash your SD card or
they're gonna confiscated

601
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,870
so I I gave you a couple will try to
decide to get rid of that data

602
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,670
immediately

603
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,430
okay they gonna smash it maybe maybe not
are they gonna take a picture your face

604
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,150
and try to identify you later

605
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,490
yes but for now it's not a big deal

606
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,720
realistically most cameras don't track
faces facial recognition

607
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,940
in the industrial world okay which is
you know commercial and industrial

608
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,320
is still very expensive it still very
hard to set up

609
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,350
it's still very hard do correctly and
has the

610
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,730
success rate of the toddler with the
Lego Mindstorms

611
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,750
okay its socks

612
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,810
had a really good system really well ten
system facial recognition

613
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,419
is about 60 percent I mean that's good
system okay so

614
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,320
don't worry about it too much it most
cameras aren't even looked at to be

615
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,840
honest with you

616
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,030
look at I set up cameras & Manhattan I
set up cameras rely PDF September survey

617
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,820
casinos

618
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,820
mostly get this much attention they
don't look good

619
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,320
no one touched don't worry about most
the time that doesn't do anything stupid

620
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,129
please

621
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,400
but most recordings

622
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,810
deleted after three days 14 days 30 days
as a kind a common

623
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm sort of benchmarks and the

624
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,960
the reason the storage videos very
expensive the store I mean I've

625
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,070
installed a 140 terabyte

626
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,750
a San arrays 4 a little tiny Indian
casino

627
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,399
that's not cheap there was a major
portions are operating budget for that

628
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,540
here was to buy that array

629
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,639
okay and that really helps 30 days with
the video

630
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,639
that's it so you know after a month that
they haven't caught your probably good

631
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,918
but some art military hold seven years

632
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,259
and they talk about making a twenty
that's a full perimeter coverage all

633
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,830
military bases

634
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,399
that's a lot of storage they have
chessie's I've been the one

635
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,529
that the chassis the store chess is for
the discs reach to the for concealing

636
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,080
and it was a taller building the here
and now Toolroom

637
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,799
and it was a big freakin row problem is
they have a huge alarm on offense and

638
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,890
therefore promoter coverage by war

639
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,670
and held it for seven years holy crap
okay

640
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,160
they were getting rid of recordings they
were just decommissioning your chances

641
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,009
and thought about putting a new one

642
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,630
that's all they work so look here's the
simple sport

643
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,280
if your gonna do anything really stupid

644
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,170
okay um like I don't know had a street
sign

645
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,320

damnit I didn't realize it would show up
I'm sorry %ah ordered on the right

648
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,770
recession turns IT workers the hackers

676
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,920
we let him out after trial and like
normally it's one guy exporting about

677
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,569
we had 45 officers escorting him out

678
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:32,349
just so we could laugh it up I would

679
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:37,200
I love that day netminder he was in jail
in three months cuz it was stupid

680
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,410
but that day was great

681
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,720
anyway so don't do permanent marker on
your face go to disguise my face

682
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,180
a ticket offer we can all come and see
if the guy with black all over your face

683
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,129
come over gonna jump

684
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,609
don't do this as much as everybody goes
hey put a

685
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:55,759
put up in tears over your head and
walked down the street you know first of

686
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:59,230
you can see them through the second of
its control top fro

687
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:06,230
so the all-comers

688
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,980
were actually they were film and and if
yes the older cameras are you talking

689
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,450
with the old

690
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,039
still %uh sorry your IP video cover the
old analog video cameras that have

691
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,019
crappy resolution

692
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:24,019
I find it fascinating that you know how
much cameras pick up your pantyhose

693
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:33,759
for Mennonites okay we really don't
wanna hear

694
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,349
%uh not i apologize. he's right

695
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:44,640
depending on the IR the IR cut filter in
the camera what the technical details

696
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,308
depends on how much you can penetrate
your materials

697
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:50,599
and that's why if you have all the old
us where I think it's the Sony

698
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,900
with super night vision there of the
market now because the director close

699
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,829
X really interesting they call them
extra cameras there's a reason

700
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:03,099
their popular on some various internet
sites not that I know any of them

701
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:06,750
up but unless your mask is something
like this guy's

702
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,569
you know you're not gonna get away with
that okay

703
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:15,099
masks don't work very well so what does
work

704
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:22,099
very I would be very clear

705
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,800
we work in for a sec if you're wearing a
mask

706
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,800
you're committing the wrong crime okay

707
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,380
sell for what do you do I'm gonna give
me some simple stupid stuff

708
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,880
by a phone that you don't normally use
intense

709
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,320
okay boost mobile pay cash walk into a
freakin store like whole mall

710
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,690
give my 100 bucks you look over the
phone with a full month unlimited usage

711
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,710

712

schmuck

713
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,260
okay

714
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,359
and so that you can send text messages
and phone people and its

715
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,840
untraceable to burn phone it goes by by
when you're done okay

716
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,920
change your clothing disguise your body

717
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,650
don't worry too much about your face
what you doing something exceptionally

718
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,190
stupid

719
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,590
but change how you walk put lives in
your shoes I'm not saying wear high

720
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,250
heels

721
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,700
okay I'm not Chris Paget but what i'm
saying is

722
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,410
if you walk like this what like this

723
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,500
scope inch good exercise okay

724
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,070
and also changes your height change how
you look change so you walk

725
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:31,410
I'm actually standing on my the balls my
feet right now okay

726
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,700
yes that's lost image hey there you go
okay

727
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:41,700
so there's various different things um

728
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,200
and if any of them in the audience I
don't think it'll

729
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,170
any review so thanks for and by the way
in the lower right corner that's not an

730
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,099
InfoSec person quite the opposite is
anybody that is lower right corner

731
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,079
very good

732
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,450
that's scare

733
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,309
take a look slight difference

734
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:15,329
makeup can do miracles

735
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:18,750

system you're gonna go up against some

738
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,490
other measures knows too far ahead ratio
some the measured knows to cheekbone

739
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,170
ratio

740
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,510
different ratios a polygon its okay so
we've changed our clothes we changed our

741
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,230
walk

742
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,329
how do we change your face if we're
gonna do something exceptionally stupid

743
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:42,849

748
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,190
okay Krazy Glue what we're talking about
crazy glue

749
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,200
if you have hair this might work if you

750
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,069
follicle challenge that might not take
your ears

751

them back and if you're

752
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm chronologically challenged

753
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,819
year old for him back and pulled back
yourself

754
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:28,808
facelift seriously I'm joking it
actually works okay

755
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:33,290
um makeup works really well I don't know
squat about makeup but I know

756
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:40,290
this is pretty impressive um

757
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:44,589
its impressive and scary all the same
breath

758
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:51,058
up her eyes are closed and I have to say
that because it took me three looks and

759
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:51,520
went home

760
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,740
so yeah her eyes are closed a makeup can
change

761
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,260
the contours of your face you can
highlight things you can

762
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,740
downgrade things I don't know the
technical terms I'm cut big on makeup is

763
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,510
you can tell um but you get the idea
okay

764
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,549
even a smaller fashions these are

765
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:13,690
before and after picture over some
person whose name I forgot she is a

766
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,650
famous movie star

767
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:18,530
but that's her on the left and the right
so it changed whose what she looks like

768
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,490
and how she looks

769
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,099
into much more ways but enough that it
can for the human okay

770
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:27,480
a so sorry there

771
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,910
you can grow beards but it takes time to
grow

772
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,868
you're talking about actually kinda a
different strategy and that's don't

773
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:36,589
change yourself for the crime

774
00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:39,890
change urself for every other that his
life

775
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,609
in other words what you can do is grow a
beard

776
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:47,200
and then before the crime like at the
time of the crime

777
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,670
shave it off okay l-shaped that's a bit
of two looks like a totally different

778
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,170
beard

779
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,069
and afterwards growth back %um you have
to make sure this week between crime and

780
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:58,049
and going back to work but you get the
idea

781
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:01,640
so change something about yourself in
everyday life put lives in your shoes

782
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,250
for everyday life and then when you
commit the crime take

783
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,480
looks out to every day your coworker see
like this little EC like that an attack

784
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,030
like this

785
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,700
or you know pin your ears back for three
months before crime before you go back

786
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,380
passed all those cameras and the day the
crime year old if a person and the day

787
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,170
after

788
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,290
that's a whole different strategy but
that's a good point

789
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,329
okay so anyway there's lots of ways to
keep your face

790
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:31,000
out-of-date a basis there's lots of ways
to keep your face changed if it ever

791
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,130
goes into the database

792
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,020
there's lots of ways to make sure you
don't go into a database those rules

793
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,369
those losses rights we talked about all
this

794
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:41,290
so you know will you gotta change
something

795
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,359
to make sure you're good you gotta watch
your rights you gotta

796
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:48,910
protect your rights you've got a
basically make sure that you've got a

797
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:49,759
problem

798
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,150
with what's going on so that you can
protect the rights to your house

799
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,210
don't lose which you've got that was
what's going on okay

800
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:00,119
you know if I can put a video camera on
my house and did you take my front yard

801
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,329
for security there's a problem but in
the near future if they keep going the

802
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:03,920
way they are

803
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,000
you not to be able to do it thank you

804
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,220
about okay so

805
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,760
um my timing is awesome so %uh two
things

806
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,760
um for some ass for questions three
things for things like it was a goal on

807
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,750
nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition

808
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,180
um someone ask her some questions I wat

809
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,279
I'm also going to be as I said looking
at here in about 10 minutes to get done

810
00:45:26,279 --> 00:45:29,220
a rheostat where I encourage you to call
in IRC and

811
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,079
chattin crash that not a question both
but %uh

812
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:36,790
basically asked questions come along
please and the

813
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,700
fell think everything ok and the slides
gonna be up on my website at the station

814
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,970
don't go there now it's just a
placeholder site right now but it there

815
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,549
to the all the slides the up

816
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:48,319
as well as lower right up to have the
talk assailed because most my slides are

817
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,130
just pictures

818
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:54,440
you understand the slide to the right up
%uh questions

819
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,079
is the at microphone I believe this what
they wanted it

820
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,040
just thinking back on the again the camp
I agree with you that I'm

821
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,109
it's it's always preferable to seek
technological

822
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:10,980
solutions to avoid confrontations the
running works really well too

823
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:16,290
yeah I I'm it seems you're actually
counseling as to give into bullying and

824
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,470
intimidation

825
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,140
when resting up our fourth amendment
rights said yes and no

826
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:24,540
let me ask you a question had if I am a
comp

827
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,640
and I say give me your SD card at the
camera right now and you do so

828
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,848
okay are you giving in the fourth minute
rights giving up for the rights

829
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:32,660
absolutely

830
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,808
you're also gift giving up the right to
have your ass beat

831
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,190
okay iraq not MSP anyway

832
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:43,020
only together irony to get that out and
other data trust me there there's

833
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,750
interpretations that respectively the
point is that a few days later with you

834
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,540
that video goes up on youtube

835
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,790
are you really giving up your rights
you're basically going try

836
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,910
come up come in take it it's good I
don't care

837
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,910
not I understand what you're saying I
understand we'd rather

838
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,328
you're right you're absolutely correct
but I'd rather say

839
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:05,779
give up your SD card but still have the
video and don't get hurt

840
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:09,250
because as much as I like good cops and
I said it before pro police approve the

841
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,059
police

842
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:13,589
there's a lot of hassles out there I'm
not gonna lie right-wing nationalist

843
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:14,470
barreling at you

844
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,980
you make fashion decisions but yes I
think we are

845
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,069
we have to be certain spectrum we have
two seek

846
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:26,819
opportunities to assert ourselves and
push back to it what an asshole compass

847
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,000
coming at you with a baton

848
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,510
not the time to research is off excuse
me know what happens as you know what

849
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,309
happens

850
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:35,480
usually but be prepared that that's it
that's the worst case scenario your

851
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,430
preps were

852
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,339
awesome that simple if it doesn't happen

853
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:43,910
ok a little extra prep time there thanks
that's all I mean

854
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:48,970
I respect to say please understand are
any other questions yes here

855
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,529
middle sorry it's hot here the
headlights moment that offer give me two

856
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:55,670
questions one of our nation Manchin won
his paranoia

857
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,790
other information mansion party is some
good on both

858
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,420
the the current state from what you
describe is that

859
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,049
different systems analyze spatial
patterns in different ways such credit

860
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,500
have different algorithms they have
different system internet or APIs

861
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,650
pressure at what point do you think the
state of the art can be sophisticated

862
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,410
enough so that they have a standard
protocol

863
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:20,129
for official recognition which could
then potentially result

864
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,849
in what's essentially hash function have
an individual face so instead of

865
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:24,790
searching

866
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,900
direct images when all was associated
storage just hash

867
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,420
right get this to text search strings
absolutely good question I don't think

868
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,740
it's gonna happen for a while

869
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,410
the reason this video surveillance and
their I'm gonna move along faster fotis

870
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,089
video surveillance is to assist still a
very secretive sorta field they're very

871
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:41,710
very competitive and they don't

872
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,049
Celtic each other even so it's really
really tough for them to

873
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:47,490
come up with it with the standard take
like a lot of them say they're open

874
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,369
standards it's bullshit means the cables
plugged into each other they don't work

875
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,079
with each other

876
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:54,839
on a date level okay could use to like a
standard or something like that

877
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:59,990
and mandate that for certain federal
systems %uh it could but he

878
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,359
he made it a federal systems casinos are
still our biggest customers

879
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,779
so it doesn't matter and if they buy
that this system because that's the

880
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:07,690
better system

881
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,260
than that's what they're gonna use and
not the hash their stuff for the federal

882
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,010
stuff

883
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,160
it's a really involved that's a business
question that really technical question

884
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,819
technically it's very simple to do

885
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,650
a business question 3 difficult doesn't
make sense yeah not sequester

886
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,690
arm over the past several years

887
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,569
the federal authorities have been
providing France monies to local

888
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:29,599
arm governs its cover for video systems

889
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,480
%uh do you know anything about back and
interconnects so that they can get in

890
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,770
there and suck the data out

891
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,250
most the time no again different systems
because they they provide the money but

892
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,980
the fifth the state or local

893
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,089
authority buys the system from the low
is better that that

894
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:45,980
you know give them the best kickbacks
not I said that om

895
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,270
but it knows the time there's no
interconnects there okay I mean look

896
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,440
what I used to do in CA and says he
searches

897
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,200
a seven assists and I had to tell them
what you please install a pop-up blocker

898
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,799
I'm gonna fucking die from closing

899
00:49:55,799 --> 00:49:59,500
for four thousand boxes that they're not
the smartest people in the world

900
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,420
so agreed yes I apart as we cover this I
got here late

901
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,819
we had official recognition camera
somebody brought in for shingles at work

902
00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:11,410
on and we figured out to it would to it
would he was supposed to be recognized

903
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,368
and gender and also motion and we
figured we could game it on

904
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:17,470
if we just took those like random round
stickers that you get in office and

905
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:21,140
great because it it pops up pops up the
cheeks are getting sick of subjects

906
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,710
yes great talk happening here which I
have to meet the guy called CV dazzle

907
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,750
actually as a system where you pink
things on your face and it totally

908
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,810
screws up the system

909
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:32,140
yeah and that's why the next had his
stuff in my slides and it took it out

910
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,480
because they want to be rude

911
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,579
I strongly recommend a good is talking
I'm actually gonna be a stalker I really

912
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:38,410
want to see if we have to talk to you
thinking like

913
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,569
out about you think they like it
stickers are some elitist mixtures using

914
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:42,829
plenty of Wales

915
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:45,359
there's plenty of ways to game systems
but again it depends if you know what

916
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,848
system you're going against if it snows
too far ahead

917
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:51,200
this doesn't matter right

918
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,390
profession I'm I again so-and-so's less

919
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,790
if I don't the for this a is it I'll
possibly know if anything like a

920
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,650
LED's re: LED pursuing leads to being a
ladies are very low a

921
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:05,650
or abuse you can plan some points that
I'm

922
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,390
I know if you can t complain the can
with I was thinking like you know there

923
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,750
are

924
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,930
their LED hats in shields the crappy you
can point the camera from seeing your

925
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:13,770
face

926
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,160
but from not recognizing our changing
your face is a whole different story

927
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,848
comment but the their car LED I have
another talking to a lot to talk about

928
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:21,619
this stuff

929
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:25,180
and I try to do new material for talk um
there there's nobody had the guy

930
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,859
designed and I'm sure you know

931
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:30,420
you take the pic has learned downsize it
a bit it'll be roughly similar idea

932
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,770
and it's so strong IR LED is that the
cameras blinded

933
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,060
so similar idea but you can't really
change your face with them I don't think

934
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,859
or its pretty calm enough to try to
think I was just I was not stopping

935
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:41,359
everything up to go seeking

936
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,040
I know a lot about high-tech chemicals
used by our filters their color filters

937
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,299
I was thinking is there any other are
wavelength that

938
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:51,359
particularly if you're say you're going
to go someplace to go mad late on your

939
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,799
head maybe but that's about it

940
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:56,880
okay as I R these visuals very much all
they have no

941
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,220
police brutality in a situation where
you have something illegal

942
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,509
on camera what do you do you hopefully
have set it up so that you're uploading

943
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:04,450
before that

944
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,450
like us over the Gandhi comp on the cam
or quick

945
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:12,259
on if you don't %uh you love people
carry a spare SD card slot the SD card

946
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,099
for the cops come over

947
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:17,619
you have it they don't know you have it
out as far as uploading it

948
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:20,670
and now there's a guy named Alex months
ago a great talk yesterday his lawyer

949
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,790
Tiffany read as a lawyer %uh hell broke
loose in my presentations Lori flushes

950
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,569
in practice

951
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:32,270
we have a lot of the geek lawyers use
them

952
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,480
stocks sorry I I know that so

953
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,589
that question on the crushing the memory
cards from the police come by

954
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,930
a so love the approach doesn't TT 0

955
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,529
sup this movement they at carry cameras
with them

956
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:50,579
to prove it easyer police brutality
right if the cops just take a person who

957
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,400
jail for doing that the problem

958
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,390
and then you suggest you like to yessir
3G connection

959
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,779
Welden an emergency you can shut down
the cell phone number correct

960
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:02,859
right at your local store that you've
got to sell I carry two cell phone so

961
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:04,369
you want my cell phone here

962
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:07,430
doesn't have to be the one with the
pictures on it okay yeah

963
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,349
my question is basically had as these
new laws or impact that causes very

964
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:12,640
critical for

965
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,058
if you're protesting you know they make
it be that because

966
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:19,700
for political reasons you know look did
I i'm not going to comment on political

967
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,569
things

968
00:53:20,569 --> 00:53:23,680
in terms if you know that the politics
of them you're gonna know what you're

969
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,390
going out there for your going up there
for protest I would strongly recommend

970
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,359
you decide if it's worth you're asking
to be

971
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,170
because that simple oh man if it is the
turn off 3G which is kind of unusual

972
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,049
even after Katrina after three weeks we
have 3G back

973
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:39,130
om but you get the idea speaker

974
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,730
yes hi first one it's a statement than a
question statement is

975
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:47,190
you're talking about you're not allowed
to photograph certain buildings

976
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,559
and what not yeah I i wasnt East Berlin

977
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,020
1981 and I remember dullard I wasn't
east berlin in nineteen oh I'm sorry

978
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,940
it's okay those actually quite critical

979
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,609
but that was the big warning they said
don't take pictures the

980
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:07,270
so sensitive buildings are government
sites because his

981
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:11,670
is completely legal and I thought how
ludicrous is that this government policy

982
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,559
but no apparent best welcome to America
said

983
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,490
but %uh the question is not tens is

984
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:23,650
millions of people I would imagine use a
Apple's iPhoto which has facial

985
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:26,240
recognition built into it now

986
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,040
I and their entire photo libraries are
cross-reference

987
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:35,029
on their own computer right is there
possibility maybe they goulet be doing

988
00:54:35,029 --> 00:54:35,980
this in the future

989
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,109
across surfacing every one of us ability

990
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,259
if dude are you a geek to

991
00:54:43,259 --> 00:54:46,609
yet because already does I would trust
me it's it's being done

992
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:49,348
look you can live your life publicly
live let private you can live and let

993
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:50,740
live your life semi-private

994
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,990
you make the choice you put your stuff
from Picasa your stuff on Flickr you put

995
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,950
your stuff

996
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:58,130
you get the idea its public next so

997
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:02,020
you know or you keep it on hold on your
computer will you know next year for

998
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:05,190
and um live your life public-private

999
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,869
your choice if you live in public you
will be tagged he will be in databases

1000
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:12,059
from that simple good

1001
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:16,190
one minute less question or less to
questions right gotta go up

1002
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,250
balancing the rights you know a privacy

1003
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,200
you've claimed you know videoing

1004
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,299
what is around me you

1005
00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:30,829
whatever I go outside RK you know you
take picture very think it's what you do

1006
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:31,380
with it

1007
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,890
they get you in trouble right now I'm
not talking about 30 in cops okay taxes

1008
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,240
server

1009
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,299
separation RK questions are about

1010
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:43,430
on balancing the right to privacy

1011
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,020
against the Ravens for me to document

1012
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:52,500
what you're doing around me for my
personal benefits so somebody assaults

1013
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,680
me

1014
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,569
I have more on video so question is

1015
00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:02,069
to balance the rate love me

1016
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:06,000
to take a video what's around me against

1017
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,940
your personal right thoughts

1018
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,900
your rights or the government says
they're or what you make the government

1019
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,119
say they are

1020
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,450
make the government say what you wanna
say vote

1021
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,940
change the law if you don't like it I'm
being honest

1022
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:26,470
cameras are paid to have to work sorry
cameras are up I do hats work

1023
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,690
for sometimes it depends on had defends
the camera

1024
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,819
thank you them
