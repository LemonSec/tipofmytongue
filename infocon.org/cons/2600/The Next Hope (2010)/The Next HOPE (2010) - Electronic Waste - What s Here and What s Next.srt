1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,730
I'm seven-hour common and I'm gonna be
talking about electronic waste tonight

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,599
I'm so you're a ticket super depressed
so

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,509
survey kinda laying out we're gonna do
I'm why am I here

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,250
why should we care about you age why
should any of us

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,259
and what's the life cycle Avila
electronic waste what's the

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,470
the regulatory environment and where in
the brain power

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,929
and finally what industries are in a
similar position could be facing similar

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:30,599
issues

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,309
so I first of many sexually

10
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm I work at the University
Pennsylvania as Isis

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,820
streeter and also sending me to schools
to get a master

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,559
I'm studies graduate and or also it can

13
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,210
I do some work with their harapan green
tea group

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,260
whenever I'm also on the board as to 576
which is her space in philadelphia

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,610
I we've a little bit of activity down on
her Christmas village so come visit us

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,899
I'm really into plants do some

17
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,199
dabbling in like heaven for me learning
stuff and I'm

18
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,530
really love bikes if you want I'm
regulations apt I'm

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,570
soon the reason i'm talking about. track
racing is

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,130
am I found uninteresting computers

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,759
and tree-hugging guilty and kind of let
me to you thinking about electronic

22
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,320
waste

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,710
as a sysadmin have to throw a service
fairly regularly so this is something

24
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,049
that

25
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,360
that was really bothering me on and in
general and the

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,320
about environmental stuff attended
attended crafty toward regulatory policy

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,030
and environmental justice in particular
so

28
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,040
but full disclosure these are some of
the things that I can not talk about

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,790
I'm intelligently reasonably I'm just
not a chemist so I can talk to you about

30
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,479
like this

31
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,610
molecular structure different toxins I'm

32
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,930
I'm not a materials engineer so i cant
talk a whole lot about

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm good good substitute materials

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,310
I'm not any have an engineer so am not
very good at

35
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,560
imagining better chemical processes are
chemical processes

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,719
and I'm not an economist think so not an
economist

37
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,330
so I'm figuring out new models and doing
business is

38
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,470
kinda me on beyond my skill set but I'll
do my best

39
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,370
exam affluent something to

40
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,800
what is erased and why should we care
about it we're going to talk a little

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,129
bit about how much is there

42
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,129
on how much how much more regaining I
would it's me dove

43
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,310
I'm why it's difficult to pull apart and
I some other difficulties

44
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,400
so electronic waste my gas are

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,209
I'm more obviously things like I C Ortiz
all computers on cell phones he see our

46
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:36,950
skis

47
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,810
but some some unexpected stuff and
children's

48
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,800
talking toys old like Hallmark Cards
weird sound bites from you

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,959
mike capps pieces from your car computer
there are unexpected sources at the

50
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,590
waist

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,480
steer growing and

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,560
we do you make a lot of waste I'm so

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,640
in here it's the heard from you see with
the lights but how many people in here

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,440
manage

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,200
hardware like routers switches servers
to libraries

56
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,550
yes few people on I do too and

57
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,530
eyes to I can you a shout out like about
how long do you keep your equipment

58
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,590
around three years five years ten years

59
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,580
for years anybody else its thats

60
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,750
reason about yet share about 325

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,330
and ants so that's going to create a lot
of waste

62
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,069
and organizational level I don't know
about you but my business and IT

63
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:30,170
graveyard

64
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,470
never even met a lot of stuffs a lot so
each of us are creating a lot of

65
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,670
electronic places we go

66
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,269
as you go along I'm but Missouri sec
funnies is pretty

67
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,290
difficult it's trash so we don't we
don't value enough to track and measure

68
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:43,720
it

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,340
and it goes to you certs all sorted
interesting channels and

70
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,049
should be really hard to measure so one
of the better ways to estimate is to

71
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,060
take sales data

72
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,489
and multiply that by the estimated life
span you can kinda get an idea of how

73
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,349
much for treating

74
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,610
and there's a feared complication

75
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,049
I'm with technical complications meet
when you start talking about

76
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,519
municipal versus on municipal waste so

77
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,909
in the US electronic waste only makes up
2 percent municipal waste

78
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:14,170
that's the stuff because inner city
dumps but there's I'm

79
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,780
municipal waste only takes up a small
portion of our we stream so

80
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,600
electronic waste is more than our
landfills but the stuff that we as

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,770
individuals that we as homeowners and
whatever

82
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,750
I throw away into into our landfills
into municipal system

83
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,570
is what UPA is mostly concerned with
because that's what they manage

84
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,080
am okay so israel's day it was like I we
can measure it but seriously how much do

85
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,840
we actually make

86
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,889
am the what is that sand something
Electronics Association

87
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,290
and fix that per household in the US we
have about twenty four devices

88
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,330
we think we get rid of about five to
seven million pieces and

89
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,159
tons of junk every year and in the EU

90
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,970
I we think that we on we think that
people are gaining about

91
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,350
ten-point three million tonnes a few
devices every year

92
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,830
at one point the US government found out
that they were throwing away something

93
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,120
like ten thousand computers a week

94
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,180
and that was excluded military post
offices so there's a lot of this stuff

95
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,419
in the US about eighty-two percent
forget seinfeld and about

96
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,370
I 18 percent if it gets recycled and
putting that in quotes

97
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,150
because as we'll find out later a lot of
stuff to get Center cyclers actually in

98
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,250
second exported

99
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,970
which in most cases in the US is
perfectly legal

100
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,560
so I'm Moore's Law also applies to waste

101
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,979
such SEP speech go up but also its

102
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,289
for just gaining more waste and and on a
tree

103
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:43,250
nasty curve and me waste is the
fastest-growing component of both US

104
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,259
municipal waste

105
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,759
anti-eu manufacturing waste and over

106
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,320
between 1990 and 2007 the anonymous

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,139
outweighs that we collected doubled and

108
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,690
if the EU has recognized this and I
decided to move away from a

109
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,590
per wheat per person collection goal

110
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,949
more to a portion devices that have made
it to the market call

111
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,650
onto train tracks these for trends

112
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,660
am so another reason we should care
about it is on

113
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,280
it's there's a lot of valuable stuff in
here I'm if you care about conflict

114
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,569
diamonds you should be thinking about
conflicts call 10 for example it's it's

115
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:22,660
a rare substance

116
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,690
and Sam its article on a complex in
Congo

117
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,759
if you care about people will you should
be thinking about peaked at on the stuff

118
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,780
that's in capacitors

119
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,610
it's pretty rare to if you are concerned
with

120
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,740
I'm not tough removal for call you're
gonna love call

121
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,500
gold-mining me these little electronics

122
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,949
so for example in gold mining I'm

123
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:48,930
for an 18 carat ring and you have to go
through 20

124
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,400
twenty times mine waste to to get that
little bit of cold

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,900
and which is horrific accept that

126
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,110
if you take a time fam circuit boards
you accident actually 17 times

127
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,190
richer gold than or on and with those
statistics still

128
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,110
only three percent of the world's called
comes from scrap

129
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,819
here's a picture of a gold mine you to
see how it's

130
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:18,229
its its me an incredible scarred the
landscape in Western Australia

131
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,870
heat-seeking a city in

132
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,270
I'm there's other valuable stuff there's
also is recyclable metals copper gold

133
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,530
platinum nickel city

134
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,180
me stuff in there and as we can pull it
out begin result music

135
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,610
and computers half and and Steve waste
has lots a reasonable start classes very

136
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,419
recyclable

137
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,380
I'm same affairs met only minimal these
other metals plastics are sort of a

138
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,919
different story

139
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,780
but they can be recycled so we literally

140
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,340
sitting on and on an electronic waste
mine

141
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,090
which is awesome right so then why is
tracking the stuff so difficult why is

142
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,629
it so hard to measure

143
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,129
why is getting the good stuff out if
it's a difficult wiry sending so much

144
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,960
but other places that were we don't
necessarily want to end up

145
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,970
and the answer is because is really
difficult to get to you so

146
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,970
think in the last 10 PCs he took part
I'm much they're all the same brand they

147
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,080
probably had different ways

148
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,590
like getting physically getting used to
them so there's not

149
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,690
a standardized way %uh either aunt
separating

150
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,919
I should we see get to the cuts a bit
nor is there

151
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,240
a standard way of marking how to you
like putting standardized markings on

152
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,500
how to open the stuff

153
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,409
so if there was an if there was like a
standard settles logo's

154
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,588
to you clue and assemblers to which
screw comes out next to the

155
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,940
back to think that we dont that may help
a lot so

156
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,640
so you got you thinking you've taken the
case apart sticky 20 minutes you

157
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,910
frustrated and then

158
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,290
people there people that text for out
and

159
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,819
now so it's got like little things on it
great and so now I have to decided this

160
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,970
where you gonna do that

161
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,930
these stick it in the toaster oven
Pariente decided that someone to get

162
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,830
past that

163
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,130
then you want maybe when I get to the
goal traces on your support

164
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,860
how do you do that well one way to do it
is dissolved in

165
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,890
Acharya which for the chemists rather
the alchemists in the room

166
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,490
you might recognize that as I a nice
little competition from the church

167
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,490
and hydrochloric acid and then actually
at that

168
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,670
out can you precipitate a cold out with
something like fair sulfide

169
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,569
or some other chemical so that might be
too much trouble for you you're not

170
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,800
gonna use in your kitchen

171
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,950
your your your house me to tell you so
when you start with the copper in the

172
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,769
cables

173
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:34,170
well use really gonna sit there with the
box a cat-5 extract every key willing to

174
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,689
pick up around a bit

175
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,120
that protects him to cities a lot of
time and energy to get this out

176
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm but it turns out that labor and
other parts of the world

177
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,449
it's cheap good facilities are expensive
as scrap prices are weird

178
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,470
and reinterpret this weird situation I'm
in which

179
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,850
separations largely a manual process

180
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,769
on another barrier to getting to the
good stuff is that there's a lot of

181
00:09:58,769 --> 00:09:59,570
nasty stuff

182
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,680
there on computers can be 6.3 percent
lead I've heard accurate estimates that

183
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,700
a CRT has like 40 pounds of lead and

184
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,260
the values anybody has your house like I
do you might know that lead is

185
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,500
pretty bad nor a toxin you just don't
wanna around for two years the children

186
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,260
but it could be harmful to dogs to you
I'm flame retardants are just ridiculous

187
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,980
measures assignor talks in

188
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,680
say have to get past all that stuff to
get some good stuff

189
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,690
on so we find ourselves in in on

190
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,990
my cast process system

191
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,290
that's just kind of stupid and expensive
and stupid expensive

192
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,089
I'm me to snatch me the city

193
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,829
but one other things that i think is
just kinda silly is the planned

194
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,990
obsolescence model

195
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm is it adore I consider a server
adorable good so is three years really

196
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,329
horrible

197
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,670
to my mind it's not on we don't have a
whole lot enzyme

198
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,849
a consciousness about on producers
taking back their trash minute to minute

199
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,850
taking on responsibility for the
disposal

200
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,990
we don't have a whole lot of thinking
about designing for the environment

201
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,519
designing settings can be disassembled
so that they can

202
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,610
so that you can pull the valuable stuff
out of

203
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,709
carcinogenic stuff without on find
yourself get it when you send twenty

204
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:15,800
years later

205
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,899
so arm so we've all seen like swappable
parts like %uh talkable

206
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,660
power supplies and the whole thing so is
there

207
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm interested in the reasons beyond the
economic reasons

208
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,170
why every party fiction I i'm Jack a
server can't be

209
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,640
a sophomore as a PCI card understand
their design

210
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,970
upgrades necessary thing but I just our
department just wanna call started my

211
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,630
period is gonna

212
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,260
classes twenty-five years and we can
talk and write ever so

213
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,640
is up back plan on a plate Center really
so special that I

214
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,939
and I need to stop at every 3-5 years

215
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,760
am another reason that we ought to be
concerned about

216
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,010
the way that we skipped exported to to
other nations

217
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:04,639
is am once had once your hard drive is
out of your control

218
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,310
you don't know what's what's happening
to it I recyclers claimed that they and

219
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,649
the destruction

220
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,930
but you know their methods aren't
figures enough ordered

221
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,260
just not doing am and you end up with
situations where

222
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,800
in this photo it's a little hard to see
but there's an ass attack from the

223
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,870
School District of Philadelphia I'm back
him up in a in a frontline special

224
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,000
and in a movie called digital Tom that
the

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,440
Basel Action Network put out I we sell
I'm

226
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,940
a Swiss friend sex expert take apart I'm
hard drive from some transition in DC

227
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,589
and pull off like child where

228
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,200
welfare data I'm information about kids
who had been removed from homes

229
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,300
and other ones be confidential stuff
government contracts defense contracts

230
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,970
stuff is regularly use for scams
anything

231
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,380
I'm as we've talked about a little bit
we know the disassembly stuff dangerous

232
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,450
and so it ends

233
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,209
and tends to flow relievers chief
regulations

234
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,990
are not so good I'm fees these places

235
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,709
I'm places with those situations tend to
be the places where

236
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:11,920
there's a lot of poverty %um worker
protection maybe isn't a top priority

237
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,660
and those are the conditions under which
you get massive

238
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,719
criminal justice I'm if you and look on
youtube for good magazine they have a

239
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,820
really cute little

240
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,700
1 minute 30 seconds video that I'm Alex
the whole thing

241
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,459
and every chance I sway I'm but

242
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,329
we find ourselves in this economic
situation where it's expensive to

243
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:33,310
process it

244
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,500
here and it's cheap to to you think that
is being recycled and send it somewhere

245
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,199
else

246
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,670
and and it it gives us some pretty bad
results

247
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,010
in the places where people are doing
informal disassembly

248
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,600
there's river and not by you China which
is considered to be the capitalist US

249
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,889
disassembly

250
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,100
am there's their waterways that have had
so much Ackley

251
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,760
ac worry she attempted to them that
their PA treating is nearly zero

252
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,149
and this is ever and in 1986 was the
first year the car you started accepting

253
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:13,500
you waste imports prior to that it was
fine when it was

254
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,260
graceland average grant and within one
year

255
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,000
their water supply was dusty inject
water anymore

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,430
their soil there their previously formed
soil

257
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,560
is considered hazardous waste PFI any
number

258
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,860
as national on standards

259
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,149
I it's got all sorts of crazy stuff in a
crime %um cadmium archery

260
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,850
you can eat the stuff that comes on at
the sale anymore

261
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,029
and it also turns out that

262
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:47,279
yeah so another thing that happens when
you send donations in kind of dumb them

263
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,220
into place

264
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,570
is that that place is now inundated with
this product

265
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,519
that otherwise be may or may not have
developed economic

266
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,079
situation this this in the heavens with
use clothing so when you take a close

267
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,060
interest or

268
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,860
couple end up getting sold in your
neighborhood in one min ends up getting

269
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,209
exported largely to African cities where

270
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,029
the problem there is becoming that the
local textile industries have become

271
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:10,920
very depressed

272
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,310
the same thing is happening I'm
particularly in Africa tech industries

273
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,779
there's some really really smart people
and there's

274
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,339
just not the opportunity for them to
compete with you coming imports and

275
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,260
sneak new stuff there's a healthy reduce
market

276
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,910
but there's just not receive opportunity
for innovation

277
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,420
we've had am

278
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,500
when workers are going to this they take
on all sorts of risks we've gone through

279
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,139
some

280
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,130
some chemicals that that people face
when disassembling and some other bad

281
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,820
ones are

282
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,240
fumes when you're deciding people are
are you instead using

283
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,040
herds Richard just live has Richard not
available

284
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,439
in backyard processing facilities and I
really do mean just people's backyards

285
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,529
and people often used just kinda house
fans to try and blow the fuse away from

286
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:00,300
their faces

287
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,910
I've never seen a picture anyone wearing
a respirator a couple times i've seen

288
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,170
someone could hold

289
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,940
handkerchief to their hands while
they're working on this stuff

290
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,079
but at the workers you take this on

291
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,180
for us are putting themselves an
incredible risk

292
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,190
I'm kids are splashy through the lead

293
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,440
curtains this year to stick it to them
the copper York

294
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,320
you and there are some people who have
gotten so good at identifying classics

295
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,060
that they can

296
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,709
they can't be understand which kinda
plastic you're dealing with by this now

297
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,970
if they burn company which is incredible
skill

298
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,829
so I'm here's some pictures

299
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:42,160
so this is at this is the kind of
situation than

300
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,199
our computers are finding themselves in

301
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,000
here's a woman taking off piana the
O'Connell CRT to get to you the cut

302
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,740
copper asses waterway

303
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,279
you can imagine that that water is
probably extremely acidic

304
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,720
and I wanna pop over to this before I go
back to that quote and to skydive

305
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,770
mentioned that discussed it

306
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,730
this what we're looking at right here
this is America non-economic

307
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,720
justice this is the definition of it
this is

308
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,209
a group of people and in one situation
finding that the

309
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,679
are choosing not to you or the cannot
afford to you

310
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,600
take care problem understanding it to a
place that

311
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,610
through limited options is will do it
for us

312
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,059
quarter the quote that I really like is
from and German teams

313
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,879
she know better and he's this founder
and editor and

314
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,549
magazine leaders call technology times
and cookers

315
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:51,010
what Africa needs is to be able to
evolve its own information technology

316
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,750
industry

317
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,929
to support its own local system builders
to be able to evolve its own local

318
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,260
computers to be able to write code in
its own

319
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,260
local languages to meet its own local
need

320
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,730
Africa does not need the used equipment
coming in from the north

321
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,679
to come in here and continue to pose
long-term long-term threats to our

322
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,539
environment

323
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,080
so I'm gots this is

324
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,449
Mike the tough part have where are we
stand up and this is why

325
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,220
we're interested looking more carefully
at life cycle analysis

326
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,280
and regulations and what we need to be
doing next

327
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,970
I'm before a move on what I want to do
is kinda choose your own adventure

328
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,840
and at this point I can go in and start
talking a little bit more about life

329
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,230
cycle analysis and

330
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,530
the amount of material required and to

331
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,910
to create my computer for example too
soon we have an idea of what

332
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,789
what massive and materials for looking
at

333
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,390
or I think I know if Brees threw
something at get to you

334
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,940
and the part where I'm we really need
good ideas

335
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,380
and extend the question and answer
period so

336
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,870
so I guess what races are Richard
discussion or

337
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,760
private your body information on its
view

338
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,350
with the letter just real quick

339
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,950
can I get a tech um

340
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,179
thank you awesome so Paul I'm

341
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:25,910
discussion verses and more talk
discussion

342
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,910
okay more talk

343
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,169
okay I'm to to it there will be question
answer at the end

344
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:38,780
I just feel a little shorter okay thank
you so much appreciate that

345
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,740
okay so let's talk about life cycle
analysis I am

346
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,309
so when we talk about life cycle we can
talk about it on and also

347
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,410
text you can do whatever you want the
lights and find your way

348
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,150
and so we talk about life cycle analysis
the best thing that we can talk about

349
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,500
is start with the inception of the
product

350
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,309
I understand what materials and energy
and resources went into it

351
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,590
understand what where resource use goes
into to

352
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,949
useful life of the product how it's
going to be disposed of and how that

353
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,900
wraps around

354
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,830
to get recycled and admitted to you a
new product

355
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,139
I'm so that's the best way to talk about
life cycle analysis you

356
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,750
was invoke a couple years ago to you be
really progressive and talk about cradle

357
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,900
to grave

358
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,990
which was instead of just looking at the
use face which was

359
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,080
I'm the popular thing to do prior to
that a to to look at that inception and

360
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,570
all the way to disposal

361
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm so that's that's better than nothing
but more or less what we do more talking

362
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,270
about electronic waste as we really are
talking about

363
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,210
I'm the inception of the product and
then I would have stopped thinking about

364
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,710
it

365
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,740
once the wrist once the check has been
signed conspiracy has been generated

366
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,059
I'm just and and richard is a lot since

367
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,280
curious engineer type 2 here so just a
curiosity and sent it to put the same

368
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,940
here

369
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,130
am so this is what goes into you

370
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,120
a silicon chip I'm so that's a silicon
we've got some things that I can't

371
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,770
pronounce

372
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,850
and that some chemical and hot water
pure gases family end up with this big

373
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,470
way for which then gets chopped down
into individual ships and stamped with

374
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,600
whenever it's gonna be I'm so

375
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,789
thats kind of the stuff because into a
chip

376
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,879
I'm I'm gonna redo these these chemicals
but

377
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,130
I'm there's a lot of consonants

378
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,510
Anna so at their about five hundred to a
thousand chemicals

379
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,299
they going to do that manufactures have
a computer

380
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:37,780
am and it turns out that this is stuff
that you don't want your hair

381
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,220
you know when you water and you
definitely don't want it in your tissue

382
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,570
but it's getting there %uh to
manufacture requires a lot of water said

383
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,418
there's a lot of solvents there's a lot
of FAM equ s and liquid stuff

384
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:52,549
I wanted to be from sent Silicon Valley
and

385
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:55,809
disorders Northwest Pacific Northwest is
dealing with is leaking underground

386
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,000
storage tanks

387
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,760
so is I'm really nasty stuff we can to
the salon has been since the seventies

388
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,908
and we see flame retardant showing up
and

389
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:08,640
in biological tissue everywhere humans
and animals

390
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
you might have heard about Scotchgard
showing up in breast milk I'm

391
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,140
do some nasty stuff that comes out in
these processes when when the way stasi

392
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,500
handled properly and okay

393
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,320
so let's talk about I 32 megabyte

394
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,629
friendship I'm d because anymore sure
this

395
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,020
the study was half my 2001 or something
like that but I think

396
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,080
I think we can imagine and I'm that that
that the scale materials uses probably

397
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,000
similar

398
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,110
am okay so I

399
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,159
the energy that goes into the care and
feeding

400
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,559
I have a3 to make de RAM chip is

401
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,210
and p.m. if you 100 percent the amount
of energy that goes toward the use of

402
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,960
that is only 25 percent

403
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,010
the rest goes into into the manufacture
and and that's the case for a lot of

404
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,820
products that send

405
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,039
it's a concept called embodied energy it
took so many kilowatt hours to make this

406
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,070
notebook for example I it takes about
six thousand angels to make a computer

407
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm some semiconductor sites find that
they're using four million gallons of

408
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,539
water a day

409
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:15,110
you might note that I am as their to
manufacturers very dry states like New

410
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,280
Mexico and Arizona

411
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,770
arms and so that's just incredible are
used

412
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,918
I am okay so and it also turns out that
a lot of the stuff is just jumped before

413
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,030
it even

414
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,730
I guess of the factory floor I talked
about their confusing

415
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,900
distinction between us 19 in a small
waist earlier and

416
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,390
one of the things that confuses that
issues the fact that am seventy percent

417
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,580
of hazardous waste

418
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,918
which is not municipal waste is
electronics

419
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,919
so that stuff is coming from the factory
floor a Beach

420
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
actually assist time I khuli chana
earlier about that

421
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,750
am so we can just meet that for about

422
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,919
I for every pound of computer

423
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,419
this is like two point forty pounds or
something like that you can estimate

424
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:01,320
about two pounds of waste

425
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,270
and about a third of that be hazardous

426
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,510
so then we get passed manufacturing
stage I'm use for WoW are you now

427
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,700
onto the Twitter burden to Facebook and
on that

428
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,890
and then wrap I'm so then what we do

429
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,940
well we have a couple last actions speak
to toss it in the trash

430
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,520
and there's an 80 percent chance that
you dont up in a landfill

431
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,059
we can dump in a closet which is a
totally reasonable thing to do in fact

432
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,320
EPA has measured that on we probably as
Americans we probably have

433
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,428
over 200 million devices stashed in our
closets as a 2007

434
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:41,510
on another option is you can donate it
to you to somebody who needs it on

435
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,279
totally great thing to do it extends the
lifetime

436
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,020
for tracks it sees change for me
manufactured

437
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,158
the gives gives the thing second lease
on life hopefully help somebody else

438
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,779
the problem is the channel capacity has
been broken and now that person

439
00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:00,330
has maybe what a year three years five
years have love life left in this piece

440
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,408
of electronics and then

441
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:04,500
they're responsible for the disposal am

442
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,730
or even recycling which as we learned
earlier to be really sticky

443
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,809
annual talk a little bit about why that
is fine I'm

444
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,379
I a lot of recyclers are actually mostly
exporters

445
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,400
so how do you find a reasonable recycler
how you find a reputable recycler

446
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,590
in the US it's a little tough one of the
things that you can do is go to

447
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,770
a reputable voluntary auditing an
organization

448
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,520
the one that I like is musician called
eastwards

449
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,059
good Easter eggs at work and find an
audited recycler

450
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,460
and I like them because Silicon Valley
toxics coalition like spam

451
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,840
and I really like them so I think that
they seem to be the most reputable

452
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,059
on voluntary on any system in the US

453
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:50,220
but we still think that we're exporting
about to and

454
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,230
at least to 10.29 computers just as a
2002

455
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,270
I'm sure the numbers gonna okay but is
that really obsolete every series the

456
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,750
classic and

457
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,340
it is I we can reach the class there is
domestic and recycling facilities for

458
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:06,929
that

459
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:10,179
classic is really tough and just
recently there's am there's

460
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,250
been with an uptick and

461
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,809
in the market for recycled plastics
because am

462
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,750
computer manufacturers have caught onto
the screen thing and now they wanna

463
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,919
they wanna advertise that they have like
recycled content computers that are

464
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,820
calling up recyclers be like

465
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,750
Haiti has a recycled plastic for snow
like no we didn't think you wanted it

466
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,059
was sent to china

467
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:34,740
and so even when you read what she have
to wait for the market to catch up with

468
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,490
you

469
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,779
am and it turns out that the market is
that way because one

470
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:43,100
one number that we have is that it's ten
times more profitable to export monitor

471
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,370
honest Ram processor here that is

472
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,340
leaving us with the beauty whole areas
trade imbalance where we for exporting

473
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,400
some technology to dress the world are
actually exporting more technology trash

474
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,240
an actual new technology

475
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,720
here's another person onto the life
cycle so instead have

476
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,250
incentive i buy my laptop and I use it

477
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,130
sure the Twitter and Facebook for a
little while and then I put it in my

478
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,110
basement arguments my niece

479
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,179
to the chicken an Ubuntu so cute so in

480
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:16,789
if instead of doing that why don't what
I signed a contract with

481
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:20,679
with Toshiba that says in three years
they're going to give me a new laptop in

482
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,740
nineteen fifty bucks on to whatever

483
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,260
on and and instead of owning the object

484
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,230
I'm going to use if the object
interesting

485
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,490
you any UN Environment Programme you
researchers

486
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,789
particularly in Germany are release met
with this idea and i really wanna make

487
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:37,690
it work

488
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,000
it seems to be working for the solar
panel industry on the

489
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,149
saying cutencomfy cost solar panels is
just ridiculously high

490
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:50,350
but programs where where companies are
leasing solar house homeowners

491
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,460
and homeowner pays a lower electricity
bill

492
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,149
in return for the solar panel company
getting the extra money that

493
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:00,539
comes back from the electric company
finisher power generation that seems to

494
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,350
actually be

495
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,350
working am we'll have to see if it if it
withstands the economic tides finance

496
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,120
CZ decent model wanna have fun swiftly
saying

497
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,539
on in addition to lots of consumer

498
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,779
them perception ideas is that

499
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,809
it kind of goes against the makers
static I'm if i cant

500
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:23,870
rip apart my my laptop put things in it
that point guard

501
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,570
you know scanned your brainstem or
whatever then i cant consider it mind if

502
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,710
I had to get a better to achieve an
Aston be in some format that they'll

503
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,380
don't accept back so their problems at
the leasing montana

504
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,649
is worth considering and

505
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:43,510
the Louisiana also to is referred to in
some in some situations as an example ft

506
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,870
materialization

507
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,679
where where you stopped as I said

508
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,000
you stocked I'm imagining your computing

509
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,890
as I think that you own and rather it's
a service that you

510
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,679
that your friends and super super old
school

511
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,980
made friends yet like I can use a charge
by the CP cycle

512
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,090
and there's gotta be somebody to me hear
you

513
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,270
you have been in any way in any case
apparently that was the case

514
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,510
so we could do that I'm but there are
other

515
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,140
others ways to think about this i dnt
materialization

516
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,669
I'm so me you know cell phones are tiny
and computers are getting smaller and

517
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:25,230
doesn't this mean that we're treating
less waste like when I put this in a

518
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,730
landfill it's my right

519
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,840
so this must be better it's must be
greener main I'm getting marcy

520
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,080
I'm team are cycles per kilowatt-hour
that must be getting

521
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,850
I'm but it turns out that I'm as you
said before

522
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,200
on for every pound of this there's two
pounds of waste

523
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,279
and for every one of these you can
imagine

524
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,309
that 630 if these represent the mass
that was required to make the final

525
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:50,809
product

526
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:55,559
I'm microchip that's two grams might
require sixteen hundred grams a few on

527
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,450
chemicals to you

528
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,750
to create it so we haven't really

529
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,440
de material highest which is a point
that a researcher named Eric William

530
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,070
makes and I just love this quote I was
likes Mikey was there in the middle the

531
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,779
financial crisis analysts like have my
fangs and I love this quote

532
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,630
he says our point was and is simply that
the amount of materials used to

533
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,640
manufacture computer chip these days is
hundreds

534
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,980
if not thousands of times greater than
the quantity actually embodied in the

535
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,929
chip

536
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:28,240
this makes a way to the children s
leading indicator the materials used and

537
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,480
it means that people

538
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,779
like alan greenspan and France's CAC
Ross who have

539
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:35,990
site in microelectronics as an example
after radical

540
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,860
d materialization have misunderstood the
situation

541
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,770
another way to think about this is in
the is the information economy really in

542
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,418
the ether

543
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,679
now it's not and I know that because I
managed San

544
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,539
you it's a big chunk hardware

545
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:56,270
okay so maternal the surround what if
manufactures

546
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:01,269
I'm took out took out their own trash
why should I pay for HP did to our

547
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:07,350
to to take care of its own waste and I
totally have the wrong version of this

548
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,450
I've this Sat presentation here and I
know that because I totally

549
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,730
shot at my friend John McKnight here if
had talked earlier

550
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,850
on a producer take back I'm yet the idea
here is that

551
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,340
if if your producer if you manufacture
is the one responsible for the waste

552
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,899
that slips are these economic models
totally around

553
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:30,230
they start thinking about the importance
of buildings things and that they can be

554
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,299
taken apart

555
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:33,970
they start thinking about the toxicity
they start thinking about

556
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,519
standardization and

557
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,539
how long they wanna meet their materials
last rather than how short the can

558
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:39,970
possibly make them last

559
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,330
so I refer you to at a recording if his
talk for

560
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,460
more for a richer explanation from the
idea producer take back

561
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,750
am okay so despues you take back stuff
makes so much sense when using this

562
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,120
am the problem is toxicity is cheap

563
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,120
for some definition of cheap and this is
where we get back to her

564
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,409
justice again it's expensive for us in
the US

565
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:08,169
because Americans are environment
largely and because the where economy

566
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:08,710
works

567
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,890
to process the stuff I'm reasonably and
well in safely

568
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,019
%uh so we pass the costs onto

569
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,190
on to other people and other places and
we saw

570
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,470
we saw pictures of how that works so
basically this is the idea

571
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,440
behind externalizing costs on if you've
heard people say that haven't quite

572
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,460
gotten

573
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,049
Kelly kind of hold on to that concept
that's what that means

574
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:35,690
it means that we've decided that we're
not going to pay for that and

575
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,390
we're gonna put the cost on to somebody
else in the form have toxicity

576
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,460
I'm carcinogens any others

577
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,760
Serta bad situations

578
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,059
am now so there you go I didn't drop
mister johnnie go

579
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:52,918
oMG sOooo extended producer
responsibility is is a good way to

580
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:53,970
approach this

581
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,820
am it turns out that out that some
manufacturers are really looking forward

582
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,649
to this they would

583
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:00,960
they would like to have many and
producer take back on

584
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,090
because if there were some sir if
they're fact that could bring design

585
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,159
standards and if they were designed
standards

586
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,419
and they could take anybody's computer
back in making a computer out a bit

587
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:13,990
and it turns out that even industry
wants regulation I've heard this

588
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:18,200
several times throughout my ass from my
coursework where someone from some

589
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,570
industry will come and

590
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,080
I and say we we'd need to be regulated
we want to be regulated

591
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,809
and there are a couple situations under
which that happens one is when there's

592
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:33,340
ambiguity in the law and/or ambiguity
and PE tensions in washington

593
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,750
so if manufactures ur whatever
corporations

594
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,799
are trying to guess at what the
government is gonna is going to regulate

595
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,668
next

596
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:44,309
they have a really hard time in the end
up spending money in inappropriate ways

597
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:47,750
an end up wasting it so they did really
just rather know up front what are you

598
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,179
gonna regularly so that we can just go
for it

599
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:54,169
and the other reason that is really
sweet body type the the situation and

600
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:54,880
Richard

601
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,299
industry likes regulation is when
there's an even playing field in a

602
00:33:59,299 --> 00:33:59,730
certain

603
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,029
that's certainly the case feel the
electronic waste

604
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,330
so if everybody had to do things the
right way then

605
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,399
you wouldn't be losing competitive
advantage over the other company down

606
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:11,629
the street who's not doing things the
right way

607
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:15,049
%uh there's also a statistic that looked
at on four

608
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,740
Ford state legislation programs and
found out that

609
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,480
I just dead weight. cost having for
individual programs rather than

610
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,329
one day umbrella federal program was
like twenty-five million dollars a year

611
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:27,119
so

612
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,280
there's a sack chief others just
operation costs

613
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,450
in on in not having an overarching
system

614
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,980
so what regulations in force to do we
have arm

615
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,530
so yeah me skit for

616
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,770
out doing okay so will start about

617
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,099
mention the Basel Convention is I

618
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:51,909
to treat it was agreed to in 1992

619
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,020
their 172 parties to it I am

620
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,369
it was E the the convention came
together in 1989 a response to %uh

621
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:02,950
be toxic spill in Nigeria that happen in
1988

622
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,240
in you considered the gold standard
international hazardous waste treaties

623
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,180
an it governs the the generation
management and the movement

624
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,980
waste across across national borders and
and

625
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,950
you'll never guess who's not a signatory
to the ski

626
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,069
actually that's a good question I act
and you know

627
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:30,000
I believe that yet it's yet because some
yes I think you're right

628
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,579
right but the US is not a signatory

629
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,510
and Berna okay so over it and the EU

630
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,170
the EU said has the gold standard
regulatory environment for

631
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,829
around electronic waste and what people
earn

632
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:49,690
and I'm still doing some research into
longer-term attacks in this review

633
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,470
these regulations but they look like
they're starting to slowly have the

634
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,530
effect that was intended

635
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,480
they have two big regulations that
govern the stuff from one is called we

636
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,490
I which is waste electrical and
electronic %uh equipment

637
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,510
and that portion of the regulatory
environment

638
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,280
I handles and manufactures possibility
so they already have producers

639
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,920
possibility the other big one is our
gross I've heard people calling

640
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,849
bro Haas ROS all sorts of things I call
it roasts

641
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:22,310
because why not it's the restriction
hazardous substances and what it says is

642
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,140
that starting in 2002

643
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,598
you've got to start looking at your cut
your toxic content you've got to start

644
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,920
point something out

645
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,720
on Ross is the reason that we have on
non lead solder

646
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,099
in any electronics on and its retarded
and is really interesting

647
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:40,670
to flip the globalization that happens
when when rescue in fact

648
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,160
I'm you can read about this in a book on
high-tech trash where

649
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,960
someone from Dallas talking about how
when rose came into effect

650
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,880
they found out that what they decided
that it wasn't gonna be worthwhile to

651
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,930
split their

652
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,910
I'm their production lines into the
European market and the rest of the

653
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,509
world

654
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,650
so they just upgraded everything so now
the entire world is benefiting

655
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,920
ostensibly from from the regulations
that are in place in Europe

656
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,310
I just think this is the most honorable
thing it's a really smart too small we

657
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,940
containers

658
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,650
and its suitable for the collection a
small leaf

659
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,530
should okay so what's happening in the
US I'm

660
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:26,119
so we have this law it's called the CRT
reliance feats really

661
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,839
insufficient has socks even the
Government Accountability Office 10 the

662
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,849
did a study on this site on this year
she role in 2008

663
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:37,980
the spiritual attempts to sort it do
some other things that the Basel

664
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,579
the and deposit much much to do on at
the

665
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,900
I'm and only for CAT scans their

666
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,020
every the important part we stream am

667
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,030
and so whether China's for the trying to
do is and say okay so if I'm a nation

668
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,829
that has asserted

669
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:57,950
be great level ability to handle my
erased and i cant send it to a level d

670
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,550
country have to send to appear above

671
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,859
and so did the CAT roles says this
essentially

672
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:08,140
but there's kind if no way to enforce it
and and is really insufficient because

673
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,210
there's a lot of electronics and I left
out of this

674
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:15,089
so when the Government Accountability
Office looked over this role in 2008

675
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:16,599
they said a couple things they said

676
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,630
come on EPA's seriously you treat US as
hazardous waste

677
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,980
this is really silly there's some really
interesting person environmental US from

678
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,980
now on and make it such that if I
through a computer it's not hazardous

679
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,619
waste

680
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:31,390
but if my employer throws it away the
same computer it is hazardous waste

681
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,250
so Josa industry is hazardous waste cuz
its hazardous

682
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,510
they're also saying ratify the camp as a
convention already come on

683
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,030
either also saying for enforcement to to
prevent someone is

684
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,640
mass exports work with Customs and
Border Protection Act that the only way

685
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,190
that you're gonna

686
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,720
time you gonna be able to track any the
stuff

687
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,390
but states are picking up where the
federal government has not

688
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,368
as irv just last month this is just a
stat from June

689
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:02,020
and 23 states have US loss that means a
61 percent of our population is covered

690
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,130
by some sort

691
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:07,160
producer take back or something some
sort of law that covers the way so

692
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,500
we're getting there

693
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,440
so arm when I did I little sort of
roundtable discussion on this topic has

694
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,839
76 a couple months ago

695
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,630
and one of the things that people were
really interested in talking about was

696
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,180
mandatory sisters Frances voluntary
efforts

697
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,299
and you were really excited about
voluntary efforts and

698
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,430
the reasoning being when the market
drives an effort there's there's

699
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,060
motivation

700
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,930
there's am there's impetus behind it
that you just you just don't get the

701
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,779
same kind

702
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm enthusiasm might say when you when
you're be forced

703
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,400
by some military role to tax in certain
way

704
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,910
and thats I totally reasonable argument
and in some places it works

705
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,109
but what I found and stand read it on a
bunch of places

706
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:54,060
my hunch has been and my reading has has
confirmed that

707
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,210
voluntary efforts just don't get the job
done under too susceptible to changes in

708
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:03,849
in the market they just don't do it on
but there are lotsa voluntary effort out

709
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:04,180
there

710
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,549
easter is image is my favorite one GPA
has a couple their

711
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,780
down decent efforts I'm and there are a
lot of voluntary

712
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,829
programs that you can look into

713
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:19,540
so what can we do is check workers we
can get some systemic solutions and we

714
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,910
can look at what we can do

715
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,009
so I'm how do we fix this stuff

716
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,780
and you the fixes are actually very
simple like when you think about when

717
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,990
you go through it logically

718
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,920
that the answers are very simple all we
have to do is get rid a planned

719
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,150
obsolescence cuz it's a really big
problem

720
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,050
next let's make Cradle to Cradle
processing profitable by

721
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,849
by a change in the way we interact with
our commodities markets I'm lets rate

722
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:45,599
really good regulations and I'm not some
for spam

723
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,500
complex I go to the places where people
are doing informal disassembly

724
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,240
and work with them and figure out how
weak and

725
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,589
how we can do better I'm harm reduction
the

726
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:01,140
waste processing with people who are
actually doing in the field

727
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,299
and last but ships you know pop up some
really good

728
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,800
recycling facilities that take the stuff
apart on a meeting at Safeway have

729
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,480
really gets covers incinerators on and
just yeah all the stuff is really simple

730
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,140
on except then I mean yeah let's

731
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,118
dismantle planned obsolescence search
reminds you that steve martin's kitman

732
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,720
honorees like how do you make a million
dollars not pay any taxes

733
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,680
first get a million dollars mark yeah
this the solutions are very

734
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,810
are simple but they're not easy at all

735
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,109
I'm but there are lots of organizations
that ours

736
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:40,609
doing whatever they can to try and
address it Silicon Valley taxes

737
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:42,470
coalition is one of my favorites

738
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,540
the Basel Action Network is very
powerful in this in this in this arena

739
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,390
electronics take precautions another
really good one

740
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:57,299
even went on this list am these are some
some organizations and i really admire

741
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,010
but they're up against some some tough
stuff they've got all these economic

742
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,619
forces that are just not gonna change
without

743
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:06,859
all I don't know also its economic and
president understand

744
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:10,020
am I was talking to someone from region
3 at the EPA

745
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,880
and she started to think that there were
some legal underpinnings and

746
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,210
as a convention that need to be
compatible with our superfund

747
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,560
hazardous waste laws now I don't know if
that's actually the case I didn't get

748
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,650
clarification but

749
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,670
if that's the case that sir it's
complicated

750
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,829
and if non lead solder for example

751
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:31,770
I'm so replacing substances is not easy
nom insider

752
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,759
requires a higher melting point which
requires more energy input when you're

753
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,560
making

754
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,970
your equipment which requires your
circuit boards to you have

755
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,420
higher temperature tolerance which
requires et cetera et cetera

756
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,200
so replacing toxic substances is not
something he's kinda snap your fingers

757
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,450
and you

758
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,890
and enforcement is really tough just had
to chase a shipping container

759
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:56,400
around the world to a couple group
trounced

760
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,730
said there have been some kind if eat
green computers

761
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,589
leave it to you to work this out am but
what can we do

762
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:07,099
this is we r important I and we can make

763
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:10,359
a pretty big impact because we as
technology workers

764
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:13,980
those of us who are technology workers
have we r

765
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,060
the market reform the market so if we're
driving the market we can ask them

766
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,119
and force them to do what we want to do
so

767
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,720
an I'd I think a three-year contract is
silly

768
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,569
and I've been asking my vendors to give
me five year contract I'm not the only

769
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:28,750
person who thinks it's silly

770
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,589
the gartner group is also suggesting
five-year contract for deed where's

771
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:32,839
warehousing set-ups

772
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:36,349
somehow the only once a mass us there is

773
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:39,520
is a computer consultant company whose
has been hearing from there com

774
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,000
from there customers that sounds are
taking like eighteen months to deploy

775
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,930
any team must decommission which means

776
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,848
once years I don't want your three-year
contract is up like you've just kinda if

777
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:53,280
might shake your groove we can demand
that when they ship has a palette of

778
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,339
stuff to take back all their crap

779
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:58,810
we can demand that when we're done with
their equipment that day and that they

780
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,549
take their older

781
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,819
back and give us new stuff sign actually
had a very good program

782
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,800
added to that for a long time and I I
don't know if they're doing anymore I'm

783
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,300
not there

784
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,829
by Oracle's be too much gonna be really
mad

785
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:14,849
am so so say you work at the University
in yet another university down the

786
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:15,270
street

787
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,099
well as a congressman's over there and
be like hey we're making a big order

788
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,300
from down when we call it together and
tell them to take all that damn boxes

789
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,050
pack

790
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,380
so the more Tamar colleagues that you
have me he missed a massive your vendors

791
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,250
with you

792
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,520
the higher chance you have getting the
stuff through

793
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,829
I'm and use an oddity recycler the best
it's about the best we can do in the US

794
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:39,890
am when you're trying to make a change
in your organization talk to your

795
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,569
facilities people cuz those are the
people who are concerned with

796
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:46,200
on loading capacity for the concern
would he do you calling

797
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,690
so if your organization is being
influence by

798
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,880
the needs of the facilities group make
friends with you so these people find

799
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,690
out what they need

800
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,829
communicate that back to your to your
department and

801
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:59,500
in if you're in pennsylvania you're
about to face electricity deregulation

802
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,119
which means that all of a sudden

803
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,510
out power and cooling is going to be
more expensive than it once I'm

804
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:08,319
so start bringing that up in meetings be
like a huge we should really be more

805
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:08,990
efficient

806
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,130
interesting things way or you replace
them with my fishing stuff

807
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,680
am and if you're if you're looking for
more

808
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,790
impetus just do like a Google Site
Search

809
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:23,690
your company's website just look for
green or sustainable our sustainability

810
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,869
and bring that up meetings

811
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,170
if you're if there's if there's a
mandate from your organization it means

812
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,109
that you can move

813
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:33,950
even if you're even if it's just
rewatching means that it's been written

814
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,740
down and you can act on it

815
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,829
am on asking for this one to sit there
are ways to make that to me

816
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:45,020
take the argument to pay a little bit
more at the beginning on

817
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,020
t.co costs and easy

818
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,089
by a lot of calculations far outweigh
and

819
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:56,078
use costs outweigh purchase costs

820
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,329
am so this is also easy really hard to
do if your organization is just not

821
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:04,990
receptive to it but if your leadership
is going green

822
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:08,089
do it and if you're the boss you know
why not was

823
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:11,099
in the past so an at hand

824
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:14,300
we've we've got a you know we've got a
big mandate from the present University

825
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,050
and

826
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:19,089
none of us who are taking action in this
field really care if she cares what we

827
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:21,380
know is that there's a mandate its on
the website

828
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,060
as planned Anna and we're gonna take
action based on that

829
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,099
so shears where you come in and talk
about this issue and your friends we

830
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:30,990
need brains

831
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,599
on a couple of issues we need materials
engineers to start thinking about safer

832
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,230
and nontoxic materials

833
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,329
we need designers to be thinking about
Cradle to Cradle processing

834
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:43,819
I'm we need marketers and and people
with a really good I'm wooden nickels

835
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:44,790
feel

836
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:49,079
to convince manufacturers and customers
to think a little harder about

837
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,599
about electronic waste land site
electronic life cycle

838
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,720
we need harm reduction processing out in
the field we need people who are good at

839
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,750
appropriate technology to go into the
field

840
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,069
and tell us on tell us but work for the
people who were

841
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:06,319
you're doing this kind of work and I'm
and try and make it

842
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,470
less harmful we need I better economic
models

843
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:13,589
obviously What's Trending wanted this is
the money the money is not flying in the

844
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:15,640
right directions not going in the right
places

845
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,420
we need to fix it and we need economists
you know what they're going to do that

846
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,920
we need policy brains on better
regulation and better enforcement

847
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,309
am this is really interesting to me so

848
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:30,619
we have a really long latest electronic
waste from the computer industry

849
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:34,839
and their industries that come on from
this I'm the one that obvious that the

850
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:38,450
pops to mind most this really is the
solar panel industry

851
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,589
there using a lot in the same substances
and

852
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:45,299
and design techniques as src circuit
boards

853
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,430
so with the uptick in popularity of
Seoul house for gonna see them

854
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,690
and dealing with a lot of the same
problems and ten or twenty years

855
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:56,780
and V communicate that they're an
industry that

856
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,160
that has a conscious a conscience a ban
environmental issues

857
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,618
so they may be receptive to hearing
about the lessons that we find from the

858
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,119
electronics industry and

859
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,059
implement some of these things on the
front I'm nanotech

860
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:13,450
I've got myself into a tizzy I'm for the
past three days I can touch my

861
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,410
housemates about his

862
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:18,270
you know thing but not attack so in 2007

863
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,349
I'm Silicon Valley taxes coalition did a
study

864
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:24,750
where they took every part from IBM from
Mikes

865
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,770
thirty years ago and looks at

866
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,790
looked at industry data and issue
reports from an attic industry

867
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,230
sky went through point by point and
showed how similar

868
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:38,710
a position those two industries were and
are

869
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,650
now we were at the I with their the
argument that they were making use at

870
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:43,680
the nanotech industry

871
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,118
is where the computer and she was thirty
years ago and

872
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,800
if we can extrapolate and if we can use
the precautionary principle

873
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,410
we can see that we've new very well may
be facing a lot

874
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,520
have issues have unintended consequences
and bad

875
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,790
on bad design bad planning if we don't
think about an attack

876
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:05,779
pretty hard now and last thing is
biofuels

877
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:10,270
and so if anybody's ever made any
homebrew and biodiesel you know the end

878
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,329
up with like a bunch of fuel and a bunch
of like

879
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,569
view like to be like like all stuff I'm
that happens with a lot of

880
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:20,430
on a lot of biofuels and fortunately
that least is a little easier to deal

881
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:25,190
with cheese is pretty simple hydrocarbon
chains and the easier to convert into

882
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:29,809
for that waste into a waste that you can
use physically makes makes simpson stuff

883
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,260
out of your bio diesel least

884
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,960
on and their other biodiesel waste and
they're being converted into different

885
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,089
types of fuels

886
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:41,578
also being I'm being derived different
hydrocarbon be stuff is be derived

887
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,130
as a little bit less have was a
nightmare scenario to me

888
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:49,650
but it is some it if younger I think we
could use a little bit if I

889
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:54,170
am so some my favorite sources high-tech
trash by Elizabeth Grossman is

890
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,589
just a great great book she's a
journalist who

891
00:49:57,589 --> 00:50:00,819
did a very good job getting to all the
facts and figures of the issue but she

892
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:02,270
also did a really excellent job

893
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,390
understanding the scope she did
everything from

894
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,790
I'm from understanding them the life
cycle and how much

895
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,859
%uh how much materials goes into a chip

896
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:15,109
to the implications for prison labor in
the US she's

897
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:18,950
went everywhere she did a really good
job so I would recommend all of these

898
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,579
are the sources

899
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:25,079
I'm and one more source in about a week
and check on skin deep I'm

900
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,099
under green thumb teach and gonna

901
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:32,050
post this ads this presentation and I'm
gonna try and include the notes

902
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:35,940
in the notes on a train cue my research
and ass a minute segment

903
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,700
on my sources so if you want to do more
on my research into this you're welcome

904
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,470
to do that

905
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,160
I'm please feel free to get touched me
anytime you want I'll be around

906
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,009
on weekends and and please come visit
had 76

907
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,530
and I'm really eager to you here he had
to say in here

908
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:58,530
what you're interested in 7 Mikes

909
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,520
damaged here Stephanie first ball

910
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,770
thank you for providing doctors

911
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,740
hand with all the information the

912
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:27,020
to cure my cancer UK

913
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,480
so on maybe if I by cancer once

914
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,869
I'll survive again but a it seems to me
that there must be a parallel

915
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:41,369
between all chemicals

916
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,700
are needed to are may call

917
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,359
stuff and the chemicals the are needed

918
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,640
to get the valuable stuff back our

919
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:57,230
so there may be a parallel between

920
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:00,440
consumer in business waste

921
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,020
and the manufacturing process

922
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,559
and there which cracks sure you know
nurse and

923
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,660
an ass a phase-out material

924
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,058
some that may can't review to

925
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:17,500
process to you know like i was thinkin

926
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,109
you know disassembly you know I'm
thinking like a sawmill

927
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:25,020
yeah like you know you don't we're not
going to put it back together again

928
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,650
you know we're just trying to get at the
components you know so

929
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,920
some sort a collaborative effort maybe
in zones around the country

930
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,280
you know as you said $25 million have
that way

931
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,250
toward year round so I mean these must
be thoughts that

932
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,619
you've at Arabian yeah I ask himself
silly to a discussion

933
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,609
case me some cool with the
hundred-year-old I

934
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:51,930
yet what the point you're making is a
very good one and it's one that gets

935
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:53,609
considered by the industry a lot

936
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:57,140
answer I think the part of your question
is onto some have output if these

937
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,839
destructive processes p.m. puts into
some minutes

938
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:05,569
some in the solution and and again on a
chemist and Nana

939
00:53:05,569 --> 00:53:10,480
and and industrial engineer but yes
there is opportunity for that for sure

940
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,000
one of the problems is matching up to
producer with fiction with the consumer

941
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,300
and getting the quantities right so okay
on

942
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,930
so with it so those relationships are
kind of hard to mount

943
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:26,540
on but its own its its something to look
into future

944
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,839
I will let alone time but ya go for it
okay really quickly

945
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,529
back in my home state in North Dakota
rent an organization which took root

946
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:37,970
reservist computers from our school and
given to

947
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:42,180
to you know dispossessed populations in
the community

948
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,069
we were able to get computers for free
space for free

949
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:49,619
was ideally you know setup however

950
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:53,819
inevitably there's trash and so what we
found was the only thing that we would

951
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,660
ever have to pay for

952
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,618
was trashing spirit fixture post-mortem

953
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:05,240
in a small community what could I have
done possibly to do that without

954
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,530
an anchor and costs without incurring
any and

955
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,119
because they have greater yeah in the
end it just ended up being

956
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,490
driving dogs to the dumpster throwing
things in rem

957
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,750
yeah it's horribly not not the best
solution I'm

958
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,640
its E some people might argue that it's
actually not or solution

959
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:29,430
but I E I don't have an easy answer to
that because I am an advocate if

960
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,650
have pain to do it the right way but I

961
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,990
completely sympathize with on

962
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,400
with with the idea that when you're
working on a research situation

963
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,760
first just not a good solution to that I
guess I would look for good funding

964
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,180
if you maybe some other some an
organization centered on

965
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,400
computers might be interested in paid 20
bucks to

966
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,160
to recycle it correctly that on there
are a couple have an

967
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,069
retailers who will take your computer
freak steeples

968
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:04,180
Aspire something

969
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,200
I just like to point out a couple of
unintended consequences

970
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,809
the whole world loss translation yeah
I'm really just miss the foremost would

971
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,299
be

972
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:15,280
really rather stupid that you end up
with two products do the exact same

973
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:15,910
thing

974
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,089
if but have a different part number
rights and he pushed people who are now

975
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:22,390
convinced me to order this new one even
though it's not different at all

976
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:26,569
set the solder was built with the other
thing is with the the lead free solder

977
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:29,599
their are potential reliability issues

978
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,990
liability even my son reliability rather
liability

979
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:36,640
okay tin whiskers are the foremost over

980
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,859
metal to form crystals grow over time
and eventually cause shorts

981
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:45,058
Frank that with the combination ship
packages or use nowadays

982
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:48,970
ball grid array PGA is the one where you
you can see depends accept their

983
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,030
attorneys

984
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,140
okay it floats on a grid of little
solder balls essentially

985
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,319
key arm we have a whole lot of cum
component leads there now in close

986
00:55:57,319 --> 00:55:58,480
proximity

987
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,710
and if you have crystals grow between
evolves and you have a short

988
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:05,839
or 2i opens at are tied together and
possibly for fire

989
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,839
of well probably not a failure in any
event

990
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:12,308
and that could adversely affect
especially military electronics relief

991
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:13,799
in critical

992
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:17,150
yeah I am aware that than a there's a
whole movement

993
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,220
thats and frantically anti entries honor

994
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,930
at least right now although all the
script that goes through the US

995
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:28,040
mostly is broken down to the circuit
board level

996
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,250
but not beyond it okay are shipped
overseas okay

997
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,270
I'd really like to talk to you about
this untouched

998
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:38,990
iight for sho even the gentleman who's
running the show stymie to

999
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:44,140
rapper one quick final comment arm about
what it large organization can do

1000
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,250
what you're alluding to if they want to
better manage their their

1001
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,480
ok there obsolescence and the electronic
components

1002
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,809
is a good include in their procurement
contract yeah it's

1003
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:56,650
at the manifest and I think a University
Massachusetts maybe the calm of the

1004
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,760
Massachusetts have done things like that

1005
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,910
22 required to manufacture to pay for
the pickup you know

1006
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,089
yeah take responsibility for it so
that's one option absolutely

1007
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:05,880
thank you so much
