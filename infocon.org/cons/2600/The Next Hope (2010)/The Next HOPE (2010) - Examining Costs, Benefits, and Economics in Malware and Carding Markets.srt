00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,960
that could have some application and 10
percent sold

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,080
ICQ numbers which is odd given that I
see is free but lots of people's

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,869
numbers have different with length
number combinations centers

you yessir time on botnets

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,439
so in other words leasing out about say
us with that under cybercrime services

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,380
so if your leasing for D selling span
services anything that is directly

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,340
related to you

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,840
the facilitation types cybercrime

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,610

specifically state this is for spam

things to help facilitate worse bread
now our three different markets were

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,670
also available

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,960
these were the cheapest things that we
found within the marketplace

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,860
people also sold iframes we iframe
traffic

20

upload download different peoples now
where this could be listed as a service

22
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,150
we included under this category just
based on the notion selling either

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,950
iframes where range in terms of price

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,920
there was significant variability
depending on what individuals

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,490
this is in US dollars

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,780
most the individuals listed pricing
based on US currency

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,860
a limited number based information on
rubles

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,070
or money if they listed money US we just

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,399
went with US currency the average price
per box here being 322 dollars

30
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,640
whether you are buying custom two

selling actual exploits the

34
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,590
price being three dollars there one that
actually

35
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,120
much was with critters joiners
polymorphic engines

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,110
anywhere from twenty cents to forty nine
dollars so significant variability

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,129
there the average 13 FTP

38
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,359

within iframes and Trojans at the bottom

40
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,700
the max price for Trojan five thousand
dollars break

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,140
and for as little as two dollars
depending on what you want

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,349
and in terms Trojans common thing being
offered

43
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,890
if you're the Russian community Creek

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,560
the most common ones the

different functions including the few
other programs

49
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:05,019
so within this particular build she
could still

50
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,700

well-executed design

56
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,519
nice to look at the price the critters
twenty dollars money US

57

these kinds of comments like
well-executed design

58

61
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,179
you could probably get a little bit more
for it on the market place because

62
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,750
use it quite quickly under joiner was
another

everything is done honestly average
mixes four dollars

98
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,530
this honesty trust I know it sounds were
talking about individuals

99
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,880
engaging in some activities they don't
know one another

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,770
face to face incumbent upon whether
you're gonna deliver goods are not so

101
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,639
trust is very worked mechanism for these
individuals

102
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,819
terms this is for an individual leasing

you can see the country next year and
this price you're super price 100

107
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,370
Unze web money US a month spammers are

108
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,720
over such an offer in other words you
want to work with us we're gonna give it

109
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,410
to you she

110
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,750
we also make networks for individual
requests workers

111
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:47,750
yessir question about

112
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,069
so the question is actually talk about
specifics the infrastructure

113
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:58,039
works summitted

114
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,620
this was just a generic kind of post to
elicit questions

115
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,880
some those were in the deeper part the
conversation here

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,139
remember this one in specific that
initially this

117
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,229
taste trying to get people interested
they would sometimes say

118
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,349
not specifics sometimes you get
sometimes you win

119
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:19,090
but those who provide more clarity in
there would definitely get more business

120
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,250
because

121
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:27,250
more specificity the more we can likely
trustee

122
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,930
good point yes

123
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,020
did list the name but they were using
primarily no most

124
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,109
would not say how their infrastructure
was being run they would instead

125
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,460
if you were selling a particular make
like suicide or

126
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,180
one to the other ones they would
sometimes mention it but individuals

127
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,430
were just leasing out

128
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,160
their services for spam

129
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,330
questions helped for the information

130
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:01,229
question back

131
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,680
did the form include

132
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,560
services so in other words

133
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,139
I'm not quite sure what you mean liked
or

134
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,259
where the website synonymous with forums
where they were hosted

135
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,949
hard access these are all the publicly
accessible portions

136
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,229
the forum close by important part to the
board

137
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,169
but the actual forms from are those with
relatively large reputations

138
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:32,338
like explain mother fucka so

139
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,019
no these are not the clothes forms but
these are at least inside

140
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,159
is publicly accessible is raising
questions about

141
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,349
what we're actually talking about here
because if you're talking about the

142
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,330
clothes boards

143
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,279
different resources accessible or
available at least from a publicly

144
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:47,930
accessible

145
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,200
front those who don't require
registration or were paid

146
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,649
accessed so really saying something
about these forms

147
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:02,310
yes

148
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,420
in terms the customers these individuals
are somewhat hard to say

149
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,910
since all the posts were in Russian that
we analyze the assumption to be these

150
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,709
are individuals

151
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,830
either living in Russia work former
Soviet republics

152
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,790
or possibly russians living in the US we
did not see

153
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,709
US posts these posts English if one were
made

154
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,200
they were either directed to the English
subsection or their comments were

155
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,019
ignored

156
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,209
so my supposition would be these might
be russian citizens living in the US but

157
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,050
at least

158
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:37,420
discussions organ forensically was to be
somewhere

159
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,349
moving be on the malware side in terms
services

160
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,529
most common thing word services

161
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,220
by spam and proxies the pricing for
these

162
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,990
items was relatively very just example

163
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,880
what we saw in terms spam good the forum

164
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,589
price for a million delivered mail
starting at one hundred dollars

165
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,360
and the price drops real fast
practically to ten dollars for regular

166
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,670
clients selection countries is free that
issue regular clients is something that

167
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,750
came up quite a bit

168
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,839
more often you work with an individual
the more likely they were to give you

169
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,760
some kind

170
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,069
great disc so trust helps to drive

171
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,360
much cheaper prices this is another
example spam

172
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,680
advertisement in the middle you'll see
the pricing

173
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,959
120 for $1 million in boxes 150 if you
wanna broken up by certain countries

174
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,660
US Australian Centre they could do jobs

175
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,730
expand what you want from 1000 K

176
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,800
with daily database updates so there are
some bright

177
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,390
here different resources at your
disposal in terms is

178
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,019
on the web hosting side this individual
was posting an advertisement for their

179
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,680
own IP space

180
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,529
Hong Kong talked about the access that
you can yet

181
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,760
their services were available and Moscow

182
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,240
Hong Kong the US Malaysia and this
bottom line here money back for

183
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,190
dedicated service is only possible

184
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,290
if there's unavailability server

185
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,349
artful in other words this is our
problem will give your money back

186
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,089
if you screw up somehow that your own
probe when it comes to

187
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,420
web hosting this is the one thing we're
individuals relatively specific

188
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,610
about the illegality their products

189
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,769
so this top post your categorically
prohibited use our resources

190
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:28,260
for child porn zoofilia sites that
promote violence

191
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,260
projects aimed at breaking in the
government organizations and executive

192
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,510
branch bodies

193
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,790
but the individual I'd like to offer
your attention for hosting services

194
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,410
for resources with non-standard logs

195
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,410
its Trojans where's adults drug products

196
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,110
spam and others we'll take whatever you
want you just

197
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,160
me so there some variability in terms
these different webster's

198
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,459
if you want someone is going to help you
engage in something that's particularly

199
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:59,250
you can find within the marketplace some
individuals

200
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,800
effort packing services in these were
primarily geared toward breaking into

201
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
email or in some cases doing some sort

202
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,510
web-based but terms overall packing
services they were somewhat limited

203
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,959
since kinda Russian up against the time
skip to

204
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,399
which is nice another 15

205
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,220
okay 30 slides try to pretty quick

206
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,810
interns st this is just a nice example

207
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,779
earlier the pricing is based on how long
you want

208
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:35,019
attack to take place %uh for an hour and
fifteen dollars forty-eight hours

209
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,329
280 difficult projects are negotiable

210
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:42,019
energy organized using box and this is
really talk about

211
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,190
undergirding infrastructure Headley this
code at the bottom large quantity

212
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,620
mine money grows every day located time
bills

213
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,320
which allows the just work 24 hours a
day here we see some specificity

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,459
structured on in terms

215
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:02,500
the economics an attack let's just say
for the sake of argument

216
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,459
we wanted to buy access providers

217
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:11,360
the for was fourteen dollars and
twenty-six

218
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,899
cents per hour so based 24-hour attack

219
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,329
342 dollars a day said

220
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:22,100
3 attack were talking about a thousand
dollars are

221
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,170
if you look d lost metrics from the CSI

222
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,860
FBI survey its around 14,000 889 dollars

223
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,500
her respond now that's their told the
total number

224
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,980
responded 194 that's not to say this is
the exact

225
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,829
amount least and average so if we were
to invest

226
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,899
thousand dollars money to engage in this
attack what the overall net gain

227
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,230
be for us we would cause around thirteen
thousand dollars worth

228
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,610
damage within a corporate environment
now

229
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,500
attacker do we actually get any kind
value for the attack yes we disable

230
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,620
the attacker were paying somebody else
through their body

231
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,620
itself owner workers gonna make a grand

232
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,600
we're going to get some sort sense
satisfaction from the course

233
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,949
but as the individual ordering the
attack necessarily make a profit

234
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,829
if we were to blackmail the company we
were used

235
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:20,490
function to actually make the corporate
losses that are advertised here around

236
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,980
824 dollars per responded that seems
pretty low

237
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,160
if they were to pay we might make a few
grand per instance

238
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,170
not necessarily immediately obvious
happen

239
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,370
where risk detection increasing

240
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,459
we're going to blackmail someone

241
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,589
probably right I mean these companies
are smart

242
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,930
say something to some law enforcement
they're being blackmailed

243
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,529
so the risk for blackmail necessarily be
as great for us

244
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,820
if we were to try to engage in this type
of behavior begin

245
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,410
the outlays pretty low actually go
forward with the attack

246
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,000
we can at least get a little something
worthwhile out on the space

247
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
side we think about the overall cost for
spam

248
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,730
based on the information that we found
in these four the

249
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,769
last to send a single span message from
a database

250
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,149
and for sending less than a hundred
ascent

251
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,540
overall so it's very cheap to spend to
send

252
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,949
send 100000 messages the average

253
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:23,339
probably around twenty dollars depending
on what we chose spam and

254
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,760
we chose to use P so for 20 bucks

255
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,529
pretty minimal if say send 100000
Nigerians

256
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,639
messages the Prince for princess

257
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,100
some far-flung country I need you I need
your help

258
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,290
eight million dollars this country the
average dollar

259
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,569
reported by the Internet Crime Complaint
Center this is an individual

260
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,440
victim actually reporting to an agency
how much they've lost

261
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,500
and they estimate responses to be around
23 percent

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,279
overall for the individuals who receive
these messages

263
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,870
everybody in this room maybe two or
three you might actually respond

264
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,060
its very difficult thing to consider say
for the sake of argument

265
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,959
we spent 20 bucks response rate was 100
people total

266
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,740
are 100,000 email campaign at rate

267
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,519
given that the average victim 01922
dollars

268
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,980
that's a pretty significant amount of
money for responding to what's up

269
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,980
message game week

270
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,610
just under two hundred thousand dollars
neck campaign

271
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,380
know even if we only got 1e responses we
could still make at least

272
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,660
fifty thousand dollars which is money

273
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,600
when you think about the amount of time
one would have spent world to engage in

274
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,040
this campaign

275
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,370
figure few hours per respondent overtime
the

276
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,509
overall amount they're making per hour
could be somewhere around

277
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,009
nineteen thousand dollars an hour
responded to get

278
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,959
said ball messages that this is a pretty
sensible

279
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,860
from an economic point of view if
defender would

280
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,799
inter stolen data since I I didn't get
much of a chance to talk about this we

281
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,319
did see

282
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,599
harding with performs as well and the
average cost per stolen card

283
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,250
credit card or bank account was ten
dollars and 66 cents

284
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,490
her car so sake of argument if we wanted
to buy

285
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,990
100 cards from someone within this
market we paid the average

286
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,010
we'd spend a little over a thousand
dollars

287
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,629
100 cards we take the metric from the

288
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,660
I C three that individuals 209

289
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,799
dollars from credit or debit card ride

290
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,150
with in 2007 so it is here

291
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,660
let's assume that 50 the cards actually
work

292
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,480
one of the problems with carting markets
is that not every single thing the

293
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,929
is actually some sellers will replace

294
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:55,870
cards but some say whatever you not
going to help

295
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,510
so let's just go for the sake of
argument that 50 the cards

296
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,679
actually work now 298 dollars

297
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,820
much but when we think like are profit
for buying

298
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,010
100 cards with working would be 13,000
834 dollars

299
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,419
here which is yes

300
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,510
wire cards she that isn't excellent
question

301
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,910
they're so cheap because the amount that
are available within the marketplace

302
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,520
it is clear that there is some hearing
based on where the cards come from

303
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,200
so US cards are cheaper than from Europe
and age

304
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,160
so certainly this cost that we're seeing
probably more indicative

305
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,500
US cards otherwise it could be due in
part to

306
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,900
lax security fact that we higher number
credit card

307
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,970
the country's that's out there

308
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,470
is certainly hard to argue against when
you think about

309
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,760
the TJX compromise in so many other mass
compromise

310
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,860
millions of cards go out and on the
market

311
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,860
that's another reason why this cost
might be I was there the question

312
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,850
when you say this 298 dollars how can we
determine

313
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,370
that's pure profit the offender that's a
good question because there is some

314
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,370
times are going spend in terms checking
validating whether

315
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,010
cards corrector work valid they might
have to run it through some sort small

316
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,570
service provider for sale one dollar for
dollar

317
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,659
the so they might try to make purchases
iTunes

318
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,330
mp3 service so this 298 dollars per card
is Justin

319
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,460
estimate this is not by any stretch of
the imagination hard

320
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,260
and fast rule but this is least base so
we might say that the true value that

321
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,340
individual things is

322
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,270
less than this thirteen thousand dollars
but at least starting metric yes

323
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:58,270
and

324
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,889
if we are to look at different resources
we could probably get a variety of

325
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,820
different figures

326
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,200
we go back to the spam estimate for
example we could look at it from the

327
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,860
point of view

328
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,020
actual employer and say if based on the
number expanded individual receives

329
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,650
related

330
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,140
customers and services number ways we
could try to get

331
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,610
metric its part to the complex trying to
understand the overall

332
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,850
process here but your scene to some
degree reasonable

333
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:32,850
others maybe not so much but this is
least certainly yessir the question was

334
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,070
are there certain merchants are certain
processes by which individuals

335
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,770
access to money on these cards more so
right yes there are some

336
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,540
individuals who prefer to just consumer
goods shipped somewhere else

337
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,580
rather than directly textile trade from
an account

338
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,639
certainly money mules other individuals
one

339
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,620
way in which individuals can use cards
simply 100 cards

340
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,210
we could say 50 X Box 360

341
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,340
a buncha Playstations 3 PlayStation 3's

342
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,330
get them resell them upon them 13

343
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:14,580
take and sent to us so there's different
processes that we could use actually get

344
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,189
this money

345
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,100
this is again another one reasons lights
hard so much these numbers

346
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,100
want

347
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,970
sure the question was in terms of drops

348
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,620
how does that actually work individuals
do it so let's say we

349
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,360
army 100 these cards were used 50 them
to actually make purchases

350
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,490
one of the reasons that it's possible to
make those purchases

351
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,910
is because if we are able to obtain the
CV or the three digit number on the back

352
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,150
the card that allows you to make a
purchase physically being present when

353
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,530
that information is provided

354
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,680
much easier to make purchases online so
four drops provider

355
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,810
we could get the card numbers from our
person who buys

356
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,970
the drop with make the purchases
directly

357
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,100
shipped to some location so the fact
that we have multiple individuals

358
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,840
involved

359
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,580
and multiple participants complicates
the process identification

360
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,210
participants rain carter's where

361
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,090
say to individuals by cards and other to
make purchases and other to get the

362
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,060
goods on them

363
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,429
and another to go to Western Union or
some other resource

364
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,730
and have the money sent out of country
to another individual

365
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,740
and say two individuals remain

366
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,350
some part Europe get the money and then
converted into electronic currency

367
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,940
the number of steps involved in some of
the ways in which we can obfuscate the

368
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,610
process

369
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,590
having are good that we purchase sent
somebody's place

370
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,720
Michigan where they don't actually
another person in texas

371
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,950
on these goods resell three-day

372
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,120
further field dispense that part of the
complex

373
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,590
this so it's somewhat heart actually
play

374
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,260
here

375
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,830
in terms

376
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,790
Trojans year the average 742 dollars

377
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,020
a tool let's spend another thirteen
dollars and get a joiner

378
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,360
minor helpless spam twenty people so
what would be the cost

379
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,470
actually a small infrastructure

380
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:30,510
infected boxes based on this data we
would spend 775 dollars in eighty cents

381
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,960
yes infrastructure start when you look
at the dollar losses for

382
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,050
virus or worm infections with workers
43,000 so

383
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,050
pretty significant loss per the relative
spend

384
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,970
actually get start another thing that we
could do we actually get our

385
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,690
infrastructure

386
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,260
given the number people cell week itself

387
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,629
the log files from infections so selling
this kind of junk data around

388
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,740
dollars so per megabyte ten dollars

389
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,860
individuals by this information
hopefully find a little

390
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,150
in there the passwords for different
kinds resources

391
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,960
so that way they can use so it's another
way we might recoup some losses

392
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,480
from our initial investment looking at
it iframe

393
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,710
we're trying to get ourselves started we
spend around six hundred dollars

394
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,850
between buying the most expensive iframe
tool that was on the market at that

395
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,810
point time

396
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,460
plus spending a hundred dollars span to
try to drive in some traffic to our site

397
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,940
let's just say for the sake of argument
we just want to set something up

398
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,050
having to do the infection urself we
spend 48

399
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,080
dollars sense which is the average
third-party

400
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,399
hosted so around six hundred dollars we
can set up an iframe campaign

401
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,310
and then we can least our existing
infrastructure to make back some profit

402
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,110
traffic

403
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,850
if we pay two thousand dollars custom

404
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,030
made looking at some the different
metrics out there

405
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,510
we wanted to wreak the expensive
actually buying them our

406
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,890
we get engage in it attack around five
days

407
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,090
charging the average week at least the
for proxy since that was another thing

408
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,669
that was available through the market

409
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,920
the average being five dollars per lease
we sell $400 leases

410
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,920
we can remake our funds pretty quickly
or we can send out twenty million spam

411
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,580
messages

412
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,280
so there's different ways in which we
can actually generate the funds to

413
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,700
regain what we spent since I minute left

414
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,980
gets you this point is a better owners a
better

415
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,790
thinking about like what's it's the
smart thing to do well

416
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,090
if you want to just do this simply
looking at the marketplace

417
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,200
it's not very easy for a non skilled
entity to engage in relatively

418
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,420
sophisticated forms attack so for the

419
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,450
individual it's much murder least the
profit margin going to be

420
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,600
higher there's less likelihood detection
from

421
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,830
a law enforcement perspective and
there's no me you know spending at that

422
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,949
time making sure that your nose
inspections are

423
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:04,060
or otherwise for the long-term profit
generator the person with skill

424
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,159
there's in setting up your iframe

425
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,730
because you can make money over the long
haul

426
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,760
whether it's three spamming or otherwise
but your risk detection

427
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,190
increase if you're leasing resources
you're probably going to come into

428
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,290
contact with someone

429
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,360
might flip on you say you know you're
running

430
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,100
or otherwise you are going spend time
making sure that your infrastructure

431
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,690
in place is working is fully functional
so it's

432
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,060
nonce minutes depending on what you
truly want to do

433
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,710
overall it's clear that we can make a
lot of money in that we can

434
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,300
resources based on this marketplace the
profit margin is pretty high for the

435
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,230
attacker

436
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,070
and it's generally low cost overall to
engage in this behavior

437
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,370
and looking at it again going back to
when this first lines from a burglary

438
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,830
point of view

439
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,419
the overall value and the cost you
receive

440
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,050
for whatever it is you choose to engage
in whether it's word

441
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,330
singer otherwise is relatively low
compared to the overall

442
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,570
value that attack against resource
somewhat similar to

443
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,040
stealing a TV and then reselling it
you're not getting its overall value

444
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,250
but it's a starting point the most

445
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,270
Herdman think thing to mention sherry

446
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,370
way too much is that the metrics that we
have here

447
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,390
there's more that we can do honored
fully understand

448
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,830
the economic impact these different
types of crimes there's no

449
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,290
freeway to get all this information but
this is least one

450
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,310
initial starting there's a lack of
information out there and so

451
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,399
this is just one potential 10 minutes
for questions

452
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:48,400
yes

453
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,440
so the question is

454
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,580
do we wanna do you more dynamic active
research we're talking

455
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,580
individuals or do we want to take a
passive approach we're just reading

456
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,059
from exploitive you there's a lot of
challenges in terms

457
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,440
he will malware from you because we're
in effect

458
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,360
engaging in some type of criminal
activity ourselves so taking this kind

459
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,059
of passive approach where we read

460
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,690
is preferred from ethical research stand

461
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,830
now there's different partnerships in
different ways we can engage in more

462
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,030
active kinds

463
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,059
study but there are also some challenges
in terms

464
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,820
identification so if for example someone
running

465
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,860
malware site realizes that there's lots
of traffic or suddenly there's some

466
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,520
individual who is from the US

467
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,030
doesn't speak Russian well in our board
that might lead them close the doors and

468
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,990
kinda see all things:

469
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,290
pretty tightly so the less that we
interact this

470
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,409
murder from the point of view
diminishing

471
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:51,880
the knowledge our presence within this
market place if

472
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,220
really well would we do it perspective
given

473
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,870
appropriate authorization the University
humans export

474
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,890
yes we would certainly try but at least
at the moment it's

475
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,330
its easier to pass a research from a
social science free

476
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:13,330
yes

477
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,070
at the so the question is membership
structure

478
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,059
at the time that our data was collected
most these forms a relatively open there

479
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,170
was no initial cost

480
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,640
to setup an account subsequently however
most these forms changed

481
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,660
and hearing in place seeking paid

482
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,010
access different parts the forum one of
them is now closed and requires

483
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,920
multiple forms authentication for the
you so

484
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:51,920
this

485
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,080
authorization refers to from active
participants within the community

486
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,760
money not necessarily any kind of token
or

487
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,780
software-based authentication rather
human

488
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,250
point to point yes this individual knows
you interests you

489
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:19,250
and is willing to stake their reputation
on your accessed

490
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,490
the question is how did seem like
marketplace may have changed

491
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,840
just looking some the same sites on
their open section

492
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,490
a lot of the resources are still the
same them where porsche has dropped off

493
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,130
soul what we see now we're just more
advertisements for spam sir

494
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,240
basic kinds service things from an
organizational standpoint

495
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,400
some of the sites are becoming more
sophisticated and given

496
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,850
different types access it seems like
it's becoming much more structure

497
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,590
at the same time however one of these
very structured group

498
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,750
LiveJournal website LiveJournal profile
where some the

499
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,320
little persistence do you have profiles
within it said

500
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,580
there seems to be sort mixed bag privacy

501
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,129
and public face terms participation
organized crime groups I can't really

502
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,210
say for sure

503
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,850
but it does seem like the form
management structures could be

504
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,200
deemed organizational hierarchy or
structure one or two guys

505
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,750
the top with multiple people working
below that is truly

506
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,160
Russian here I won't speculate but there
to see

507
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:41,160
increasing sophistication yes

508
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,680
yes to the question is in terms of
looking at the broader academic

509
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,190
literature

510
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,630
what's out there from the russian
there's not a lot

511
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,970
see most the research terms Russian

512
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,850
academic research on hacking I'm going
to push for the names but I think it's

513
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,180
Voice schemes is low did some research
looking

514
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,800
Russian perspectives towards sort the
citizenry

515
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,950
think about akers their has not been
much that I'm aware

516
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,090
looking the sort economic issues or

517
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,910
cybercrime perspective for me Russian
criminology point of view

518
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,960
a lot researchers in the US ur are doing
this now

519
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,030
individuals from Carnegie Mellon work
there

520
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,990
researchers out there the US focusing on
this little bit more

521
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,250
at least where are Russian counterpart

522
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,630
questions

523
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:53,630
yes

524
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,799
what's that

525
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,500
shares the questions what's the total
dollar figure that we might ascribe to

526
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,409
these forms in terms of their overall

527
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:09,880
damage to their economic impact based
we're seeing here at least a hundred

528
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,450
thousands if not millions

529
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:18,030
parse this outlook time if we are to
take the metrics from some existing

530
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,030
busts that have taken place like
operation firewall

531
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,678
in 2004 to attend a group called the
shadow for and

532
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,460
the US government is argued that
trafficked 1.4 million credit cards with

533
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,429
so many millions of dollars in damage
caused as a direct result

534
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:37,470
sale and resale stolen information so I
think it's relatively safe are you

535
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,830
there's at least million dollars worth
army here if we take some the economic

536
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,090
figures that have been presented

537
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:49,770
yessir gross profit

538
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,090
hard to say but taking some stated

539
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,380
at face value at least in these economic
represented here probably the same

540
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,210
profits probably pretty least hundreds
thousands if not millions

541
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,650
for certain participants overall we look
at the total for

542
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:11,650
yes are these any kind of insurance or
guarantees for their own transactions

543
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,250
beware the grantor system comes in

544
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,899
escrow payment system where one or two
for members take money on

545
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,759
others that seems to be one of the only
ways in which they sure

546
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,919
actual participation otherwise they
depend on

547
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,589
individual reputations saw your status
as a verified

548
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:35,639
member forms is products untested and we
know that we can trust you

549
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,280
otherwise overtime you seem to be
ripping people off

550
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,310
product writing products you'll be
labeled as a ripper

551
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,730
or cheater and label marketplace

552
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,550
leads being blackballed completely and
and that seems to be the only ways

553
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:59,550
actually insuring participation yessir

554
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,390
so the question is given that we might
try to compare against burglary at least

555
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,589
was framed initially how does it sync
that's something that we are starting to

556
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:22,099
look at

557
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,099
now so I don't have any hard numbers for
you but there is some growing research

558
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,000
to suggest

559
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,089
at least with different types small
firms cybercrime

560
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:34,240
participation in sable for example is
correlated with real-world

561
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,760
bullying behavior as well so there is
some prospective data suggests there's a

562
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,830
relationship between

563
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,990
line behavior but we don't have from
this particular dynamic yet

564
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:48,440
but that's something that people are
beginning to look at economically

565
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,440
no but that is something that we're
going to try to do with the state yes

566
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,250
yes the question is in terms the
corporate get there and

567
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,540
we try to validate by any particular
matter we took the CSI

568
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,770
FBI report dated here and that is
self-reported

569
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,800
in terms of validating that we have not
attempted to do so

570
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,280
but that is something that we might try
over given that the respondents are

571
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,910
anonymous

572
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,020
specified hard

573
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:35,020
yes ma'am you on the back side

574
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:17,569
yes the question is if we try to compare
this method

575
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,459
against other types email campaigns or
otherwise no not yet

576
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:25,788
very good question fact we're serving
the interests this economic analysis

577
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:29,569
and that would be nice to do some
comparisons against say communications

578
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:31,808
or otherwise to see what these things
are like

579
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:35,170
says last question if you have any
further questions for you wanna get hold

580
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,369
me this is my email address

581
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:43,369
feel free to contact me whenever and
thank you for coming

582
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,489
say this is the kind of talk

583
00:37:49,489 --> 00:37:52,579
the reason i cum hope this kind meat and
potatoes overview

584
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:52,930
everything
