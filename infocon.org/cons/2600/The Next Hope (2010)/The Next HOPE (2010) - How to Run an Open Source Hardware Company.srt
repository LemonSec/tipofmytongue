1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,810
speaking of videos okay we're gonna for
Ted you tell me when now

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,120
hold on what we're gonna do is everybody
star laughing really loud when he says

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,660
go

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,610
like I just told a really funny joke
we're rolling now

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,850
well now you blew my whole plan rates

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,750
alright this is not a runner open source
hardware company

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,240
with Lady A to end of the lot around
Obama Make Magazine

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,640
I don't know if you are have picked up a
copy this but it's a fantastic magazine

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,300
I like to call it things I wish I could
be doing it said it going to work

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,399
other some fantastic project in there I
am

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,399
but the let's get these guys are at a
loss

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,340
okay thank you for coming out this early
morning

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,870
that's a good sign challenges businesses

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,239
much time to showing up that sort of
divide so

15
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,280
on filter and creative director a
different industries and I'm also senior

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,989
editor

17
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:05,570
have Make Magazine I'm more I'm a little
of reels and his lady eight and I am the

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,170
owner an engineer at a different
districts where we

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,070
make open source hardware and sell it it
so today I'm

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,500
our talk is going to be about how to run
an open source hardware business and

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,970
we're gonna

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,250
a the phrase like this to come out or
ever we're gonna show you

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,050
Africa start their top to bottom how we
run a company

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,840
was gonna talk a bit about open source
hardware on how many people here do

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,910
electronic sir

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,060
or bill cats full clap and so they can
hear it on the videotape

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,140
yeah high-risk that's good and

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,860
how many have you have I either bought
or

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,190
are whereof open source hardware forget
peres aircraft skin

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,280
it's going to be freezing a so first
what we always like to do is start out

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,520
and talk about what open source hardware
as and the big

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,300
announcement that happen ok forty-eight
hours ago is we have an open source

33
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,959
hardware definitions are just like there
is an open source software

34
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,959
definition that everyone agreed up on
we're getting close to doubt with open

35
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,810
source hardware so the definition is now
at 0.3

36
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,568
and in September there is a Maker Faire
New York City

37
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,420
at the world's fair ground were taken
over at the World's Fair Grounds like

38
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,300
people use to

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,160
in like the thirties when we had video
found to have any fun again sometimes

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,520
they work

41
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,540
a and we're gonna make

42
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,660
that the final Lite 1.0 I announced that
there and then after that you'll see

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,540
licenses and that's one of the things
that I will talk about that

44
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,660
but are we like to talk about open
source hardware

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,329
and kinda three chunks and we're going
to talk about that now

46
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,670
and this is basically what it is arm as
far as a desire to manufactures cancer

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,209
I'm so I was gonna ask

48
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,430
go quickly over like what officers
Hardware is open source hardware we now

49
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,310
control you guys don't open source
software is right you're here at this

50
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,330
hacker conference

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,580
and basically a better hardware

52
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,000
is very similar there are couple legal
differences about your patents verses

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,620
copyrights and the UMass greiz and stuff

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,080
but for the most part it is the same you
want to have a design

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,790
for a project and release in a way that
anyone else was allowed to make it

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,370
without restriction I'm so this is just

57
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,520
I'm to redact ation have the open source
definition it I guess birth parents

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,130
worked on

59
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm email this to make sure we knew I'm
here

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,660
and you know it's it's just a buncha
taxed in you know it's you may wanna

61
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,640
tribution

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,080
and you might want something like share
alike that Creative Commons

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,340
am license definition where you know if
I really something

64
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,740
under I'm a Creative Commons license you
also you can make modifications and keep

65
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,550
them to yourself

66
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,170
I'm and then the only things that are
slightly different because

67
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm open source hardware manufactured I
wanted two things that allow the

68
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,340
companies that make up it was harder
want to make sure others

69
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,830
we put in a clause that I'm make sure
that people didn't you know

70
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,560
the there's a class for trademarks
because they're more important in

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
hardware because it's actually a logo on
it

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,810
and who gets contacted for support I'm
you know I make its and other people

73
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,990
manufacture them I just wanna make sure
that their customers don't come to me

74
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,420
with the assumption that on I
manufacture that and therefore if

75
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,360
there's a problem I have to replace its
a

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,780
also very minor differences really come
up with software so much

77
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,890
am and so

78
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,919
other most time with people talk about
open source however there's only like a

79
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:17,918
few things are involved

80
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,298
its %uh commercially is allowed get sell
it on

81
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,318
attribution just credit me and then

82
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,090
I share like to make changes put it out
there and I've been

83
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,199
I guess assigned take catalog with open
source hardware that over the last

84
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,699
five years six years now it's been a
long time on so if I

85
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,020
2005 you're gonna far to the Chargers
only a few projects and

86
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,169
more had like both of them and had her
as

87
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,669
a tier one by more and more people
started doing open source hardware so

88
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,750
were up to Lake maybe 300 projects

89
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm a lot of them are Ardrey no
derivative so that's kinda

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,460
been a big chunk of it the last year so
but you can see it's its

91
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,530
it's going pretty well and why the
questions we always get asked this

92
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,220
whites could do it conference will

93
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,880
who's actually doing open source
hardware the types that companies where

94
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,370
they actually making kits on whether
they're kinda test if something's a good

95
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,560
I guess I call you know no one's ever
gonna make a million dollars

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,639
are well I emailed or the company said
you open source hardware turns out most

97
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,580
ever over raking over a million dollars

98
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,080
your revenue and a few other American
over ten million dollars in revenue

99
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,580
and some oven most of them were in the
middle on if you see that's that's it

100
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,719
that's a chunky metal

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,919
and real quick here some other companies
on effort industries

102
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,190
on that's the worst company and the
company I I spent so much time

103
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,850
out working with and the we do
educational electronics

104
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,600
and on wheels have weird stuff like
culture jamming projects up stuff that

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,410
we don't sell

106
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,520
like this cell phone jammer I that you
can build

107
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,909
to search for cell phone jammer cat or
surf a cell phone jammer

108
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,160
but wat bubble ongoing you'll see the
tutorial them or make

109
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,949
we need a flashlight that so bright it
makes you vomit it's fun it was a

110
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,540
yeah on Homeland Security paid a couple
million 41 and I we made one for about

111
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,250
10 to 15

112
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,080
yourself I will get it out and our
documentation section

113
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,859
out there were over the million dollar
mark now %uh hardly know how many re

114
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,510
you're familiar with there being a
project will clap ask

115
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,340
pray so if you're all school year in a
row like Basic Stamp in like doing

116
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,690
things with microcontrollers kinda hard
at work on all systems now

117
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,400
Arduino was kinda grew out of the
processing world on which is a open

118
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,699
source way to do visualization and
graphics

119
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:26,160
are really took off is over a hundred
fifty thousand out there

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,570
and they're well over million dollars in
revenue factor probably

121
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,610
closer like the 52 attends out and a

122
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,000
everything that you see on an Arduino
you can make yourself you can

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,270
manufacture yourself

124
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,260
on mucus in the boards out but we think
it is called Arduino could have the

125
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,789
trademark this only thing they ask

126
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,870
that you you don't do on the also prefer
if you make the porch blue

127
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,970
but its just that request our beagle
board this is

128
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,210
I effort from Texas Instruments I

129
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,280
and Dickey they teamed up and they did a
an open source port

130
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,910
and they want people to use his own apt
chip kinda cool project

131
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,360
are different than the Arduino if you're
interested in making like a portable

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,830
laptop or kiosk this is the support for
you

133
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,039
and over a million dollars revenue some
you probably already have this book

134
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,410
clubs are based out of here

135
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,350
in New York are they make Lego computers
senseless best way to describe it

136
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,240
you let's see if you want to make a GPS
a camera

137
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,919
wifi connected saying on UK plug in
these modules at all then expect you

138
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,000
is is that clips and there you go

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,350
rapid prototyping on their perching
million this year

140
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,790
jumpy a there these little can be a
device is that you can put

141
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,460
any words will screen and it connects
online

142
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,590
and it downloads a bunch of stuff that
you set up in advance is kinda like

143
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,690
physical version of widgets on computers

144
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,009
and there BC funded some officers are a
company's

145
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,360
don't are just crappy like units
starting this in their basement so their

146
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,169
permits

147
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,770
I like we have are they actually went
out got venture capital

148
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,099
and that's an interesting thing cuz
venture capital they want to

149
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,669
buy something that they sell so what
does that mean for officers are going to

150
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:02,630
talk about that

151
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,750
that but I chubby does simple licensing
else ever tell me

152
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,040
patton and the buddy who's kind of a
well-known actor if you're into the

153
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
hardware hacking scene

154
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,860
is working on a chubby hack reports so
it's kinda like

155
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,130
I an Arduino plus the BeagleBoard but
its a

156
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,340
but it its it's really powerful and will
have that

157
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,360
selling its a really neat kinda portable
Linux computer

158
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,780
for like 100 bucks yeah in Albany

159
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,860
Rd just prototypes there in a new entry

160
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,529
I in the the maker up this

161
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,570
was a writer actor day and then decided
to do

162
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,360
a bus fire basically it's like a reverse
engineering two of you wanted to

163
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,040
figure out what's going on over US beer
can attack something and a

164
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,769
you know or it digital microscope year
the sick that's a that's a good analogy

165
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,839
a already almost a million dollars and

166
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,620
2010 DIY drones on these are microsites

167
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,839
a civil UAVs so if you want to make your
own drone the flies around to take

168
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,480
photos

169
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,089
this is a project rip and where the cool
things is the editor in chief

170
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,220
wire are Chris Anderson this is his
project and he runs around the world in

171
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,420
first let's talk about wire but this is
it seems to me this is what is passion

172
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,819
is in the start gate dad

173
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,629
and already this is a hobby that turned
into are really big enterprise

174
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:20,170
on you know Jones or find a one of the
first things that happen is he

175
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,069
accidentally flew into Los Alamos

176
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:26,719
and like you know shit you know what
freighter attack but it was easy I dirty

177
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,699
for wired so like if it was one of us a
private different story

178
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,889
but he's like no no it's only okay like
just you know do an open source hardware

179
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:33,970
really

180
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,980
a evil mad scientist laboratories they
do

181
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,499
really cool clocks really interesting
LED panels again

182
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:43,990
just a couple that does this add to
their house for two million dollars

183
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,970
bigger body just raise a lot of a folks
you're probably familiar that their

184
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,110
doing low-cost 3d printers under

185
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,929
hundred thousand dollars and they have a
cool website called thing covers the

186
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,009
people upload all these files to

187
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,540
are already over a million dollars and
revenue our Maker Shed

188
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,290
for Make Magazine I get you have a

189
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,029
a cool thing like make thats a brand
it's a it's the

190
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,730
magazine that you for rather be reading
that are building

191
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,350
then doing work stuff but are they also
they also have a store and there's also

192
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,569
store Maker Shed

193
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:20,179
just got the gift shop at the end up a
relax after this if the doing Electronix

194
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:20,879
for a long time

195
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,829
they've embraced open source hardware
and we've been working with them for

196
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:24,619
that too

197
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:27,709
I label it open source hardware actually
kinda get the credit they deserve

198
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,939
they've always published a lot of stuff
being called open source hardware

199
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:34,319
and other working on that now sixty
years these guys are based out of China

200
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,219
which is kinda need for them because
they're

201
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,670
on there closer to the supply chain we
can talk about cloning and

202
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,399
and kinda like you think that sells it
up it's ours are

203
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,970
so is it people say well with your stuff
gets going to China will

204
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,439
already happens from Caesarea develops
our stuff they do

205
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,459
open source hardware Rd over a million
dollars revenue

206
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,869
solar robotics they do little robotic
kits for kids mostly but they also the

207
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:58,379
officers are Verde totally

208
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,670
derivatives and smartphone electronics
are kinda leading

209
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,790
the the pack right now with revenue over
10 million dollars in revenue

210
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,759
a base or Boulder Colorado a lot of you
do electronics probably get this red

211
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,290
boxes

212
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,309
male from there and so that's just a few
companies in this just you know once

213
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,420
you're in the beginning I talked to show

214
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,719
some idea of what's going on so that's
about fifty million dollars with

215
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,660
companies right

216
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,319
right there on this is with about 200
projects altogether

217
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:27,368
and mister the company's I said before
already approaching $2.5 million dollar

218
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,170
mark

219
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,259
and so that's an overview of how all
these

220
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,660
what all these folks do and then what we
wanted to do is kinda diggin

221
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,639
on what's right here is how we actually
run an open source hardware business

222
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,220
and we'll I bounce back and forth
between the two of us

223
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,050
were built on open source software so
whatever questions you as good as well

224
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,029
what it would be running

225
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:51,230
and I'll more than 18 develop this so
what it teaches

226
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,300
up north source sweet stuff like just
you know

227
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,920
a commercial package it can't lie I feel
like I grew up like hacking 1x

228
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,998
sexy something I was pretty comfortable
with and I'm you're getting a server

229
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:04,589
and running I myself was really
inexpensive way to start because you can

230
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:05,489
get

231
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:09,339
you know virtual host for like you know
twenty bucks a month

232
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,899
I'm and then their web card itself I
mean I started

233
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,309
with just pay pal buttons and like a
simple HTML page but then eventually

234
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,170
it's more complicated you need shipping
abroad and you need reports and you need

235
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,729
invoices and people want to buy more
than one thing at once and sales tax in

236
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,679
he's a complicated when the really nice
things about have eagle and system

237
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,929
especially with something like

238
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,149
OS commerce which is the Clark shopping
cart is

239
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,100
I'm a lot like the really annoying
bullshit a shopping cart and taken care

240
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,239
of for you

241
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,829
see I can go with him I got heavily
modified the card because it's

242
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:46,429
its PHP and MySQL so I'm ily for example
we added am

243
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:49,769
like a carrot mod so if people order
more than a hundred dollars with the

244
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,949
staff here they get a free bad year

245
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:55,639
some stickers or something something
extra and

246
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,749
most you know commercial cards that you
would purchase

247
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:03,389
like online or or read online I'm you
know if they don't have a lot you're

248
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,449
never gonna get it so you can't

249
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,629
do all that you know that creative stuff
that you may want to do with

250
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:12,699
I'm shopping cart and be able different
yourself from others is really important

251
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,519
so that's why I suggest open source
software

252
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,489
yeah and will show some examples from
the bonds that we did in and hopefully

253
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:22,249
on for almost a decade not ever finish

254
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:26,389
a a a shopping cart always adding things
but I will be releasing our own mods

255
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,470
attacks to visit our community

256
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,980
on and yes with the other question we
get quote what hosting provider do you

257
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,549
get your site is on such that sometimes
you never go down

258
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,029
and we as a servant and we were on the
eighty dollar plan

259
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,189
for the longest time and we just moved
to its really moved up to dedicated yes

260
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:42,498
it was

261
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:45,369
is actually getting outta control but
for really long time a sexy and the

262
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:47,889
least expensive its like fifty dollars

263
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm you can get it cheaper from like 11
but

264
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,699
what I really like about servant I mean
what every there's other really good

265
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:55,679
ones but

266
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,699
I moved from any hosting providers in
like they actually like tell you before

267
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,470
they go down for like two days

268
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,040
and like you know they actually do
backups in like as actually ask them to

269
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,719
get you know like I overrode my HD
access found in like I'm gonna rain is

270
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,170
moderate again I have to get that file
back

271
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,730
and the xy got back from me and that's
that's really impressive in like

272
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,749
be able to undo Lee like 1 files that
saves you

273
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:22,379
a couple hours that's worth a hundred
box have your time because it's

274
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:27,069
it's a hassle and if if they go down you
know you lose those day sale so

275
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:30,230
even though it a lot of people if they
wanna go inside our hosting I think it's

276
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,989
it's the one thing that you're going to
spend money on

277
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:36,689
get a good hosting provider either
serving or some other place that you

278
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:37,759
know

279
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,779
what screw you over and then like nine
to your phone calls

280
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,449
yeah I mean if you're living I'll if you
make your living from an online store

281
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:44,809
its

282
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,618
it is the most important thing you know
in our studio we have to internet

283
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:48,879
connections because

284
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,589
like we figured out like when our
internet connection is down we're kinda

285
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:52,649
screwed going to get a third

286
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,019
its during holidays and when its
mission-critical we really need

287
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:01,029
to do stuff so from pushing for higher
2009 even in our own

288
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:05,160
order our studio so shopping carts offer
as aforesaid we Zen Cart

289
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,420
and it just for como es gas and there's
a couple forks OS commerce you can

290
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,279
choose

291
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,439
which one you want there's like three or
four I like Zen Cart

292
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,459
but a lot people use OS commerce yeah

293
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,929
the pre I mean not easy to modify but if
you had any experience with again like

294
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:21,749
my scrilla

295
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,790
for PHP it's not too bad yeah

296
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,839
and this is just a behind-the-scenes
look on and will have all the slides

297
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,609
online

298
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:32,259
we also have a an article that we read
about this is what it looks like behind

299
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:33,629
the scenes orders come in

300
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,759
I a customer places it says processing

301
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,799
are we have pending orders for poor
people who'd a

302
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,040
is a purchase order or if they send a
check or money order that just wait

303
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,389
until we approve it

304
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,759
and I'm from there we've done some cool
mods what are the things that we did

305
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,059
recently was

306
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,769
out when are on stuff comes in take a
press one button it prints all orders at

307
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,220
our necks but I did and we have another
but the prints all

308
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,829
expedited orders when someone or
something overnight no matter what you

309
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:02,009
say if you say well you know we don't
ship every day we ship

310
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,439
it takes two to three days whatever
doesn't matter someone order something

311
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,069
overnight

312
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:08,249
they actually think you're going to stop
everything and said it overnight so

313
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:11,859
we do that we product we prioritize the
orders that have

314
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:15,209
expedited shipping and that's solve a
lot of customers for this year's

315
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,429
because people will call us at three in
the morning and say

316
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:21,608
you know I ordered a agree now and I
really needed it by today

317
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:24,799
like where is it and it is sometimes
they say it's life or death I'm not

318
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,108
quite sure they're going with an Arduino
but

319
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:30,249
job they say no your sales like that

320
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:33,299
on and so because he is in car because
he is

321
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:37,480
lampen because we have others data we
developed an inventory system the

322
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,279
predictive inventory system

323
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,919
maybe talk over yes so I wanna things
that your

324
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,749
it it doesn't really come up to is
really important is like supply chain

325
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:49,600
engineering which is basically how long
might make so much money

326
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,669
is that you have to have just enough
stuff that you'll be able to sell it but

327
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,970
not so much you're sitting on piles of
inventory

328
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,429
and the balance between the two is
really really hard

329
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:02,009
am so what are things that I did to help
me and you can keep it on your head

330
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,279
sometimes but

331
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,699
I'm you know if you again if you have an
open source cart where you can touch the

332
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:07,600
database

333
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,270
and grabbed a doubt it's very easy to
say well how many have like

334
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,139
X today sell the last two weeks enjoy
have that many last if I don't know it

335
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,600
takes me two weeks to get

336
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,569
send me an email down warned me and this
is actually something that

337
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,079
you know you know NBA's you know
contract out for a hundred thousand

338
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,020
dollars make

339
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,809
it's really simple to do if you know
even the most basic database programming

340
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:32,370
just like a report %uh system and you
can see you know when

341
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,150
the red marks mean you are not going to
make it today in the next week or two

342
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,950
weeks so be sure to

343
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,600
you don't get that stuff in stock as
quickly as possible and also United's

344
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,340
look down and see like am i ok if the
next two weeks other any red marks

345
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,080
or what I want to order something I want
to keep say one quarters with inventory

346
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,929
in stock

347
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,280
I look on the very right hand side and
there's a number it says OK you know you

348
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,180
need to get

349
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,770
thousand read more wires ki sent you to
sell a house in bundles

350
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,040
after quarter it makes purchasing much
easier that's another thing that's gonna

351
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,950
take up more and more time is

352
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,250
just keeping track of inventory and
purchasing went again one

353
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,740
psychologically we kinda view this is a
video game we don't have a TV or play

354
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,820
video games or play fuck farmville or
whatever but

355
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,280
it's kinda like that where were likely a
ok rap you know we need to plant more

356
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,490
these things good reason to come up as
if to feed the sheep

357
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,170
you know it's it is it is a lot like
that maybe that's why we think it's fun

358
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,890
because we're kinda playing this game
and and instead getting points

359
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,650
you txt get real money that's fine on

360
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,060
the other thing data yes the other thing
that

361
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,690
on the more work Don was the park
selectors so we get asked all the time

362
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,520
where you get your stuff

363
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,600
where do you get your shipping supplies
where do you get everything so instead

364
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,650
of answering every body which net wiki

365
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,740
I was gonna look at defense mechanism
it's like tough-talking years with the

366
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,500
and we put all this stuff up there and
so that's another thing what's

367
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,710
the inventory system says shape any
switches Vasquez

368
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,360
too many people ordered the looking
wheels on we can go into our own part

369
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,850
selector that we is as a resource and we
also released a for everybody else it's

370
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,590
actually not very

371
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,270
it's so obvious that it and year to me
for ever get done but once I did it say

372
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,970
be so much time exactly just a list

373
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,210
I love every component I get all that
parts

374
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,630
that you know make up the kids I'm and
then a link to

375
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,840
unit the precise page where to buy it
and then

376
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,639
I'm if I have multiple suppliers that
something that's really important to

377
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,440
have at least

378
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,450
two or three suppliers for every item
you need because

379
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,610
I'm one will go on vacation or like you
know going to business or something you

380
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,850
down a backup

381
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,150
and where they'll be at a stopping to
take 4-6 weeks and so you know I can

382
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,070
quickly go through all my suppliers or
even you know

383
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,429
have an employee doing say like okay we
need to get you know I'm

384
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,260
like packing materials get like 500
boxes and then they just click the link

385
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:42,620
in

386
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,360
in order it is it all these little
things which seem like

387
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,890
really small details the act together
and

388
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,520
allow you to get so much more done and
again it's like all the stuff is like if

389
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,560
you can edit the wiki if you can edit

390
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,760
a spreadsheet an incentive to be on the
piece is a paper structured ask

391
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,570
which is what a lot of purchasing
managers do am it'll really help you and

392
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,419
also you know

393
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,470
this is also a public resource other
people use this for when they want to

394
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,980
find it was the cheapest place to get a
microcontroller

395
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,460
I did the research for them and they can
just put on that link yeah does it is

396
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,240
our competitors is this but like
whatever

397
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,350
like you know they're gonna they're
gonna buy something from us anyways and

398
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,880
then

399
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,180
figure out where we got it from and do
this so like you know when we say them

400
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,840
sometime

401
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,080
they can to be with us on other things
on next up

402
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,159
this is what whatever invoices look like
%uh when

403
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,440
the customer places an order because it
is an car we signed a bar code to it

404
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,610
will say you are actually

405
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,620
off the shelf stuff that we've out of
the bay and

406
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,970
what are the things that we did that
little green box over time we think it's

407
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,630
now read gets RS

408
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,170
what I think that we figured out is
there are certain things that your hands

409
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,990
are really good at certain things that
computers are good at so what we do is

410
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,790
you look at the address we look at how
it matches up we look there's certain

411
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,960
countries are certain things

412
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,170
we must have like a no fly list armed
with some filters

413
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,400
and it's basically 0 a shipping for
simply stop

414
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,960
and take a look at this if someone's
ordering something overnight

415
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,310
and their billing addresses & you
Pakistan but they wanted to go to LA to

416
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,340
hotel

417
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,280
um and it's like a thousand dollars
worth of our trainers we should probably

418
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,120
ask some questions it turns out every
single time

419
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,180
it's been true was interesting because I
am fraud prevention week record for

420
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,490
prevention computer really really bad at
it

421
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,400
so if anyone out there want to start a
company make a lot of money this is

422
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,210
actually a really good idea because

423
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,310
credit card like authorize another
credit card companies have eight fraud

424
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,710
detection

425
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,610
sweet and its crack it the worst thing
ever it doesn't do a good job on the

426
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,620
paper house

427
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,750
isn't that great the humans are really
good at it

428
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,740
I'm and I don't could really know why
but like we can quickly look at

429
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,750
addresses and say like

430
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,790
0 this person is a shipping it to their
work address I can tell because like

431
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,010
it wit you know it's close its the zip
code is really close

432
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm and you know obviously this is a
business address it's like you know

433
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,990
circle drive or something

434
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,920
her for you know how people use names
like foobar like come on like

435
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,550
my credit card this guy like mine true
harder so that the celebrity names a mic

436
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,120
now you're not Brad Pitt but that's not
what are Guinness

437
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,860
so I like I like Hotmail address I get a
little think that this little things

438
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,500
that look kinda email address

439
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,120
if it's name at gmail dot com it's
actually less likely be fraud in like

440
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,400
you know spurt c49 sparkle at like
Hotmail doctor outfit that like sets off

441
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,670
alarms for people

442
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,770
but computers don't know that Hotmail
address is less

443
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,370
I'm rival the University address not
everybody is Pay Pal is a credit card

444
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:28,920
debt but

445
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,130
every credit card if it had his a part
now

446
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,130
on it here's a I'll go back one more
here's

447
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,420
another kinda fun and schedules security
fix

448
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,670
upset someone was using our shopping
cart to test if credit cards

449
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,340
were stolen so what they would do is buy
these I

450
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,020
list have credit cards entered into our
cart with fake names just to see if they

451
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,389
can get the authorization

452
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,270
what you would say like sorry your dress
doesn't match in our court would pass it

453
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,900
through

454
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,130
but then once in a while we get people
calling up and say I saw charge

455
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,950
from a different that came in in one way
what happened and Mike okay so what we

456
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,330
did is we actually set up our shopping
cart if people

457
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,129
attempt to use credit cards for the same
IP address more than a couple times

458
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,410
it text messages my phone I go online
and then

459
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,040
I have a automatic script that goes to
see where their IP addresses from

460
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,470
and most of the time it's like little
villages in China or India and we ban

461
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,070
that so it took just one week

462
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,120
and we just started the band I've never
heard a single shopping cart that has a

463
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,940
built-in

464
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,130
yeah even though it's like such an
obvious thing you want defend against

465
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,510
so if you have a commercial card you
know you get you still have to pay

466
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,390
I see every time somebody declined the
card key stock to pay that decline see

467
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,110
I'm take twenty cents but like if you're
doing a hundred cars can add up

468
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,200
but you know took us like half an hour
you know a simple little like check how

469
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,640
many

470
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,350
you know failures has has this person
had in sending email via PHP

471
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,240
we just annoyed when someone is our our
cart for that you know could use someone

472
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,310
else's he doesn't care about stuff

473
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,540
Amazon are event the other thing that we
did

474
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,960
was I am because we have a a shopping
cart system that we can completely

475
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,700
modified

476
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,000
where things start to take up all over
time was resellers if you're selling

477
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,860
electronics

478
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,470
I mean you're doing a good job other
people want to sell the stuff for you

479
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,250
and that's really getting we'll talk
about margins in just a few minutes

480
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,320
but I'll we decided well you know
there's resellers and people are

481
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,060
businesses

482
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,830
there's also a lot hackerspace is in
fact later on today there's a great talk

483
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,260
from

484
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,870
I think match it some other people talk
about hackerspace is we saw you don't

485
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,590
make actor spaces resellers

486
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,750
so what we did is we made a special a
flag

487
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,940
on an account and one when someone says
they're hackerspace and tell us that

488
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,100
they have like 50 people

489
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,170
they want to sell kits we make them a
reseller and when they log in

490
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,230
on the get a different than receipts is
wholesale club the top

491
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,110
if you look at the bottom it says ok
your prices now as low as fifty one

492
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,880
dollars a setup eighty five dollars

493
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,610
sasser shopping they can actually see
the discounts that they're gonna get

494
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,690
it's the same shopping cart is this a
different level I have

495
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,300
discounts apply it's a silly people
faxing stuff are

496
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,270
on the education side or companies
having their fax after purchasing

497
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,629
lady named Apple in she could just go
and put it into the shopping cart

498
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,510
and in a check out and it saves us
probably two or three staff positions

499
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,040
just have a shopping cart they can do
resellers

500
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,520
on some other part systems online that
use OS commerce is anchored I'm

501
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,360
smartphone

502
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,550
they've really treat there's out on
these OS commerce

503
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,280
a seat studio wanted other companies I
mentioned before are the years or as

504
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,970
commerce

505
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,070
I don't say that there are delays in car
and a

506
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,149
that kinda move this along to payments
while are taking

507
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,320
money is probably the most part thanks
so for core processor you we is

508
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,230
authorized on

509
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,780
that and what are the things that on
destroy some security except how many

510
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,940
here for to PCI compliance

511
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,170
now wow you guys are loud okay we r

512
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,560
at a credit card okay give it to him you
know

513
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,020
so the second was the if you store
credit cards

514
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,970
few have the customer data on you have
to follow all these things

515
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,780
so what we do is we do an authorization
and authorizes owned by

516
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,800
the soul it's about yeah I'm sure just
got your sister something they come up

517
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,980
with the PCI compliant standards force

518
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,470
and they're all connected and we do is
really is authorized authorize the

519
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,260
charges

520
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,720
and we'll store any credit cards now
there's a few things know what kinda

521
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,490
hackers

522
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,920
just for this credit card information is
hasn't happened to us is always

523
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,500
a a method of attack but week don't have
credit cards on our servers anywhere

524
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,560
as we don't have to worry about this as
much as authorizes problem

525
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,770
Thursday doing authorization they tell
us how much money we can charge you can

526
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,170
charge

527
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,960
over that amount this pretty much we
decide to do it's worked out so far

528
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,760
yeah I mean like that you know there's a
couple downsides like you know you you

529
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,310
can head back orders meant ship the back
or later and my kids a one-click

530
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,940
K you know i dnt one click and you know
be it people to enter the credit card

531
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,900
data every time

532
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,240
but we found that you know frito keep
customers complain about there was a

533
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,050
look

534
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm its you know for your safety we
don't even want it touch the state and

535
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,120
have it

536
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,680
in our database because we don't want
that risks you know we think that we

537
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,880
secured our

538
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,110
server pretty well but you light why
have the stuff hanging around my have

539
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,540
this

540
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,320
true taking and so far we've had almost
you know palms and it's not like I don't

541
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,360
think that our sales have

542
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,960
her and also if you're setting up the
store I strongly

543
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,660
I encourage people not to store credit
card data even though it's tempting in

544
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,430
the you know

545
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,280
for to charge rectification wherever am
it's not worth it

546
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,230
even if you would make a lil bit more
money because the extra hassles time

547
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,590
love a PCI compliance now I'm required
to everyone

548
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,220
yeah and justice for a kind of on a side
note we never allow people to pay us

549
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,920
money

550
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,810
if we're not able to ship something I
immediately for the most part real

551
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,639
we learn this lesson a few times if
someone or something

552
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,720
and we don't have in stock even if it
takes a few days I'm we decided

553
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,020
not allow that recently on for some
items they will but mostly want because

554
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,550
once you

555
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,110
have someone's money the first thing is
like I paid you need a semi my thing

556
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,810
and so we've decided that we're not
going to do that and let's solve all our

557
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,159
customer support issues

558
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,650
I'm if there's products that we have
that are really popular some people like

559
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,400
what can i just pay now he said whenever

560
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,010
tempting now we don't do that no one
massive is that day's do not

561
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,540
take people's money unless you have
something to shift within like

562
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,300
Chu days even credit card companies will
punish you if you don't

563
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,980
capped reauthorization within like one
or two days if the Palomar

564
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,120
and even extended essay 0 6-2 4-6 weeks
any that might help me find

565
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,960
say you manufacture just don't do it
because I've actually never seen anyone

566
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,540
who didn't say afterwards a complete
regret doing that

567
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,149
I was greedy and they want the money
quickly yeah but I spend all my time

568
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,309
dealing with pissed off customers

569
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:29,410
at some people are like oh all the six
five dollars is to prove that they want

570
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:29,940
it

571
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,970
nightmare on 60 we'll stick it out

572
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,230
and that's how a more started with a
diff richter's is the buy button on a

573
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,760
page

574
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,820
people makes it really easy
international customers are making these

575
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,020
ppl lot easier

576
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,389
what I want to bank transfers and that's
always it there's fees and everything

577
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,059
I'm we suggest when you start out if you
just have a web page at the button

578
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,399
pay pal is the way to go in a pro tip on
when you get people can't get what are

579
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,780
these

580
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,309
they have a little e8 card and they have
little dangle you have to

581
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,850
putting your password and then your
stuff you just don't know it just it's

582
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,490
another layer security

583
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,530
I its probably harder to to to crack all
this

584
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,639
then just getting someone's Pay Pal
password when we see

585
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,200
I'm theft and fraud from Pay Pal is
usually when a customer

586
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,700
they get their passwords stolen I mean
to customers said Oh I will I live in

587
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,920
this apartment building

588
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,450
and someone will got on my wife I
figured out my login password

589
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,690
and that this happened but times I where
do you live like take kick

590
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,750
you know really like everyone around you
is they're doing is constantly like

591
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,320
maybe

592
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,439
figure out another replace live but that
was our biggest problem is

593
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,980
someone kept someone kept getting there
Pay Pal password and buying stuff

594
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,070
and they have it shipped to the same
place cuz they all live in the same

595
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,600
place and we do you ever run into
someone with your package

596
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,770
now US to get one of those I think it's
like a couple bucks

597
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,940
I'm and then I miss forrest

598
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,620
kinda just falls in the marking 702
marketing

599
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,940
but we did decide to try to make the
best electronics

600
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,210
blog ever you want to call it now online
and in order to do that we wanted to

601
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,030
have a really good

602
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,930
system and so we invented word press
directly inside our site

603
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,340
and that worked out really well so
anytime you're looking at Koolatron

604
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,240
projects

605
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,210
online for months even if it's not
something we sell your surround your

606
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,120
that the

607
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,480
the chrome at the store and you're able
to see on products that we sell

608
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,640
and we've seen sales increase because
this we also did this with our form so

609
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,990
everything is inside

610
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,710
the story we like that a lot more press
on it's all tricky

611
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,840
but it was but we have to keep it
updated and stop their credit cards and

612
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,320
yeah and we do things like customer
centers

613
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,590
on emails on hey I got I order something
today

614
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,400
UK shifted I am in 20 minutes and his
two thousand miles away and i got

615
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,850
married we don't i save my grandfather's
life cases are we know it

616
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,230
is for his pacemaker something like that
and the

617
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,390
so we put this up on line you know we
have customer feedback that goes

618
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,780
directly on our blog

619
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,910
I what are the things that were a we
suggest that if you're going to have a

620
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,570
content destination if your gonna do
documentation if you're gonna have

621
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,250
something

622
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,010
for people to return to every day I'm
measure it I mean we

623
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:05,059
didn't really set out to have I any
specific goals with traffic but

624
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:08,410
I starting the a two-fer flawed it

625
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,530
already went up to a million pages and a
month and that does a great sales

626
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,990
I'm same thing with make on 02

627
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,660
five or six million pages in less than a
year when we started a few years back

628
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,059
and on the not measuring something
there's really no way to improve

629
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,340
I think so other three tools you can use
any other family is

630
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,809
Google Analytics whatever a there's
probably other ones are the company's

631
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:35,330
to make the graphs and they can tell you
where people are coming from

632
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,990
%uh everything we do is we have forum so
if you have a product

633
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,050
and you need to support it you can do it
over email

634
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,629
but all that knowledge is lost its going
from email to email maybe

635
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,490
if there on Gmail gmail make some money
because of a bad around it but

636
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,690
that knowledge that you're transferring
to the person is is gone so

637
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,280
on although it would be nice to answer
every email individually what we do is

638
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,730
we have the customers

639
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,340
post up in the forums and recently we
added a mod

640
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,150
that when you start an account on a
different order something you

641
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,900
automatically have an account

642
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,330
in the a different forms and that's
worked out really well and we do have

643
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,490
moderation we hired someone to go

644
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,250
make sure that there's no spam first of
and we did a monster PHP

645
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,260
PB which kind anyway able skull just for
the administrators

646
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,720
so when someone does spammer do
something wrong it's going to press it

647
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
it bans or username their IP address the
email address

648
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,140
and then it says I just write them so
weekend we try to make my rating

649
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,080
fun for our moderators because it is me
to get a spammer and is kinda fun that

650
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,689
you know that they're never gonna visit
the site

651
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,960
which have all these collateral damage
will get someone from Indonesia or

652
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,170
something like that like i cant

653
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,750
a campus on the ford says I'm a spammer
it's like okay well on last week

654
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,050
your IP address someone wasn't like oh
yeah ups you know

655
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,840
so date you know they're going at my
company does that was our

656
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,840
so a but I want help with Meyer a

657
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,240
so phpBB is what we is as other open
source

658
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,340
form suffer but that's the one we like
the most right now

659
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,780
a documentation gonna spend a lot of
time on this cuz we think this is the

660
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,670
most important thing

661
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,080
this kind of our advertisers we think if
you put out good information that is

662
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,500
your advertising on we have we think
some of the best tutorials online maybe

663
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,190
about

664
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,690
100 over 100 over 100 right now and

665
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:23,350
there's no ads on them there's I you
don't need to buy the electronics from

666
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,530
us this early

667
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,649
and we show you we teach people we think
it is people though

668
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,850
the reward you so if your tutorial
section you can see them but that's what

669
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,530
we spend a lot of time on it thank you
spend more time on documentation

670
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,440
design electronic edit engineering takes
a couple days the documentation takes

671
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,160
weeks then what you doing addition you
realize we mistakenly at this one

672
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,429
sharing and then yeah

673
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,540
the cycle and what are the other things
it is what we think it or list

674
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,850
done finish complete we put in other
places like Instructables because they

675
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,309
have some massive amount of people that
are looking

676
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:57,040
at their their pages and so we'll just
basically

677
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,090
copy and paste the documentation
directly Instructables miss another

678
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,660
great thing you can do. few

679
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,010
documentation once again go different
places you can turn into an article

680
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,639
it turn into if it's a helpful how-to
such as like span the entire

681
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,669
the product on you can actually do more
with that so

682
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:14,549
I don't know if it's because you get
it's not laziness is just like I do

683
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,530
something once I wanna

684
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,760
be able to do it multiple places
speaking of

685
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,190
if you get a digital camera one other
things to look into is a wireless card

686
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,899
for it so we take a photo in our studio

687
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:28,779
a product for documentation it uploads
to Flickr

688
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,530
it tweaks to overtake Twitter followers
it goes on to our blog now

689
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,000
and it goes into our documentation
system so that's one click

690
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,179
1 photo a and it out that's

691
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,629
I can ever it a fun thing we get
customer feedback immediately

692
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:48,649
are kinda over keep the read it right
we'll keep something secret anymore

693
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:50,578
forgot something we put photos out there

694
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:54,730
the bills the man people like it and
still working out

695
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,799
a the IFI manager is something that you
can configure

696
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:02,390
to go just about anywhere putting your
site doesn't have to be forever

697
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,618
and it goes to our first thing like I
said we all suffer Flickr photo group

698
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:10,150
that customers put their stuff and

699
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,450
and so do build something and then
they'll put in the Flickr photo for the

700
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,379
show other people

701
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,630
and then kinda making begets making and
have

702
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,609
already we have a few thousand people
they're putting all their projects and

703
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:22,930
with the kids we have in the sharing
that with all their friends

704
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,169
there this is kind of like that
information is is advertising for us

705
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,089
are and every time we do something we
try to make sure it goes everywhere so

706
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,160
are we really like Facebook or Twitter
that much but they're kinda useful first

707
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,190
some folks

708
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,430
XO we make sure that we put a blog post
online

709
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,690
because to our Facebook group page a
ghost writer Erica all the different

710
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,329
places

711
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:45,450
on but we only do it once you actually
spend our time on this earth tons have

712
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,689
free web services that people that
venture capital for that'll eventually

713
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,349
die

714
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:53,180
that we should totally take advantage of
on uploading videos is subsidized by all

715
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,828
these companies want your concert

716
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:57,910
on minutes for the cut it's a great but
they can host your

717
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,359
awesome HD product videos they just to
dying for that stuff

718
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,799
%uh scissors soccer oh yeah

719
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:09,109
%uh it speaking of a go back one a

720
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:13,940
0 also the video just for commerce site
I

721
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,380
we'll set a product that went on Twitter
so we had this

722
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,690
kilowatt device that keeps track of how
much power you said you have in your

723
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,190
home

724
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,710
we decided to turn it into a tweeting
power meter

725
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,039
and so we a dinner in design competition
we won and we supposed to be a pretty

726
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,769
okay

727
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:33,499
so every time um is every 24 hours or so

728
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:37,660
are art Twitter followers I've this
tweet white

729
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,739
know how much power we used and people
who want to do

730
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:43,829
power grid analysis on Google announced
the product that

731
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,920
take not really doing much with called
get cool power meter Reza Google App

732
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,289
Engine

733
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,759
study but I return to product

734
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:53,890
into IRA an idea into a product

735
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,970
and so now you can see how much our that
way how are using people follow its

736
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,380
wanna know how much power they differ

737
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,410
city is you know it I'd like to buy one
of those

738
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,529
pick up my private and then we have our
videos

739
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:10,119
on we got to pick and place machine
really cool machine that place a lot on

740
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,339
micro-star parts

741
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,558
and that's around the same time that we
decided to do a video show called ask an

742
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,410
engineer

743
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,839
arm with your weekly video show its
gonna do tonight

744
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:23,259
I 10 for you here at our studio and %uh
it's an hour asking engineering

745
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:24,170
questions that

746
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,989
more because I asking it to your
questions in person is pretty hard but

747
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:29,650
people can spend all the time

748
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,009
i three specific questions that we can
he's a white Ford and just stuff

749
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:36,099
has been pretty successful several
weekly I have a two thousand people

750
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:40,160
West questions and we have someone to
record it in california they upload it

751
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,700
forced kinda like what's going on with
this

752
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,829
the videos here hope on that's really
useful if you're short do that yourself

753
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,329
it's actually pretty hard it takes a lot
of time to move videos around online

754
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,509
so I started doing that in addition to
all the other videos you do and its

755
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:52,329
first

756
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,759
the median guys used to be like having
authors hope for now we actually think

757
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:59,759
videos are helpful and on like I said
you don't necessarily need to do videos

758
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:00,930
about your product arm

759
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,819
with whatever more popular videos right
now we're going to stick it would be a

760
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:04,910
break so you can see it

761
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,129
is on a project we did and we put this
video up

762
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,829
and you can't buy anything that you see
here but it was one of our biggest days

763
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:17,999
sales hop over to this video

764
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:21,779
base and I'm going to share with you
some information on my latest project

765
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:24,849
before I get too technical details I'd
like you to watch video

766
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:29,190
it to a conference I attended two years
ago

767
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,809
and I from washington and I'm here to
help

768
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:38,220
police on you too there is a video going
around and it says

769
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,599
don't taze me bro

770
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,339
well and non-lethal weapons

771
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:50,450
are really pretty critically a important

772
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:54,249
and so what I have with me is the
basilar

773
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,829
so the dense layer is a seasickness
machine

774
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:01,369
and what it does it uses LED is and it's
a random

775
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:05,619
generator and heat effects your
equilibrium

776
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:08,700
I'm not gonna pointed that I was with a
group for GE

777
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,089
executives yesterday and I held it up
like this and just a reflection made the

778
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:13,880
notions

779
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,390
what we're trying to change from don't

780
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:24,390
Jays me bro who to day as me bro

781
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,770
and that's it

782
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,839
I let me know when you're feeling bad
work thank you

783
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,130
anyway thank you so much suicide look
online to find out more information

784
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,849
and we end up finding some new stories
and tonight Homeland Security is that

785
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:43,400
close to a million dollars on a
flashlight they can't stop you in your

786
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,290
tracks

787
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,790
even law enforcement said it is going to
be controversial

788
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,849
we wanted to see just how effective the
light is

789
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:55,030
okay that's a lot brighter knows what is
in my vision stayed with me for about a

790
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,990
half hour after the test

791
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,690
and then a strong headache Kagan I'm
still a little planning

792
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,869
like most government projects the desert
is actually

793
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:10,040
invented and developed by an outside
consulting firm so we look at some

794
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,549
information about this firm

795
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:14,980
found the patent and looked up exactly

796
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,260
what it is that they did the formal
flashlight flashes green LED's at about

797
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,109
10 hurts

798
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:23,390
this causes flash blindness startling

799
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,950
disorientation vertigo and occasional
vomiting

800
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,369
we thought we could probably do that for
under a million dollars

801
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:34,140
so with that in this project for about
250 bucks and I wish you all the

802
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,879
information so that you can build on
these

803
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,920
at home here's the protecting closure so
I reused

804
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,290
a flashlight that I got from Sears and
so this is the head which for the LED's

805
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,640
electronics inside

806
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,368
this a push-button is how we activated
its am NOT turned on right now

807
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:54,880
am in here is a lead acid battery that
provides power

808
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,250
up here we have thirty-six LED's each
one

809
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,309
has the lands that focuses the optics so

810
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:06,010
lunar move just the lands and you can
see that there's a basic heatsink with

811
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,180
the fan on the back

812
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:12,098
to help with little found heat-seeking
here we have

813
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:15,380
the circuit board we have 6 driver fats

814
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,799
two for each color red green blue we
have

815
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:22,910
a Arduino clone here which I used to

816
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,859
basically do you the pulse width
modulation the UN is a shin and

817
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:33,119
mode selection and there's a wire that
travels down the body to the battery

818
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,420
then behind here

819
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,690
to the movies play there's a 9-volt
battery that powers

820
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,309
just the art we know it's a separate
power supply to avoid that noise that

821
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:44,869
comes

822
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,270
from the pulse width modulation at
reprogramming header for update

823
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,299
updating the firmware and the mode
button which lets me

824
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:56,230
achieve and display it is wanna make one
yourself

825
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,960
we've got the schematics source code and
circuit board last

826
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,390
all available online at radiated got net
slash make

827
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,529
slash be Dazzler you may be wondering

828
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,849
does it really work he does look in the
Subject Tests

829
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:14,260
grades 3-8 to one

830
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:21,260
the

831
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,300
Wow the

832
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,300
my eyes the goggles they do nothing

833
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,440
well turns out doesn't work that well
the

834
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,440
is great for race

835
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,550
okay so that a lot of people are very
nice but it may actually told

836
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,830
nothing know that stuff that we have
another night like the Arduino chip

837
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,490
itself

838
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,680
I'm is for sale in our store this is
just a project that we want to do is

839
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,609
really hit the Department Homeland
Security

840
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:05,390
like what she knows is that guy I just
like I use such ask you some creepy

841
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,140
but but the video went everywhere people
went to lead on that

842
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,330
found the instructions were like this is
really cool and then you start looking

843
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,259
on the side

844
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,369
you know they're like TV on those and
then before you know it you know we had

845
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:18,599
a record sales de

846
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,849
even know there was nothing in that
video for South asap

847
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:27,020
yeah we have just a few more slides or
take some questions so we do this

848
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,540
lecture we do this video is

849
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:32,259
on we cut it with a track everything is
so you know we trip to measure the stuff

850
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,839
on are the wiki has

851
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,359
a lot of this information what are the
things that we did is when we buy weird

852
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,750
new equipment that has

853
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,390
a bunch of people who don't like sharing
information I we put all the information

854
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,920
about mine

855
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,940
sorry about this pick and place machine
is this thirty thousand dollars in a

856
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,359
mitchell katz the tiny parts are we can
make an iPhone in our

857
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,410
apartment now he really wanted to hear
but none

858
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,950
nobody's to share this information so
now in our forums in our wiki

859
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,550
we have the best information about this
now everyone goes are forms first as a

860
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,440
search online cuz

861
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,820
who loves get information and they come
to our forms in like I'm thinking about

862
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,770
buying this machine

863
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,800
and I want to know what you guys think
so all these old timers how these

864
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,400
machines are

865
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,430
are kinda coming outta there shell early
and putting up information like well

866
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,259
just watch out for this what's up for
this part so we're able to

867
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,160
do that a we have a a laser cutter that
we got a few years ago

868
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,710
and we put up all the information about
how to use the laser cutter and then

869
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,420
people started businesses recently a

870
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,170
company sold for $10 million dollars and
all they did was follow our

871
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,880
wiki on how to what laser to buy the
templates for laser etching gadgets

872
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,430
Mac books and iPhones and all that and
they sold it to another company which

873
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:37,980
company

874
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,930
on are other kinda the basic tools that
we use

875
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,379
on the lot is it your price for lawyer
fees so he's gmail for a lot of stuff

876
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,640
cuz you have multiple people

877
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,089
answering some customer support issues
that are

878
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:53,150
order related so more than one person
can can do it

879
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,980
on we use a Google Merchant Center on
you just need to make sure this is

880
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,270
something supported in part

881
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,030
that your products are in an XML file
and you can upload it

882
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,260
and people find it easier for through
Google we use Google Voice because it

883
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,630
transcribes voicemail

884
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,339
and it's a lot better 10 listening to
voicemail it gets look at the words for

885
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:11,910
a quick

886
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,899
a for shipping we use United States
Postal Service for had orders the other

887
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,349
half is

888
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:21,750
UPS we seize fed ex but UPS has a better
API so we're able to do things

889
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,740
a quicker and easier he is in distt for
postage that prints out automatically

890
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,560
I and it weighs it on our scale that we
got off e-bay

891
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,279
and for postal we have a deli pick up to
you can set up

892
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,170
what for and for UPS we have daily pick
up and that saves a lot of time if you

893
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,359
do international sales will be stuck at
the post office

894
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,470
try not to do that on this is what we
use a personal computer

895
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:47,190
scale a bar code reader on a label maker
in this is of course our site

896
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,660
and those things are all commodity off
the shelf stuff and it cost like maybe

897
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,890
a thousand dollars the most on we did it
a talk somewhere

898
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,098
and Pitney Bowes to make this big male
machines kinda freaked out and ask if

899
00:45:58,099 --> 00:45:58,950
they come to our place

900
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,339
and it was just like no smiles all
around like our little thousand-dollar

901
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:03,009
system

902
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,270
blows that hundred thousand dollar like
giant mail things

903
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:10,710
and they're like shit you know we're
gonna do this is the future

904
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,970
you know anywhere like you have it all a
lie to me like a building just like us

905
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:14,500
an ally

906
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:20,170
this it's basically all come I guess
karate harder the scale talks serial

907
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,520
the I'm USB barcode reader I'm

908
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,750
spits out HID that Python can very
easily parsed

909
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:31,359
I'm the printer you know there's some
Python libraries out there as well and

910
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:31,720
then

911
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,290
you know you you skin the invoice it
weighs it

912
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,060
you know talk see the UPS Store USPS API

913
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,310
inference that the label so basically
can ship in like five seconds

914
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,400
you know the exact amount I necessary so
usually if you go to Pitney Bowes Inc

915
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,540
the taxes they say like offer quotes

916
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,570
basic at tender to twenty thousand
dollars per station

917
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:56,160
worse for us to duplicate this station
if we need like to see physicians for

918
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,910
the holidays

919
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,330
it together five hundred dollars I a
base stuff

920
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,650
and during the holidays we have a live
webcam right where people can see a ship

921
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,500
orders and I didn't think it was a
popular

922
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,560
now turns out there's people just want
to watch a ship packages

923
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,589
self it and the place an order and I'll
say hey can you see my back to ISO

924
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:17,210
I'm it so this one looks like every day
this is just the

925
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,530
are all cart and we feel this up until
it gets about the stall

926
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:23,980
and then the postal or the UPS person
shows up and

927
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,990
I that's how we rock it business and I'm
gonna spend just one more minute

928
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,230
and selling near just some quick 4.2 get
this all available

929
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,710
animal few wanna start lining up for
questions wiry read this we still have

930
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,920
to answer questions

931
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,619
on these are the 15 things you need to
do if you want to start an open source

932
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:40,089
hardware

933
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:44,049
business after you leave the session for
this is very juicy

934
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:47,819
itself its own 30-minute presentation
I'm so the first step is to see this

935
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:50,220
killer interest or something you're
really good at

936
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,560
am if you're not sure disaster friends
will probably tell you and it probably

937
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,049
the thing you wish you really get that
but it's something you really gonna

938
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,319
anyways

939
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:01,849
I'm it seems to be true and then not
think about the name for your company

940
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:05,050
I'm make sure it is this fellow just
like people like to like true love

941
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,400
18 he's in there and it's very hard to
spell something like that so

942
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,869
and then you can say over the phone
bombing people remember it

943
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,280
comes in handy out once you've got a
good name and you've done like the most

944
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,470
basic trademark search in just like you
know checking with your

945
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,240
city or state they they have a database
you can look to see if there's any

946
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,990
registered company that name I'm then
back to the domain name reports getting

947
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,540
all the dot match in a very issue
spelling streets

948
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,390
six dollars a year you might just get
them all not the file a TBA with your

949
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,560
city or state is cut cost about thirty
to fifty dollars

950
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,540
context couple hours is very simple and
then that's your business going

951
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,609
right to deny her if industries not just
you know the Morrisville

952
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:46,650
on this digital camera I'm to use a
camera phone can actually pretty good

953
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,210
camera

954
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,880
have to be like a DSL fellas are used on
the Canon

955
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,020
staff and she does turn dollars you know
five years ago to use that for many many

956
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,589
years and its fine a tripod will help a
lot

957
00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:01,440
getting some good lights there's
thousands of tutorials on how to do like

958
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,530
fifty dollar

959
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:06,910
I'm softbox light setups on on
Instructables or unlike

960
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,790
Lifehacker okay so now you have to have
a couple projects going to make an

961
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,250
executive available for a variety
because you don't know what people are

962
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,099
gonna end up wanting 6824

963
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:19,250
is a good idea and then take all these
photos and then find one photo that's

964
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:19,780
like

965
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,099
really iconic photo I'm you something
that

966
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,839
so that explains everything that it dies
and yeah I don't take a photo that the

967
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:27,619
parts

968
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:31,940
take a photo doing the thing it does
like for example I'm Michiru STV gone if

969
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,560
your gonna photo TV on

970
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,410
to be someone turning off the TV right I
mean you may not be able to the TV got

971
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,930
their hands but the action

972
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,640
what they're doing is important at night
tell your doctor if some Linux

973
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,109
open-source hardware you can you know
publish them

974
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:49,109
schematic some cat files and and you
know these photos and everything

975
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:53,040
and they have to your pricing and this
is something that out such people out

976
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,040
because it is a well to stretch a little
bit more than what it cost me

977
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,300
I'm but that's actually am you're gonna
have and the Bruins because it's never

978
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,359
as little as you think it is all these

979
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,560
other little things like taxes and fees
and

980
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,040
and shipping costs so I'm you know
something so well double

981
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,130
the parts casa even that's not enough
because I'm if you do that you're okay

982
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,710
but you'll never be able to expand
having resellers

983
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:18,599
and unless your ex in less you're gonna
you ship internationally stress in your

984
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,270
life

985
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,540
you wanna distributor so show it to you
margins

986
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,839
a forty-percent so that's system percent
markup

987
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,799
I'm get some inventory but some ppl Buy
It Now buttons on your website

988
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,190
and then you know start email people you
think might be interested in the gobi

989
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,300
spammy but just you know blogs and

990
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,869
or I'm forums that are egyptians staff
to say hey this is really cool check

991
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:42,280
this out let me know if you're
interested in purchasing it

992
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,270
I'm you make a website you realize I do
that or repressor whenever

993
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,550
I'm have course have a way to contact
you and maybe even a photo of

994
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,980
who you are so it's not like some creepy
website am

995
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,430
and that's what your web stacks and see
what people say I'm on these blogs and

996
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,390
forums and

997
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:02,069
how people respond to e-mail you when
and don't don't find out what it is that

998
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:03,210
they want to email you

999
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,190
repetitively saying something something
something this thing and then

1000
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,650
that's your products you can start with
that and then I this gets repeated and

1001
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,130
try to come out with like two or three
things a year

1002
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,660
and they'll keep interest high to you
and stagnating can you know when you

1003
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,520
have success because it feels just like
panic

1004
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,580
said 6 same emotion okay sorry to take
some questions on the

1005
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,100
got there with us again

1006
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,950
but first thing the Salem Ore your
documentation is

1007
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,770
when I get their high-water mark
actually held up a number times for

1008
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,150
people saying this is what

1009
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:41,150
really good documentation should be hey
I'm

1010
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,180
other question is like I'm from Canada
and anytime we order anything from the

1011
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,680
state's

1012
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,970
sparked when you get better shipping is
always a pain in the ass

1013
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,470
um I know you ship UPS in the oval
standing at your front door with your

1014
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,980
packages like yeah I won 30 bucks or as
a negative

1015
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,770
yeah UPS UPS and FedEx they don't even
really warn you about that although you

1016
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,750
now they have a service where

1017
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,900
you can pay that up front but that's why
we don't suggest UPS it came in a

1018
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,420
magazine

1019
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,549
UPS will get it together in one day and
personal take two weeks the personal is

1020
00:52:09,549 --> 00:52:10,600
with you off

1021
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,089
yeah but a just is there a reason you
guys on offer FedEx is typical with

1022
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:15,830
FedEx

1023
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:19,839
everything is in the cost I'm not
standing there in a bathroom that's not

1024
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,779
true actually

1025
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,580
I they actually do mail your letter
later and if you don't pay it

1026
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,040
I have to pay I so I don't offer FedEx
because like I said when pat you know it

1027
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,700
isn't your back is to Canada

1028
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,450
maybe even recently very recently last
few months change this but

1029
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,560
sending packages so we didn't pay it I
got hit with a couple hundred dollar

1030
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,400
bill

1031
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,480
I'm and select likely that person is
very nice they did pay it

1032
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,460
but I'm it there's always that

1033
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,350
the talk to FedEx and UPS that they will
they they want 300 should somebody

1034
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:52,910
I'm it's not clear who you know what
that said I'm gonna take the step in a

1035
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,020
video and send it to the small
businesses Asian and US cuz if you don't

1036
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,530
like

1037
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,660
efficiency like you want to buy stuff
candidate like I thought nafta solve

1038
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,899

okay like it all right we're gonna try
to get to this message again so there's

1043
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:16,839
a lot over

1044
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:20,299
intellectual property involved obviously
how much legal support

1045
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:23,940
have you needed on so far not but

1046
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,310
iight we did have run into a problem
with on

1047
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,970
development we had a image on our site
that says we don't sell blinking

1048
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,089
Christmas trees

1049
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:35,609
and they still blinking Christmas trees
and they got what it is like my lawyers

1050
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:37,990
to send this is like a cease and desist
like letter

1051
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:41,660
so we had to contact the FF every it and
then they were like

1052
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,200
so Lake we they got annoyed cuz I think
we're doing well

1053
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,600
but they were upset that we said that we
don't sell something if there's

1054
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,880
because we think with the Christmas
trees are kinda dumb

1055
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,690
so you have a situation where somebody
are make something interesting but they
