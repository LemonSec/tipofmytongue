1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,299
well

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,660
thanks yeah so to the WikiLeaks thing
was

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,879
quite interesting but so love about me
in in the summer ice

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,410
I'm so rough with on the team leader for
proactive risk

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,689
where favorite thing to company I'm also
sitting on the board directors for the

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,720
OWASP foundation so one of the things I
was mention with WikiLeaks which I

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,689
completely support

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:31,150
his ability to write open software into
event was around the world so for that

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:31,740
we use

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,000
does affect everyone's life for those
who don't know

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,690
OWASP does the open web application
security

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,899
product we have 21,000 members

13
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,840
about 160 chapters worldwide 118
different projects for me from testing

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,410
guides

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,410
how to break stuff to headed to secure
development such a sweet deficit in half

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,000
looking at I'm here in New York City

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,730
my head up team with the other chapter
me the members

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,609
you were here out quickly produce wait
for now time Ryan

19
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,700
quite and flat those members are have
you lost him

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,479
and am this little information here so
I'm sorry I come on the brink or DOD to

21
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,030
be working space for quite some time

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,369
I'm with four kids I something amazing

23
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:23,060
pirates and ninjas these days basic when
I have as I have a 30 gram fire a better

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,310
pirates and the rest you don't see on
the screen images because they don't be

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,869
a party starts which is quite funny on

26
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,310
so the talk outline some folks in a
couple things that I am

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,180
have begun a lot of publicity kinda the
conserve what is a red team has a

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,040
workhorse people about Red Team

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,170
bonds definitions various

30
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,049
ways that the six hundred other when red
team is actually a proper within an

31
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:46,979
organization

32
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,840
adversary modeling miles a bright lights

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,320
else you like the bad guy some through
some scenarios

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,780
it's gonna be a lot of our conversations
will happen between kiss the top it's

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,850
pretty attractive

36
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,079
was also 250 handouts the response to
arrive

37
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,380
they're not here even at the rally so
that's

38
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,410
unfortunate that will push to that and
again we're through some

39
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,209
attack exercise as well so red teaming

40
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,860
as defined by the US Army catch you
folks that were involved in media

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,160
privateer I'm certainly a

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,470
a structured process to look at I'm

43
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,569
look at the context operational
environment to basically determine if in

44
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,060
fact

45
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,480
credible threat to potentially cause
damage or harm to the environment

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,488
right so the concert to looking at your
organization or

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,790
government should have component there
determining Creek dist

48
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,290
solely your sister be compromised need
better than attacked by rats sorry if so

49
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,510
Fisher absecon Awareness Week would fall
into this category we have a

50
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,299
a defender an attacker the attacker
kinda from the attacker side if anything

51
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,540
Cindy defender side

52
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,000
and cover table top exercise would start
am

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,629
census I to find a little bit
differently for some that

54
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:04,170
know who senses census kinda more focus
on a network sites reasonable time in

55
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,330
that area as well

56
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,500
up the sense that finish in is
definitely focus more on which used to

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,480
it via the pen testing or the networks
for the side effects

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,690
Twilight the best is actually red
teaming defined as the following

59
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,290
authorized

60
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,140
keyword authorized adversarial base
assessment services for defensive

61
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,120
purposes that's

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,659
that's the kind of the concert whatever
teams use for critical infrastructure

63
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:33,429
I'm is kinda the focal point for me
opportunity the focal point for

64
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,049
the services that improve on it for many
many years I'm

65
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,110
yet the organizations across the board
here these about the team

66
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,950
areas are critical infrastructure better
deemed important to society those being

67
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,140
financial services

68
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,190
food gas power electrical sector Israel

69
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,859
areas that any one of them could
substantially impact our social economic

70
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,640
conditions here

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,709
and certainly our people Warner gases
such so

72
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,950
he's was considered critical
infrastructure Joel it sells baskets

73
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,470
online

74
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,819
may be important job but doesn't fall
into that particular category

75
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,659
recommendations to really have
stakeholders

76
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,019
as any other project does these products
could be various

77
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,980
individuals but it typically involves a
lot of individuals and organizations

78
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,009
so with your the or if your organization

79
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,049
you're the head at the the
organization's

80
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,750
focal point insuring that logistics
happened to

81
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,000
to provide provide society

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,500
developers designers maintains a center
is made for people are typically apart

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,680
I love the the the involvement of the
organization those testing so

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,570
security to the non-secure profession
start leases have been happening for

85
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,490
many many years right so the cock the
Casa get reviewed and updated

86
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,500
things like your DMC's stamps

87
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,430
signatures allusion these are not new in
any situation imagination but

88
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,290
today in 2010 I'm expected to involve

89
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,240
the Trojan horse you're being one of the
ones everyone knows the big four special

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,990
to the castle

91
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,750
abuse have concepts are constantly
reinvented with the car

92
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,930
on space here is what we are trying to
do is in as a technology space

93
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,020
community trying to drive uses a bit
forward from both maybe the attacker

94
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,090
as well as the builders so you the
dollar burgers from philosophy

95
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,199
so again retrieving to fight authorized

96
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,580
are still based assessments accused for
defensive purposes we use for this

97
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,008
particular talk

98
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,759
you were there being of rest the
presidency with deal control the

99
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,930
facility assistance to be assessed

100
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,900
view the individuals that to be we can
invoke the sleeve

101
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,810
suspense reviews is after several based

102
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,669
so it's it's not in Sec

103
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,508
the regiment user to be guided by one or
adversaries

104
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:52,539
with the knowledge have crossed team
that has very skills

105
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,000
conserve resources up relative to the
culture that we're trying to assess for

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,750
test

107
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,949
so this is actually at a fairly
important us like

108
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,210
I'm this like kinda illustrates the
different types

109
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,609
every team slasher team activities am

110
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,050
some you may be more familiar with a

111
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,280
professor but design assurance in itself
has great team folks that are typically

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,500
assigned to the design of a system this
is not going to be any sort of a fancy

113
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,889
taking the dorsal should

114
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,210
near trick somebody with a phishing
attacks in a conversation

115
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,289
it's gonna be deal to individuals and as
first in specially-designed insurance

116
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:29,949
rates

117
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:34,400
there look at the organization's new
which determine if that power system

118
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,550
is going to stand up to normal
threatened more attacks

119
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,550
I will hear a team game again this could
be more exercises with that looking

120
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,800
across the table

121
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,169
and determining in fact am kind of like
playing

122
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,280
if you will benchmarking for teams that
look

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,860
against systems to measure their
processor offenders compared to others

124
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,949
in the summer class

125
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,740
operational team sprint analytical in a
the ones are star there is the

126
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,009
penetration testing is

127
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,440
were kinda spend more time into in that
particular area

128
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,050
sir when his red teaming appropriate

129
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,630
its its it's not appropriate for simple
systems

130
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,699
it's not appropriate for a simple system
here's a

131
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,289
here's an environment that's Joe's
basket weaving was determined how

132
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:19,669
Venable maybe

133
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,240
but it is certainly appropriate for
complex systems are intertwined

134
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,069
that part I potentially critical
infrastructure

135
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,270
systems with unknown consequences right
those are appropriate

136
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,090
where that process control systems that
can result in human life

137
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,400
def those are fairly important so these
are systems that you might wanna have

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,970
teams and individuals that are folks in
particular areas te systems to the

139
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,870
outcome should be

140
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,229
life right to be human life so there's
there's a a balance there

141
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,370
one other freeze like we said it
certainly did missus

142
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,120
I said damn it all the custom IC I'm so
is if

143
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,509
this this this testing actually go
sideways I am

144
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,080
what country is the worst-case outcome
well he'll have a financial interest

145
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,690
financial disruption our business cause
stock price changes such as: okay well

146
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,419
backup is anyone fishing and dry is
there any sort of you

147
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,520
impact a human life an answer site map
not just its

148
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,539
financial what we had some coffee

149
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,750
when we come back we'll talk about your
your financial losses because that

150
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,699
obviously is

151
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,840
forced the character fairly important
but it ended today

152
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,050
all activity should be looked upon with
you might be feeling for

153
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,560
if you're not ready for extreme answer

154
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,349
hmmm organizations to plead don't
contract for Skype services to a third

155
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,159
party

156
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,240
lester ready to have a a real reality
check as to

157
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,680
potentially his earnings in the arm
right because if there's being that if

158
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,209
you look full scope you look at things
that are going to potentially in

159
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,980
different areas you look at

160
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,830
areas that might be a physical tryna
you're trying to wireless networks

161
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,610
social engineering people human to
center

162
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,320
so it's very very wide so not only for
Sarries

163
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,779
are certainly de klerk your abilities
and what's really really important

164
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,350
with most organizations determining
potentially what their threats

165
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,360
so if the organization is concerned

166
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,330
potential use of couple throughout their
if you're especially concerned with a

167
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,490
safe

168
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,080
Greenpeace as potentially being problem
in their world because that's a very

169
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,180
beat do experiments on animals as an
example of that would obviously be a

170
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,550
adversary with certain capabilities and
and funding censure

171
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,980
and this organization and to the right
potentially would have impact

172
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,790
federalization was too much publicized
her

173
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,790
conduct a smear campaign against himself
looking in the in the

174
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,959
in the public sector that might take
sets without ever looking at power gas

175
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,089
fear in the city for looking at how your
critical infrastructure systems much

176
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:50,470
electricity blackouts here Center those
potential systems could be classified

177
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,290
I'm Vetter going to be looked upon as
potentially adversaries that after

178
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,980
niskanen of all the time

179
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,470
to determine if they can have too many
control for particular facts so

180
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,209
it's completely different based on the
scope of the project in

181
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,329
department uses each one is quite
different disgruntled

182
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,279
employees administrators insiders a
sutter these are always of course the

183
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,079
most

184
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,410
difficult people to guard against
because they have a gym access right

185
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,279
there in the system

186
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,279
their backs certain controls know where
the skeletons in the session

187
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,300
and in many cases when required to put
back doors in themselves or they simply

188
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,709
leave things open

189
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,519
because a really haven't spent the time
to close on the funeral today fused

190
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,519
YouTube it'll become from important

191
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,820
so with that

192
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,089
the motivation the attacker types
typically one to three different buckets

193
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,709
ominous actually interesting I had
worked for organization

194
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:48,269
that used to be so the terms speak about
a particular a rare

195
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:52,420
their business I look at it more as a a
very true statement that

196
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,829
you have to read in action is the
adversary individual that's going to

197
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:01,339
look to make a quick buck going to go
after and try to find a quick system to

198
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,570
team and Java could be any organization
anyone European IdeaCentre

199
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,500
and they're gonna go out there is a tent
that anywhere they possibly can

200
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,660
but felt kinda friend losses for the
organization is

201
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,579
you may also then have individuals that
are more carries a team of people are

202
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,220
several people that want to focus on
potentially

203
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,810
an organization after today a crazy your
small business

204
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,610
say I an organization might have the
goods that they want the true that

205
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,829
they're looking to find

206
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:30,480
and lastly the fleet are lesser the
fully turned adversary could be the

207
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
people on our stage

208
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,149
the fleet our team is going to be even
with various expertise in various

209
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:37,829
different a respected assemble for that
purpose

210
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:41,000
to put in a great word conversation
exactly how we break

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,070
we still this can we take this down and
again the day

212
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,920
probably be quite successful because
most organizations never been punched in

213
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,769
the face

214
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:51,500
that understand what it means take a
punch the conversation of saying you

215
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,810
I'm all we secure in many different
areas is to be tested in 10 different

216
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,430
sir feel like the bad guy cell

217
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,380
force what families are the most
important to the answer your YouTube

218
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,269
hands on the

219
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,670
objectives so if you're looking for
treasure information

220
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,209
goal on that might be one particular
point maybe its intellectual property

221
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,880
maybe it's a cure for cancer that you
know there's rumors that we've church

222
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,139
casper we're not going to be

223
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:20,260
the the money that's what I to the
industry is also some interesting

224
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,050
conspiracy theories as we have and hope
every year every two years

225
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,079
I'm fears is currently directing is
kinda

226
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,010
kinda dark art but the same time it is
becoming some

227
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,389
it's becoming a little federalize with
mir individuals involved in the process

228
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:38,800
on experience really comes from allies
in the Beatles attacks

229
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,079
prior right systems that have been
broken into cameras that have happened

230
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,300
military operations that have happened
successfully such as taking down

231
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,459
many control systems radar stations for
attacks are made

232
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,519
some lent let me use of these different
experiences

233
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,870
quickly applied to civilian sorta
organizations

234
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,670
it's very important Russian what key
please %uh view the torture tactics

235
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,810
so regulars you're certainly miss you so

236
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,790
shame exercise in Prince in and also
restraint

237
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,769
in most cases because I think the day I
am I kinda callers to believe three

238
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,220
different types every team's

239
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,910
the first ever a team is the first new
phone the fans ahead you had internet

240
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,250
organizations are a clash a lot of money
will be happy to do it right kinda

241
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,370
12 years for attack University
individuals that might say

242
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,290
yet we're gonna go ahead and use a
commercial for processes such a very

243
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:29,910
very fine

244
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,579
if in scope or look at an environment
thus a public-facing

245
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,070
systems and come up with a result in say
based on the commercial

246
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,529
in review of what we've done in the
manual validation yeah you're you're

247
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,350
good to go you're totally secure

248
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,930
company had the other two folks there
come here involving

249
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,060
the conversation wall any way possible
but was for you

250
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,850
so for some in the room I think you
shoulda should know somebody's people on

251
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,440
here

252
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,440
because they work with us time

253
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,010
high-tech some of the most

254
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:12,010
on sex

255
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,940
haha sq %ah

256
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:24,940
past sash %ah I

257
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,840
see our security systems test

258
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,500
heists sales

259
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,500
free insists hi she to put your hands

260
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,610
a dark showing us how many folks you're
free with

261
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,050
Chris Dickerson national tired text so

262
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,510
so so having a having individuals and in
our

263
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,040
in our circle if community will live at
are

264
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,839
making it very well known in kind of
getting into the space it's it's a it's

265
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,070
a very good thing

266
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,500
for the industry because organizations
have a full security

267
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,540
the same time on there should be always
concerned relative to Michael double its

268
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,449
Nexus tragedies

269
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,340
the concept there is that these
individuals the team to perform such

270
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,850
functions

271
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,160
to believe ass is very very sensitive
data versus in information from various

272
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,569
attack vectors in the day I I I've
actually had a

273
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,690
she has issued a colleague we sat there
transferring money to the Federal

274
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,850
Reserve System and I was like

275
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,190
five dollars in some 40 Z call
helicopters like you

276
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,380
it was very interesting on exactly what
could happen mom

277
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,450
during summers assessment so the concept
is that it's always important

278
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:48,970
to the of being the bad guy the
conversation whether it be

279
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,120
a taking down systems or break into

280
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,000
organizations an axis systems from there
involvement you know the methodology

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,300
tied back to typical red timmy's
straightforward

282
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,160
right so we're trying to culture is
something that could put some

283
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,020
information to Israel for some exercise

284
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,410
lights the first thing about the
methodologies how the planning right so

285
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,540
the conversation what are we trying to
understand what

286
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,180
announces are we trying to accomplish on
the half

287
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,430
love the question what is the question
we're trying to stop intellectual

288
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,970
property

289
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,740
water nightmares consequences what is
our problem we're trying to

290
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,750
determine other perpetrator boundaries
around very important happened and scope

291
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,970
I'm

292
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,070
today clutch phone is fairly important
as well

293
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,340
I roll 22 the systems designed the
sector because again depending on what

294
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,120
type a free tonight if you're performing

295
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,980
in many cases to be just color open book
review: right you working with the

296
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,040
organization to

297
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,130
bring the subject matter experts that
are experts in a particular field

298
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,640
looking at systems and be able to
distinguish that characterization

299
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,819
his be able to drive toward
opportunities relative to the

300
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,550
organization what is the business really
do

301
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,220
an in-depth commercial space was a real
business rates other mail server

302
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,310
right is it may not be there file server
room potential competition today what

303
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:04,948
exactly

304
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,360
does your organization do have a
congress he announces

305
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,690
part is really really important as well
because the other families that are

306
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,839
potentially found within an organization
used to be few minutes could be

307
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,179
Technical Center I'm putting together
campaign image from our nation's really

308
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,600
really important am what's irresponsible
is

309
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,199
must be successfully exploited to
achieve goals

310
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,000
began somebody's actually can't be
actually replicated sometimes people

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,600
exercises

312
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,020
are enough to say that if this scenario
did take place if these three things

313
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,650
that we can visually show you

314
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,350
were able to be accomplished step 4 in 5
2-3 text could lead to

315
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,719
week you can invest those situations are
quite interesting because it shows bit

316
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,120
more

317
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,690
so return lights are off in a few
exercise to run through

318
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,900
okay so in the year

319
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,800
from the first carrier I'm what I'd like
to try to accomplish

320
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,120
is kinda show a couple things will get
that later

321
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,290
albert's in the first letter collective
take a look at the

322
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,340
the slide and return this.name trashy
white people shout out the answers right

323
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,459
so as an electrician you're in for info
use a light 30 flights

324
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,500
hey from the Sun behind was a light
switch on the wall

325
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,880
the late is currently on so shut out
will try to let him down here

326
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,080
five ways to turn off the light like the
ball

327
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,689
record its

328
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,220
unscrew the bolt plug the hole okay some
publishers

329
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,060
that's utterly ask someone else

330
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,159
of York

331
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,780
gone for the National five components

332
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:50,240
a functioning well one for

333
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,730
go down and Karen 5xa

334
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,600
on I get is usually 10 it isn't running
quickly kisses I love

335
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,380
suffered violent I'm fine with that of a
light is off again based on the premise

336
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,230
if you're in the building

337
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,280
here during the Rams help lines of

338
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
to 3 leach

339
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,520
X

340
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,790
this this one could be fun five ways to
prevent someone from being able to turn

341
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:23,790
off the light sign its

342
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:32,850
for Juventus in a real five again is a
reference to my skull computer for his

343
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,340
art he did

344
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,139
series called Jack which is really
really interesting in this Ricky

345
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,370
Nationals

346
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,710
I'm so now what's changed is better your
soldier

347
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,400
you're you're so dreadful feel you're
doing more Excel

348
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,630
let's go back to me or via your station
at the only bridge or potential crossing

349
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:49,920
right

350
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,590
and give us five ways repair for the
enemy coming

351
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,899
one again to

352
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,850
for clearance my confirm mind a bridge
to

353
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:08,540
extra Drake tell me more tell it's okay
figures for

354
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,040
better balance CoolChaser outside the
way for the bridge that might work

355
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,820
into your I'm fire her boss

356

trailer don't

359
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,590
dont chance response rights is a couple
different areas there too

360
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,909
and five problems any could cause if
they cross the bridge

361
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,520
1 %ah

362
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,810
few access so it's gonna last

363
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,530

will strengthen you and your some

364
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,399
people's hearts

365

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,470
the outer first question 5 question
asked by does the problem set up

369
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,990
%ah

370
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,289
is a participant

371
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:13,049
actual actress how did you how did you
break a good question try to fix it

372
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:13,679
extract

373
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,659
sack was a question %uh 55 resources
might use to help solve the problem

374
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:24,110
to

375

5 concerned the caller may have

377
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:44,080
with following your advice section

378
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,200
and

379
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,300
what are the five ways we can ensure
better service %ah

380
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,440
on Calif wheeze

381
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,730
mars forest his last this was actually
fun your time in fish

382
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,600
because we work at night right that's
like your specs so are five ways to

383
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,120
choose the best times

384
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,270
till intelligence observations less than
Rs in tons of fish

385

sick friends in the time addition access
easy escape

mechanisms which you may have to avoid

387
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,500

Josh here

388
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,620
fact alarms dogs carts

389
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:48,620

390
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,480
you can make from each job maybe work
alone

391
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,480
friends for their districts look to

392

have you got don't get caught Friday
night

393
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,380
for there's a story idea

394
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,050
first I've heard one on the snare first
Rob Vanstone

395
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,879
so the concert scenarios sources

396
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,490
this is fairly straightforward right
because enterprise complex use GoDaddy

397
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,690
right so we all know that over the last
ten fifteen years involved in the space

398
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,130
some research on the same age

399
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,870
yesterday technology gets more and more
entrenched his mama

400
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,540
banquets for solutions for problems and
has more technologies France's money is

401
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,409
being deployed

402
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,830
players such a dinner today this come
down to her kinda win right so look into

403
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,540
the scenario components is very
important because if you want for this

404
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,629
area like this

405
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,770
questions okay we're star and was our
goal

406
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,470
water trash ratso ratings to do we have
to focus on this particular chart

407
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,170
problem which is what is our treasure
what is your call

408
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,890
we went to be stealthy is such such such
a so these conversations to be clear

409
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,390
real

410
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,110
relative to express complex really comes
down to is organization from

411
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,930
right so from an organizational
perspective what is the actual

412
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,180
perceived threat it's not your head is
going to be some kids in his basement

413
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,560
hacking website is now own the house I
have a big basement private is is that

414
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,280
its looking to determine exactly what
threadgill actually exist in your

415
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,840
environment

416
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,850
right you might be that electrician with
aplomb early maybe

417
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,790
if your help desk I as many different
ways how user scenarios

418
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,750
as a fifty exercise right so it's it's
not always about technologies

419
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,030
no tech package improve you need the
right expertise

420
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,570
as needed to accomplish the goals writes
the people in the room

421
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,570
it's just that is an ethics issue by
Franklin

422
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,179
right if you're not working on the red
team are usually work Black team so

423
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,590
working with the attack vectors the
weaknesses and secure trolls a

424
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,449
potentially my view

425
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,530
place is really important because of
course be able to detect something that

426
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:57,850
actually

427
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,640
happens fairly interesting as well so
defensive offense involving

428
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,920
make a lot of sense having for it could
threaten house is probably the most

429
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,990
important piece of advice for getting
fees

430
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,060
conversation testing terminology i think
is important because

431
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,960
is kind of a lot in sick to work out
there coming bill should both test in

432
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,520
time

433
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,600
looking at things like police carrying
security testing something like that you

434
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,120
have to look at

435
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,130
kinda cost value effect what you're
trying to accomplish

436
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,040
in many cases perfectly acceptable to
look at if a system potentially

437
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,050
is flammable to known problems done
System Center typecasting

438
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,210
to minimize misconfigured something like
that in other cases not wright's full

439
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,490
not because they didn't nothing quite
frankly this is actually used against

440
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,820
the organization intellectual property
theft

441
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,260
I'm so you have various scenarios
actively pop up in many times we find

442
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,570
ourselves in getting into

443
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,590
vaccines resistant vacuums about week

444
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,950
patch in the system doesn't really make
a difference right sir

445
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,380
what's your Corbis exactly do you do
where can he be really her to kick in

446
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,930
the balls

447
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,570
that's the composition you try to get it
so again

448
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,129
based on again the demographic in the
room you looked

449
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,190
10,001+ so sits just a cation

450
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,790
attacker kinda person shooter knowledge

451
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,110
is lot of different things that take
place but you know nowadays

452
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,500
how many people can quickly download you
know w3 af

453
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,090
work in grad Metasploit urging get you
know access to commercial support tools

454
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,430
but the chain these effects
organizations really really important

455
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,210
because again

456
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,360
it's not difficult in most cases the cop
was a system

457
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,640
right because it does have a known for
months then it will be discovered

458
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,290
will be laws against such system what's
more important is the change affects

459
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,240
fact that organization so back into

460
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,960
another exercise when it's second is
looking at kinda valuating

461
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,670
organizations are pertains to a couple
thanks the first thing is visible

462
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,780
right so what can be seen again looking
at kinda footprint organization going

463
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,629
through this process

464
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,180
which many view go through every day
just don't know it

465
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,830
because you're your working for burden
to the day

466
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,909
that's kinda what could be seen as a
present we face in prisons for the

467
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,800
organization

468
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,180
I'm you began civil based network world
opener Phil too poor to censure

469
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,260
on these things are fairly important you
what your potential applications are

470
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,830
using

471
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,389
on his lot of information relative to
your organization

472
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,490
decided to kill you for this great big
network and kinda

473
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,810
fees publicly in addition to that you
many folks

474
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,370
many folks are using things like a like
the league a

475
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,420
weight gainer Twitter yeah

476
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,120
other systems and baby has a national
Robin sage

477
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,400
she s for 10 bucks

478
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,200
Sony the visibility pieces is
interesting

479
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,630
access access the system to ski people
have asked the system's

480
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:56,120
you know developers have access to
systems what circle it was horrible

481
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,690
try try try harder than ex-employee that
has access to information

482
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,760
trying to win paid for him to give me
some detail background information about

483
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,150
when you talk to bernie to knock over

484
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,370
is our laptop personal carly was
installed by some

485
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,290
drug users who want to get a quick lap
up 2.9 was released on January

486
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,350
was it was formed scams bar for four
hours

487
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,730
on the gym today systems are potential
under attack

488
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,350
if you return the organization if you
have something to hide the apps again

489
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,720
people two billion is for money I'm

490
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,190
looking at situations trust research
that's really important

491
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,070
them how many people have to deal with
situations where you have remained uses

492
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,300
an environment that are using your
personal

493
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,430
machines and management networking
organizations

494
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:43,110
very tight the connecting organization
have limited ability to control said

495
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,200
workstations

496
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,540
executive system from home that is
through your own fire olin

497
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,639
two-year-old use these are these are
citizens are

498
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,090
again typically not in your controllers
organization

499
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,500
looking at you with a gathering place
for an organization to be able to

500
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,060
identify

501
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,550
alert and be able to mitigate that in
fact there has been a problem we bridge

502
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,010
with an organization

503
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,040
that potential is going towards the
treasure right so this could be

504
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,710
something it's very happens very quickly

505
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,460
could happen over a period of time in
the day be able to log file analysis

506
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,950
looking at systems is fairly important

507
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,310
on the network site so so I don't fit
the search however

508
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:26,080
view events come from whitehat security
but if you look at kind of the

509
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,689
the concepts you have a website we all
cities in China printer

510
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,390
contextual stuff I'm what's wrong with
this picture

511
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,950
you whether 18 what do you do not attack
you

512
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,150
shana to exercise 6

513
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,950
K session ID are down good no was a
selfish to

514
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,180
sequels actions 3 my kids are right

515
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,540
next well here's here's how I look at it

516
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,580
rights of some folks for a look at a
system base for

517
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,860
examples earlier really as a kind of
wordpress

518
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,050
rights I promise had a lie fuck with you
today how do I get to this particular

519
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,500
system as to what is after trying to
protect

520
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,010
so we can talk about you know now where
we talk about mobile devices

521
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,420
web application talk about any system
put into said bucket

522
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,110
law only comes down to what come to
threaten conversation

523
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,480
because again is a combination that has
to happen

524
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,740
again the kind the full scope exercise
between

525
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,990
it said security social engineering
while security three cases such as these

526
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,700
days all intertwined

527
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,060
so we live in a vacuum we don't believe
that this is actually true

528
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,230
iight shyness Craig but

529
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,550
today hopefully organization have
intellectual property to protect

530
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,639
would agree but these are fairly
important than the entire enterprise

531
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,550
resource for the users

532
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,290
for many many years I recall working for
a bank sure in the city and one of the

533
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,760
conversation was at

534
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,020
you're not going to worry about
education to the end-user because

535
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,510
they're too stupid to understand

536
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:02,860
invest the money to teach them act I'm
really Shannon a conversation because

537
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,400
that was the people that were

538
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,590
potentially a gateway to to chaos same
graph

539
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,500
Wiese year organization said %uh
developers gonna spend the time trying

540
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,000
to educate knows guys gonna be firing
two years

541
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,710
we're gonna go away outsourcing Mike so
you are

542
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,330
trying to run an organization you don't
rush staff over here you don't rush

543
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,560
effort to try to protect its
intellectual which over here

544
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,110
to very soft and mushy in most cases so
you know at a higher level rise

545
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,610
it's very 6 look at exactly what's going
on sir

546
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:39,500
played two more games here's the first

547
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,870
now this was important seem to have your
left with your hands

548
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,740
stuff abused just

549
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,919
world yeah exactly services for pure

550
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,320
listen listen listen to haley knows the
answer at a time please don't wanna

551
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,909
funny videos

552
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,790
tasks touch

553
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,918
count of how many times class for what
past

554
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:09,919
ask

555
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,530
okay so how many passes to check out

556
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,870
one beer so far we consider first part

557
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,970
15 is the right answer wants better from
get

558
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,110
fight for but for the rescue in the room

559
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,520
you guess how the last capped crept past

560
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,400
is fifty asks TC

561
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I

562
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,510
just simon's Quest Scott

563
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,770
with permission sup

564
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,450
the so with that just goes to show is
that your focus to

565
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,870
too much on what he believed to be the
objective potentially

566
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,830
should television rest right sewer pick
up your brain games real quick

567
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,559
so the first point gonna do cement
rightward

568
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,600
to run another sense you a shout out
first fashion shouts out the right

569
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,150
answer

570
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:49,150
wins shredding white year

571
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,510
answers water Care Act next spot

572
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:59,720
an ass

573
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,610
go is a ransom in the back wrenched

574
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:09,289
I'm in a min

575
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:12,419
can't get me you learned again alright
so

576
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,748
so really the conversation here as we
expand into other areas series are

577
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:16,769
talking about here

578
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:20,339
the all mighty mighty mule mighty
reaching its ocean years as their victim

579
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:23,739
to provide all the information to
potential need certainly happen in some

580
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,418
scenarios

581
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:27,739
but in fact there are fairly technical
on such as well

582
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,569
need to be done by technical folks at
the same time is always good to have

583
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,569
you she was a specific manner that are
going to be party to testing

584
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:38,079
I'm sure we'll look at another Sony were
present

585
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,079
so again

586
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:49,710
if we would agree this again is an
example of how your mind

587
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,440
you know as a few min kinda looks at
things and kind of comes up your

588
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,859
interpretation result

589
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,690
because again it doesn't necessarily
need to have all

590
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,119
pitcher for kinda says a for kinda
paints a picture so

591
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,059
with allusion came back to our trench
earlier

592
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:08,219
have been around for ever pain slave
Hanna center

593
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:11,319
there's many cases where that an
organization can be fun to do

594
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:15,288
right into kinda acting as you need them
to act right is more important to come

595
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:18,269
to an organization as an example cause a
problem

596
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:22,289
be the solution and then ask for
something as we've already solve their

597
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:22,789
problems

598
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,509
you trust assets so this is very
interesting how psychology as a very big

599
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:26,960
game

600
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,710
in the overall picture before success so
some suggestions

601
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,769
I'm sheer people at ask you know what

602
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:38,499
should be do or how to get involved news
have a very sore involving redeeming

603
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,069
begin with

604
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:43,239
I always kinda point out that I think
it's really really important to have had

605
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:43,950
an ex back

606
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,229
the people on stage smalls million way
actions along

607
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:52,680
heart Smith along history of different
have to back and really really important

608
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,940
to be proficient in this particular
space I think it's really important

609
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,799
least have some basic running back

610
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:01,589
be able to automate simple tasks really
important in this role

611
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:04,960
it's a long time basic from yours with
the application

612
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,559
thanks to the application security cam
be from rising report is to be where

613
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,910
things are happening but certainly it's
very low hanging fruit for attackers

614
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:16,609
the idea our bridges are potentially
activity break into organization

615
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:20,450
am surely having a cross-platform
experience is fairly important

616
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:25,419
be able to be proficient with both is
really good one or the other sorry guys

617
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,229

people use on me tasks I am

618
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,640
having back in addition every trip
Shinya for when you go and spend time on

619
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,019
trying to break each ID systems are
betting systems

620
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:38,089
billion for near as well as other areas
are coming to market

621
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:41,900
of ideas such am having have a hottie

622
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,559
I N and Josh were packed on an earlier
than once we got a stop to that was

623
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,950
great I work

624
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,130
use to work with Josh I'm she's his

625
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,479
his hobby is one of his passions Rights
official recognition CCTV that's what a

626
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:54,900
space

627
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,640
I was great to have a an area of
expertise that might use later in life

628
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,150
that you're

629
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,849
strategy to expand side it sensible
shoes a pastime

630
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:06,690
and as a pass on to teach her that he
said that all the action from the puter

631
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,130
and then I sent from the computer his
most famous prior that's in space

632
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,279
I'm all members of the team right
certainly is an integrity issue

633
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:19,029
you know I i've many times had really
trust my life for people

634
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:23,089
men at the same time it's really really
important so is no question relative to

635
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:23,640
your team

636
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,029
your community that is going to be there
to support you and today you have to

637
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:30,150
have that trust because it's really
important so

638
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:37,150
whether who come comes as an alter ego
is good to have

639
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:43,349
what that is I was leaving an off-beat
from last I sent a military

640
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:46,680
exactly him a reporter's

641
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,788
wonderful so so well

642
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,329
against the seat so you wanna yes you
are a team another ex was coming up

643
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,309
I'm see what are 18 rights was good to
have over teams have a pic skin

644
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,390
like Tom protested and they can always
take criticism give Christmas usher in

645
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,930
the day

646
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,279
nobody truly knows every character how
fucking good you are right if you don't

647
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:09,539
wanna sit down and have a conversation
go grab the experts downstairs from the

648
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:10,609
BX person to talk and

649
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:13,759
say hey here's my prom night kinda
worked on this particular solution

650
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:17,650
discover the problem was kinda
cleverness is every everybody I've ever

651
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,969
encountered in this community

652
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:23,140
does that I'm show has his own a desk on
black aka

653
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,339
so it just kinda goes East Coast West
Coast wherever you go

654
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,969
right so the conversation kinda
expensive this really really important

655
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:33,630
advocates not so much the conference is
to taxes in the hallway that typically a

656
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,369
really interesting

657
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:38,900
again good read timbers you haven't
taken it's really important okay

658
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,930
song we r going to try to do it if an
exercise in an attack exercise however

659
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,098
the guys if I'm screen here going we'll
see if you guys so we're gonna do is

660
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:51,890
on between you want enough experts 19 of
32 have to be three guys

661
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,759
for sure issue has become our defenders
should be fun just have one at a time

662
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:57,789
when the budget is such a

663
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:00,789
hearty yet at the TT

664
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:03,900
thats restoration

665
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,279
the attackers are you the next five rows
because next five rows can work together

666
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,170
is those five rays are going to be easy
one two three four five slot

667
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,650
people defend against so these guys
clobbering amongst themselves

668
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,199
and potentially you know take down your
system you try to keep up and running

669
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:23,569
during the environment making trivia
business just happens to run

670
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,058
I am they're gonna you know that because
I have unlimited budget

671
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:30,920
tracker China a tax system that has a
treasure chest behind it you China

672
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,819
defended

673
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:35,749
you have a limited budget transcript
best for you possibly do

674
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:39,329
I'm do today quite interesting so

675
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:44,049
your exercise attack target is there
with a good guys in front of the screen

676
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,559
especially see what ports and
configurations you've done on your

677
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,390
network

678
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,499
so you can actually you may be may
comment as to what and why such things

679
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:51,259
are happening

680
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:54,559
because the other four rows are five
rows behind you if they can see the

681
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,609
screen agencies in the detail stuff

682
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:00,839
I'm we were looking at here is trying to
attack the singer is organization to get

683
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,940
to their prosecute remember to affect
their business

684
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,210
so this is Curtis Universe India
national laps on this is an exercise

685
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,690
routine exercise its

686
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,989
done as part of a training course I'm
and what we're looking at here is kinda

687
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:16,869
it's conversation attack and defend so
we've kinda walk through a process that

688
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:18,049
spoke about

689
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:21,960
exercising and questions on how to get
naked people pick outside the box a

690
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,839
little bit

691
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,440
something and then be able to take that
information apply to write serious most

692
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:27,949
this year

693
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:31,369
sure most guys here yes raise your hand
if you guys were community industry

694
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,440
most every never finished so

695
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,789
they produce every day so from the
defenders perspective

696
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:41,559
you know used in her to the network in a
fire in the company the hardy three guys

697
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,759
in hey your response for being so you
have when the documentation

698
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:47,930
people really don't know where things
are I'm yes probably

699
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,160
most people's life in the shop arm
people behind you they have

700
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,719
had the same analysis because they don't
have any information at all

701
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,940
but they're gonna start their attacking
have a different way so you three guys

702
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,279
looking at that environment

703
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:03,749
big keep this in mind your goal here is
to protect the process control system

704
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:07,849
you do not want to allow process control
system to go down

705
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:11,839
and what I mean by that is it could be
you know our gas it could be controlling

706
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,308
had this is a it's a

707
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:16,380
how this exercise guys in a bit not I'm

708
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,479
and the guys behind you gonna listen to
you near listen to your 3 comments

709
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:24,140
you improve this environmental looking
at the port and then they're gonna throw

710
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,150
five

711
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,910
comments at you because they've had more
time to analyze the same problem

712
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,839
stupid how it works so gas in the first
round of

713
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,969
skippers can see the ports is even
clearer slow I had hand ask president

714
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:40,559
arrives I partners

715
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,949
so so I'll have kinda kinda give some
people some narrative hear from the left

716
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:44,440
to the right

717
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,890
and people about my apologies in advance
so from the left to the right we are

718
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:52,969
public facing internet systems erotica
such a review the HSRP as a friend right

719
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:57,049
their time back into a another
public-facing switch

720
00:41:57,049 --> 00:42:00,960
okay but then go to set a redundant
files are in active active mode

721
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,739
I'm these these public facing firewalls
you know they're going to do the

722
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,519
following: redevelopment any TCP to ATT
CP in DMZ

723
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,589
which is Mia whenever on there also
commit to 11 22 33 N

724
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:17,890
your 22 to anything over 4760

725
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,180
I'm again it's really really hard guys
without the handouts iPod as

726
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,698
gonna be as fun as I thought I was gonna
be up and out but the concept fears is

727
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:26,069
that

728
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:29,099
departmental zation the network is
fairly interesting

729
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:33,099
I'm on the DMZ sign you have systems
that manage Medicaid back to the

730
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:34,249
corporate network

731
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:37,849
into corporate networks idea of systems
that can communicate outbound

732
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:42,619
with very limited controls right because
again be some files you may be able to

733
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:43,719
see

734
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,480
on on the process control network you
have systems there that have talked the

735
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,929
systems in the corporate network

736
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:52,989
and vice versa beast on their own their
role you have systems that are named for

737
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,309
naming standard

738
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:57,989
which is fairly unified a uniform to
school you know where organizations

739
00:42:57,989 --> 00:42:59,949
police are assets

740
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:02,670
and you three days after a missile ship
it was fun because you have probably a

741
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,509
Cisco guy

742
00:43:03,509 --> 00:43:07,309
prior network I I got Parnell sky
whenever

743
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:10,619
you three guys gonna run shown fun so
finish in a

744
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:14,749
sure observation here if I was to attack
you

745
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:18,380
from the inside what would be something

746
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,400
that you would potentially wanna change

747
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,829
fairly quickly Gatka

748
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:29,420
K good Marmora masses from the outside
because you choose to turn off the

749
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,150
attack from the inside

750
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,599
ken protest protocols good

751
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,809
good to see you again we have notch on
the ports and have them have them out

752
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:42,670
your 23 in FTP a center that are going
to be clear text protocols we want to

753
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,869
ensure that those systems are

754
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:47,179
maybe not gonna be fair tax in the ass
before we have you

755
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:52,640
attacked

756
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,839
any any girls in the printer and you
have work stations act and talk to each

757
00:43:56,839 --> 00:43:57,380
other

758
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,599
writing the unified communication and
again all servicemen talk to anybody

759
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,509
during a limitation of the land
something suffering the environment

760
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,759
comes quite interesting

761
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:10,429
right so now guys as usual thing about a
Fisher environment

762
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:14,079
row two three four and five get

763
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,960
attack what's the first thing you do
kidnap or the absence

764
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,619
like this guy so easily go potentially
2012 at his house trying to fish

765
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,670
befriend him transformation Adam maybe
I'll still with the placard pans

766
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,039
but message so his urges a good
questions how to get that employs

767
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,699
address

768
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:36,809
Facebook play

769
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:40,440
forged national the enemy

770
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,859
so so you can you try to protect the
human assets in your organization as

771
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,759
well from the attacker 0345 any

772
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:50,039
the quick comment as to me century as an
inside attacker had 10 tackles

773
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:51,279
organization

774
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:58,279
you have physical access

775
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:01,809
good point say once maybe fish the
interest in rhyme with now wheres that

776
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,109
the organization pretty much a tax %uh
from the inside the DOS environment

777
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:09,009
knocking over how to do it prior from
phishing attacks are

778
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:12,420
am so as you go through these scenarios
here this is

779
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,920
another example it's a little more
extensive guys with the handout

780
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,819
and we have 10 minutes cool I'm so I
partisan advance the slides will be

781
00:45:19,819 --> 00:45:21,690
available I do highly recommend

782
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,370
you check out a

783
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,410
national edge exercise that's well
documented something really

784
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:29,899
useful to do tabletop within your own
organization heavens are thinking

785
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,770
outside the box you really should
potentially

786
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,130
start looking at you attackers
perspective I'm

787
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,260
this visualization I am is showing a tax
perspective rack so

788
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,140
from the outside in be able to pop up
box break David hit other systems from

789
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,430
within the environment based on the rule
sets that are there

790
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,430
within the organization to be quite
scary ratso

791
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:51,910
muscle don't think 34 your Ford systems
down line

792
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,170
but it's really important national
visualization to show someone you know

793
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:55,420
it

794
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,000
when this box was broken here's what I
did: I'm so it goes from there

795
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,190
there's a few methodology think that are
worth mentioning

796
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,860
I am against in a bombing are I'm the
first one is the IATA RP

797
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,820
so you may remember this is the NSA I am
I E M has been changed as national

798
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,550
security issues not want to name a
socially with

799
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:16,140
this particular I'm training or
certification for everything

800
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,680
I'm so I ATRP is the new one much comes
up

801
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,520
the duets for your describing the best
IEEE 1471

802
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,640
is now even have study %uh engineering
systems

803
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,009
that are useful and conducting a routine
exercise on dynamic system systems

804
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,670
system designed as a truck I'm a little
more on the

805
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,460
when the system design space than the
attack and brakes on space

806
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,350
IEEE 1471 should be reviewed again

807
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:49,080
sandia has a I dark on their team is

808
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,160
have been very proficient in protecting
our nuclear power plants here in the US

809
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,720
so far surgeon today they've done some
good work

810
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,650
popular hers are as I mentioned earlier
has on Yas them us is pretty awesome

811
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,710
I really impressed with the work at
Peets put in their blood sweat and tears

812
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,510
hasn't allowed traction here in the US
quite frankly that's unfortunate cabinet

813
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,340
has done a really good job of getting
out there in space in Europe and other

814
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,300
countries sauce is well worth checking
out I'm the Los testing guide is really

815
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:13,750
cool

816
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,420
if you want a break when applications
I'm on fun

817
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,790
and certainly the nest standards for
network testing such her feel useful so

818
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,009
if you're looking for something to do
it's not really the bank ways to a

819
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,360
widget tall

820
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,270
thats after this week for the new
exploit that just came out the other

821
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,130
like you're compiling want to cancel
your friends

822
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,220
I'm that's cool but it's kinda like that

823
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,050
that you love if you don't understand
the methodology and approach in order to

824
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,160
accomplish a goal

825
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,200
its the vs Lee Adams are gonna be kinda
difficult to plug into the conversation

826
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,730
so we're trying to defend against the
attacker if you are the defender

827
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:51,190
or after the attacker hopefully within
your own water a scope

828
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,430
I'm that these these methodological help
you

829
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,529
in addition these methods are also a
razor blade

830
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,270
because his razor blades are actually
being used today by

831
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,680
by organizations and individuals on that
are attacking systems

832
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,129
why they work near Philly profession I'm
so

833
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,520
they're no longer secrets s2 happy
operate I'm

834
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,470
how I gotta go back to WikiLeaks then
check the video in the ass because I

835
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,110
could

836
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,030
all I can say is that if you don't walk
behind a report every portion yet behind

837
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,290
to insurgents are 3 answers into a
building with gun slept over there

838
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:28,340
their hand over their shoulders on you
probably get lit up

839
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,700
in addition to that you have your clear
communication I was go back to their

840
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,190
CEOs and basically saying here's a
receipt is a receipt we have clearance

841
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:36,900
to go in

842
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,460
business major national video on the
next one he was not found surge into a

843
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:40,920
house

844
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,390
but attended today on it was the
disclosure

845
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,240
not the video was the disclosure in that
scenario that was the issue I think was

846
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,360
the disclosure that it was a from the
fireside from the fire problem

847
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,600
opposed to a a and search mission we've
got a lot

848
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,970
I'm so inclusion there's a lot of
organizations that really need your help

849
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:03,020
right various threats again I work with
a loss but a lot with those guys

850
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,830
I'll still a lot with organization for
go to such a

851
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,520
if you're looking to deployment
organization there the place you should

852
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,370
probably start

853
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:15,390
because these organizations help you to
connect with the people that are hiring

854
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,180
any spaces

855
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,629
or if you're ready in a comfortable
setting you should probably look

856
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,900
as resources these are really important
times

857
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,300
I'm have a positive impact on secure
critical systems and infrastructures

858
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,120
fairly important

859
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,870
I would like to think that the
parachutes there in this room for now

860
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,560
connected

861
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,990
should be as a result some reaction to
its guidance I'm

862
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:37,190
it always have to work with high-energy
lighthearted and unique people

863
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:41,490
I am so many times I've had to go
outside my circle to find expert South

864
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,760
America in a particular area are so many
of them

865
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,250
here including Steve St are so so so
it's

866
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:51,250
yes exactly so it's nice to work with
folks that bring various backgrounds to

867
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:51,720
the table

868
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,880
going beers which is good position
places such powerful systems

869
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,060
that's kinda fun all but it's really
cool to also get paid to bed without

870
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,810
going to jail

871
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,020
on about you but I'm a big fan of bob is
as

872
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:07,960
as Josh woods soak up a quick read it
and we offer any questions much has gone

873
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,540
up on the panel here if you a little

874
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,029
be able to to be secretary back very
quickly for side to give you a nice is

875
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:18,110
Frank orkut shut out for us from their
back from help you with absecon

876
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,720
we do Sandia National Labs for some
other work to be done here

877
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,180
a partisan I work with Chris trying to
loot for tire chain for the video

878
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,859
provide security time line and/or UK
Robin sage

879
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,300
sammich average for the grill a video
that you've seen and even emmanuel

880
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,280
goldstein

881
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,400
or acrylic so we really appreciate him
helping out

882
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,480
as well and mentor for the reviews on
the slide decks

883
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,040
I'm so if or any questions it's kinda
high level talks as i understand that

884
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,750
koppel we would certainly be happy to do
our best to ask

885
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,070
or answer any question last five minutes
that we have said we have any questions

886
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:51,770
from the audience

887
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,810
about pretty mean tactics parents sir

888
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,140
are there recognize professional
organizations that such companies or

889
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,870
individuals can join

890
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:08,589
so Inc all anyone coming up

891
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:12,110
close to mention to Austin for guard
those professional

892
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,140
organizations that deal with in Scopus
pace

893
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,609
definitely worth a look-see especially
oh i spose

894
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:24,050
acres a wasp first rounds on a law
special meeting

895
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:29,300
your free beer after you talk about
hacking sense to me

896
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:33,350
so so I would ask a question like this I
i'm probably where about 35 teams around

897
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:34,270
the world that do

898
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,490
that paperwork and they are different
provisions is

899
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,900
on many remit many team subscribe to
different organizations OWASP in other

900
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,630
places well to be a part of it

901
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:47,540
I'm you have other profession
information skip in SICU

902
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,660
I see it they're kinda in that space
number really depends with disappoint us

903
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,899
writes off your caps X focus sort of an
organization

904
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,470
then you have one particular group of
guys in its kinda mishmash

905
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:01,640
forces not red team Association dot com

906
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,480
business today search Prime Minister

907
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,550
cough next how do you defend your

908
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,590
your people against money

909
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,610
booze sacks arm or

910
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:19,650
sort of having their arm twisted
kidnapping a family member

911
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,720
and then use in the back into work to do
your bidding

912
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,140
so right William wants their first and
you can

913
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,270
then you can answer your give tom is a

914
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:34,840
and I was gonna go with this one sites I
just I just came back from Mexico

915
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,180
and not as prescribed place for Franklin
and I want things I

916
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,300
found on my doorstep I walked down to
the whole time in the morning was a

917

body parts on the body parts that were
transitory don't speak Spanish was that

919
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,350
in new places a new police chief was
sworn in US English song in Spanish for

920
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:55,460
some strange reason has it the US papers

921
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,760
Copper Basin definitely schieffer sworn
in 16 hours after he was sworn he was

922
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,880

was dragged out

925
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:13,830
he was taken and 12-14 hours later his
body parts were found around the printer

926
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,950
what he represented and on his body
parts was prime

927
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,040
effort I meant that Norco the narcotics
industry fewer

928
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,090
on Norco as a consortium this week on
the territory for rios

929
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,380
want to have the the police chief sorry
real

930
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,400
big might face a similar fate such count
1 part 2 also while there

931
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,540
I'm interesting article actually hit the
paper and I was

932
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,620
told it to be true as well was a 37
insurance companies in mexico

933
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,810
in a particular region they're all
invited 28

934
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:44,310
might best for a education about doing

935
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,570
am more insurance stuff

936
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,820
and he said Carsten various
organizations picking on people for

937
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,050
about 140 people

938
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,210
from all these different runs companies
I'm

939
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:59,420
and what they did was they did a few
presentations and the new lock the doors

940
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,010
they told a ring around the beginning
today usurping as ten thousand dollars

941
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,780
US because we're doing your data

942
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,300
and we do a slighter prove it was
basically showing that they

943
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,490
knocked in two people in OCT into people
have asked backup tapes

944
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,520
insight into the organization's message
to repay us

945
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,180
the damage your gonna face as a result
of your your business

946
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,190
so to answer your question how do you
defend against it

947
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,650
its quite difficult because without
comment was Asian

948
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:29,190
as well as trust within the business
it's quite difficult to get anything

949
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,510
done right

950
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,640

955
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,049
