makes it makes you happy arm well this
is the

10
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,440
the Saturday keynote and might say
something about the

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,900
when I first met julius on shove
WikiLeaks

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,079
it was some shortly after the video

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,120
Collateral Murder was released for the
all seeing that video

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,960
it has a some video of a US troops guys
are not very nice things that

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,860
allegedly they never did before are the
video was actually reveal

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,379
up wikiLeaks is an organization that

17
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,849
other accepts leaks from people all over
the planet

18
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:09,649
and when appropriate publishes them so
that the world can see

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,119
and I have to think that something
that's extremely important something

20
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,460
that the hacker world

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,259
realizes is is a valuable part of a
democratic society

22
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,490
and I think that the the person who
leaked the video

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:29,490
in the first place to WikiLeaks should
be considered a national hero

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,380
so the time that I met Julie in the
video has just been released we had a

25
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,509
one off the hook

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,590
and the it was incredible um

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,510
a situation where we were talk to the
person who had received the video

28
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,790
released to the world of course was the
focal point of attention

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,950
even though he was in the country he
felt safe releasing

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,380
that video there because of all the
press attention then

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,929
a month or so later I i met up with him
again

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,940
are and said basically I show is more
recent than that was it

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,010
a few days later I'll we talked about
having him give the keynote address here

34
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,260
at Hope I said you know this

35
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,570
this will be a receptive crowd these
these will be people who understand what

36
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,470
it is you're doing it with the leaks and
we'll see the importance of it

37
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,109
and will make big contributions to the
Wikileaks cable which is downstairs

38
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,800
right now

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,170
and honor what the work you do is fight
oh it's important it must be encourage

40
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,730
and people who contribute things like
this I

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,450
need to know that there is a safe place
for them to actually

42
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,549
I give their sensitive material that can
be used for the greater good

43
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:46,780
and if you if ya know %uh no source has
ever been revealed

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,730
via WikiLeaks however there are other
ways a revealing

45
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,510
potential sources through the mass media

46
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,010
and through other means little while
later

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,109
month or so later there is an article
that appeared in the

48
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,870
one of my favorite online magazines
wired of

49
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,150
yes are sarcastic are

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,110
and %uh that particular article are was
about the

51
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,950
somebody in the community at that the
alleged

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,430
leaker out this video the site the
contact thinking that he was a kindred

53
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,190
spirit

54
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,690
and as happens in the hacker world
sometimes

55
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,910
people don't know when to shut up so he
told this person a lot of things

56
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,590
about that the video about that I think
260,000 classified documents that he was

57
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,310
also

58
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,420
leaking to WikiLeaks and this person

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,319
I wipe it or personal quote for the some
love you may

60
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,550
may know why but the hit this this
person %uh

61
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,150
decided that that that was a bit much
and I went to the authorities

62
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,760
and as a result the person who allegedly
leaked all this information is currently

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,609
in custody in kuwait

64
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,970
and at that moment

65
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,489
Juliana science became a very

66
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,680
wanted man in this country we've been
able to verify this ourselves

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,829
are as as true that the authorities

68
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,450
really really want to question him about
the documents that he is getting from

69
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,539
this source from other sources

70
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,469
about this what it is he's doing in the
first place that Julian is

71
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,830
is is committed to what he does just
like any %uh view

72
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,800
who work late at night on your various
projects and to address to the world

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,990
thinks you're crazy and wasting your
time

74
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,820
this is another version of that and
Julian is a is one of the most %uh

75
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,979
driven and dedicated people I've ever
met

76
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,729
ISO that is why we week we asked the
keynote here and that is why

77
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:54,940
I he was some particularly interested in
making sure that

78
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,800
that commitment was not the was not lost
at the

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,750
the address to you would be given I
regardless of the fact that we were able

80
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,490
to

81
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,780
verified with our federal contacts that
if he were to set foot

82
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,430
in this country he would be immediately
detained

83
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,770
now i with all that said how many view
expect to see Julian walk through that

84
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,950
side or right now

85
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:25,950
I come by this stage yeah and how many
have you live in the real world

86
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,940
unfortunately we all do

87
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,409
there is a week the leaks presentation
today

88
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,630
there is a weekly weeks keynote address
without further ado

89
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:47,630
are like to introduce WikiLeaks

90
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,229
put all my friends and fans and domestic
and

91
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,849
international surveillance for

92
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:14,099
I'm here today because I believe that we
can make a better world

93
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,938
Julian unfortunately can't make it

94
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,519
because we don't live in that better
world right now because we haven't yet

95
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,159
made it

96
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:26,709
I want to make a little declaration for
the federal agents that are standing in

97
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:27,659
the back of the room

98
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,479
and the ones that are sending in the
front of the room and to be very clear

99
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,089
about this

100
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,599
I have on me in my pocket some money

101
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,649
the Bill of Rights a driver's license
and that's it

102
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,819
I have no computer system have no
telephone I have no keys no access to

103
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,399
anything

104
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,519
there's absolutely no reason that you
should arrest me or bother me

105
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,729
and just in case you're wondering

106
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,360
an American born and raised Chris
unhappy

107
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm happy with how things are going

108
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,490
I've dedicated my life to helping

109
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,370
other people who need help in general
and specifically I work with human

110
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,460
rights activists

111
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,340
I work with people who care about a
woman's right to choose

112
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,700
the ability to freely vote I work with
people who are working for some kind of

113
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,930
social change that is positive in this
world

114
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,600
this is extremely important to me and
they don't expect told you to do this as

115
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,060
well

116
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,270
but expect you to support me and I
expect you to support

117
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,150
the activities to take place better in
support of these things

118
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:43,150
to quote from Tron I fight for the user

119
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,810
I've done some other things

120
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,250
they're not really that important but
they're in line with what I believe

121
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,690
wikiLeaks is in line with

122
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,390
I want to teach people I want people to
learn I want them to collaborate

123
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:59,930
I want them to cooperate and I want them
to be able to speak freely without fear

124
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,950
retribution

125
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,039
that's why we're kinda nice bridge and
that's why we're cunt or

126
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,970
I think that if you can you should
organize should organize locally in

127
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,710
order to make things like this possible

128
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,920
you should help people in whatever way
that is possible

129
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,440
you should also read free software

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,910
if you have the opportunity because it
is only then that people will be able to

131
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,860
trust what you do

132
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,610
there are people whose lives depend on
suffer the hacker community rights

133
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,820
its kinda scary thing to think that
considering some of the quality

134
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
but in general it's extremely important

135
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,250
so you should consider the fact that
it's not just about politics

136
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,150
and I am here speaking on behalf

137
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,209
WikiLeaks and I'm here said

138
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,320
representative the Tor project room for
his way

139
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,430
I'm sure that they probably would not be
too unhappy with me speaking a right now

140
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,460
but they certainly didn't know about it
before this moment so

141
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,670
I believe that we are complicit in
crimes against humanity when we

142
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,790
know about them we don't stop them I
think that it is quite clear to me

143
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,800
that every single person in this room
has in some way contributed to the war

144
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,510
in Iraq in the war in Afghanistan

145
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,400
and I wonder how you will feel about
knowing that you were the one its

146
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,890
I am the one that is funded every bullet
that shot a child

147
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,780
and every woman who has to come home to
a family

148
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,010
it has been decimated by troops where
there is no justice

149
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,230
where people don't have recourse any
kind whatsoever

150
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,320
where the standard operating procedures
for someone to take a .50-caliber

151
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,480
machine gun and shoot across the engine
block and killed the driver

152
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,670
I'm not sure that that's the world I
want to live there

153
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,229
and I'm not sure that that's the world I
wanna funk I'm pretty sure it's not

154
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,160
about you guys what do you think is that
what you want that's good

155
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,160
so what are you doing to change it

156
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,649
I guess it depends if you're a brent
sadler

157
00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:00,079
I grew up listening to how terrible
things were in the world before

158
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,529
and the new conservative lie and it is a
lie is that when the Berlin Wall fell

159
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:08,390
history ended we're in a new world of
prosperity

160
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,699
no problems anymore but actually that's
not the case

161
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,750
we all live in a mythology and the
mythology that we're living in is that

162
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,240
America does no harm

163
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,959
and that is simply not true I believe
that in general americans are very good

164
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,550
and they want to do the right thing

165
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,380
and I think that's why not have your
rushing the stage and trying to hurt me

166
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,000
right now

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,630
but we condemn the past

168
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,950
well funding the future every would
condemn if it were passed

169
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,959
it doesn't really make sense so

170
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,490
I want a quote from one of my personal
heroes I was gonna give you a quote from

171
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,290
my friend daniel ellsberg but I think
that much the Marlins bike fits with

172
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,370
this crowd a little more

173
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,750
right is a fantastic fellow and he
really is inspired

174
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,100
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't
for him he helped me to engage with the

175
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,300
world in a way that I couldn't
previously understand

176
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,620
and this is what about the truth has
helped you and I always given countless

177
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,420
examples

178
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,329
and so what i want. to hear from people
is on a regular basis

179
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,170
how the truth has helped them we have to
dismiss with the cynicism

180
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,349
sincerity is the new black so tell me

181
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,430
has the truth helped you right about
this

182
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,269
publish it tell people how it has helped
you show

183
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,959
that when you learn new things that they
have affected you in some way

184
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,279
and that you have affected other people
that some good ripples out in your

185
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,360
network as a result

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,820
knowing things this is extremely
important considering the fact that we

187
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,430
teach you things we tell you things that
we give you documents

188
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,529
we need people to do analysis on those
documents

189
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,430
see you guys can be the ones they can
actually say how truth has helped you

190
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,160
and I'll tell you why there are some
people

191
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,620
I would say the hacker community that
quite simply just don't believe this

192
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,279
statement

193
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,209
but this is from the winner of the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1970

194
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:02,290
he says and mankind soul salvation lies
and everyone making

195
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,810
everything is business in the people
love the East being vitally concerned

196
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,819
with what is thought

197
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:10,279
in the West the people at the West
vitally concerned with what goes on in

198
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,920
the east

199
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,240
that is our job when you ignore the
injustices that the world

200
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,810
you are part of the problem there's no
question about that

201
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,050
and it is certainly the case that when
you fund it you are the problem

202
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,790
so here's the solution

203
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,209
my friends and I have come up with
certainly not my idea

204
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,750
but I'm on board a hundred percent we
believe

205
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,339
that is absolutely necessary to accept
documents that are relevant

206
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,310
relevant because they're classified
censored or otherwise restricted

207
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,980
this is extremely important because this
is the type of material

208
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,319
that is going to be able to make the
most amount of change

209
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,729
when it is accepted to us we have a
pretty strong vetting process

210
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,010
part of this and what makes it safe for
people to use this

211
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,569
is that we have very strong support for
anonymity where uncensored

212
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:08,790
you can try to take us down but for
those of you that have read the mentor

213
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,660
and what he's had to say about hackers
you know that you can stop us there's

214
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,260
just more

215
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,550
us and the important thing is that we
actually use the rule of law

216
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,300
the rule of law is actually despite my
anarchist tendencies

217
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,100
very important it is protection in the
press that allows me to be here right

218
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,589
now

219
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,019
and it allows Julian to travel freely
throughout the world because people

220
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,870
would like to shoot the messenger

221
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,990
there is no question about this we
believe that

222
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,380
we are not the only game in town but for

223
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,750
we believe that we are specifically a
functional whistleblowing platform

224
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,010
that is useful for people with the
promises that we

225
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,769
have made we think that other people
might shine in important ways

226
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,370
but we have a very specific set of goals
which is to make a giant impact

227
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,449
the purpose of this is not profit you
can't change the world if you're setting

228
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,220
out to make a profit all the time

229
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,800
the benefit has to be a cooperative 1
it's absolutely important to not think

230
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,260
this is a competitive

231
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,819
singer any kind and this promise

232
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:17,079
that we make about it being a public
service sometimes I think people might

233
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:17,990
criticize

234
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,760
for example that we took down the site
for a period of time for some reaction

235
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,500
here

236
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,360
and when we asked for donations but
there's no question that these documents

237
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,630
will always be available

238
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,420
and of course we plan to release a lot
more

239
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,930
the purpose of releasing this is that we
think that special access is probably

240
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,699
not the way that we can make a free and
democratic society

241
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:46,620
realized throughout the entire planet we
think that it's absolutely important

242
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,180
that you don't have to be someone
special to verify something

243
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,730
or to get information think about it
this way

244
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,079
how can you trust the media when the
media does not behave like scientific

245
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:57,939
paper

246
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,240
how do you know for that when someone
tells you something

247
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,180
that is true if you don't unless you
have the original fax

248
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,740
and so that's the purpose of this to
give you the original fax

249
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,500
of course there will be interpretations
of course there will be people to do

250
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,930
analysis on this

251
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,850
but the purpose here is to give you the
facts so you can draw your own

252
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,730
conclusions

253
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,949
to give you the data so that you have
the ability to make your own analysis

254
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:25,949
and specifically and most importantly

255
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:29,809
we are going to back down when the
media's Gackt

256
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,850
we refuse to be taxed we refuse to be
silent

257
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:39,850
there is no reason absolutely

258
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,220
there is no reason whatsoever that we
should back down here

259
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,579
and we refuse to do so simply because

260
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:55,940
you cannot erase the past these things
that have transpired must be no

261
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,199
and the mere fact that people fight to
race the past

262
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,670
as if it has not happened should be
quite an indicator of something being

263
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,160
very very wrong

264
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,600
not just for this country but with every
country in the world that attempts to do

265
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,089
this

266
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,920
and so we have a history of doing this

267
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,620
let me explain how it works we have a
pretty good process

268
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,380
we like to say that we have around a
thousand people involved

269
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,630
there's a a lot of people involved there
are a lot of people here right now that

270
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,089
support us in various ways and thank you
for that

271
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:32,259
you know who you are and I don't know
here thank you for that

272
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:39,259
also for some of the people that work

273
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,360
with us are so well educated so
fantastic

274
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,380
so magical and what they have done I
really can't thank him enough for doing

275
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,550
something that is really important which
is not giving up

276
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,980
and following your dreams we need people

277
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,230
that are highly educated in every walk
of life it is extremely important not

278
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,350
just to be a technologist for today
candy

279
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,750
but for example we need people they can
tell us

280
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,530
I can help us mean there's some pretty
good hackers involved we have a good

281
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,829
idea about photography and anonymity and
privacy and security

282
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,829
but it's always good to have another set
of eyes so it's extremely important

283
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,829
to continue to do things with your life
that you think that you should do

284
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,589
and then when you have the skills when
you have the desire

285
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,250
and you can help us and you can help
yourself to because that's what happens

286
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,230
when you help us

287
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:35,230
we will help everyone this is a point of
some contention but it should be

288
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,520
our process has never lost a source it's
very clear

289
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,539
that we have not taken down a
publication we have never then

290
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,679
force in a lawsuit to take out a
publication

291
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,929
and we haven't lost the server and
myself I find to be quite surprising

292
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:57,330
but we have it and we're changing the
world

293
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,449
thank you for helping us with their so

294
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,780
Julia likes to say that the goal is
justice and that the method is

295
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,690
transparency

296
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,940
I think that we're meeting our goals and
I think that we are

297
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,220
using transparency in a really strong
way

298
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,650
see it's extremely important to remember
that what we're doing is not subversive

299
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,980
unless the things that we are subverting
are actively trying to harm us

300
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,390
unless they are being deceptive the idea
that when we legal document or when we

301
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,330
do is think

302
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,899
that somehow we are back at

303
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,350
that is absolutely impossible

304
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,809
because it is these in is these
individuals organizations and

305
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,830
governments that wish to suppress
information

306
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,210
from you so when you're talking about
how some information might be worth

307
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,419
fighting and maybe they're sometimes
that

308
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:51,280
some secret should be kept remember what
you're saying is that someone else is

309
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,690
more qualified to make a decision that
your

310
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,840
this is an extremely anti-democratic
thought process

311
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,840
you should rejected

312
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,570
our goal this time ask the truth

313
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,530
prayer I think that this is the most
important point that we can make share

314
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,980
we aren't here to simply tell you some
four-ship

315
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,590
we're here to tell you things that
people are actively trying to keep

316
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,240
secret

317
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,610
we don't care if you're a Republican or
Democrat

318
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,620
or libertarian it is relevant there are
things that are so much bigger than

319
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,950
partisan politics

320
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,240
human lives are much more important than
partisan politics

321
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,100
and it is important to remember that
we're not here

322
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,390
to solve these problems fight siding
with one person

323
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,060
but rather to reach every person on all
sides

324
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,510
to reach deep down inside of themselves
so that they can

325
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:57,510
very easily know what the right thing to
do it's

326
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,610
Peter says that we can easily forgive a
child who's afraid of the dark

327
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,660
the real tragedy of life is when men are
afraid of the light so I asked you

328
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,190
are you all afraid of the light for

329
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,710
I didn't hear a refund if it's a little
surprising is there a little fear

330
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,160
in the audience here for

331
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,350
good that's what I want to hear does
anyone here believe that they don't have

332
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,510
a right to know

333
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:35,510
what's going on come on now this is a
thought exercise the purpose is to get

334
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,280
you to think

335
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,240
and then to answer the question
fantastic

336
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,410
do you all want to know what's going on
with WikiLeaks I

337
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,660
guess he thought about that for a while
so

338
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,610
here's an important thing I think a lot
of anti-authoritarian types like to

339
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,420
think that speaking truth to power is
good you know your stick it to the man

340
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,390
you show them and how it iz well

341
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,810
I think that stupid power no its power

342
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,200
because powers in power to what you need
to do is empower yourself

343
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,690
you need to know that it is important to
take this power and give it to people

344
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,760
that are not

345
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,300
simply the people that make decisions

346
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,530
give it to the people that vote than an
out of office

347
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,560
that's why we want to inform everyone
about this

348
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,530
this is why we want to make sure the
people that are empowered

349
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,600
know that they cannot issue a denial
when everyone knows the truth

350
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,260
they can't redacted document when
everyone Rd has a copy of it in their

351
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,700
heart

352
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,930
in their mind this is something that I
think that I love you understand their

353
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,790
and so I hope that I love you will take
something away from this and do

354
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,700
something about it

355
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,830
some EDS had some things to say about
WikiLeaks

356
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,710
order through that real quick I think
that it's pretty clear

357
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,470
that we've done some good work I like
this one hour

358
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,720
should hide it doesn't ask for next to

359
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,190
your list the show internally developed
that's a bold statement

360
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,570
and the Germans don't make bold
statements like that unless they're

361
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,490
pretty serious

362
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:11,670
fish

363
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,010
this right here some awards that I would
say that julian has pretty clearly

364
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,030
one and accepted for the project

365
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,129
but it's important to remember that
wikiLeaks is not just Julia

366
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,270
so this whole idea funding for him you
can cut off the head

367
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,720
but there will be more you just can't
stop us

368
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,380
so here's an example of WikiLeaks at
work for playback

369
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,780
there's essentially this problem
especially in the United Kingdom

370
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,770
which is that people like to not only
pretend that they can erase the past

371
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,230
but they try to take the present and
pretend that it

372
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,740
isn't happening they censor publications
and

373
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,790
the fight against what is actually
happening in this exact moment being

374
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,750
able to be reported in any context what
so ever

375
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,550
so what we do we publish the documents
that they were trying to censor

376
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,129
the internet changes every day take
every tax every person's computer screen

377
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,790
they just don't have that kind of
control

378
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,760
the same is true with this to mention
report

379
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,210
shows that there was toxic waste dumping
where

380
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,940
over a hundred thousand people have been
hospitalized for treatment to seek help

381
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,860
in some way

382
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,420
can you imagine that that every person
in this room and every person you know

383
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,520
probably and this is something that when
people know this

384
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,040
for for to Marx's quote his question

385
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,250
but people know this they can get out of
there

386
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,160
and they can seek help and they can seek
to address their concerns in a very

387
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,390
serious way

388
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,670
and so these corporations use major
legal obstacles

389
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,580
in order to make sure that their secret
processes error to make sure that there

390
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,350
are things that are taking place that
you cannot know about that you cannot

391
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,070
talk about that you can't repeat

392
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,990
but you can't quote this is ridiculous

393
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,760
this is not the world that we want to
live there so we can fix published this

394
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,510
document

395
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,260
and we publish those documents so that
people have access to the in an outside

396
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,140
of that country

397
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,290
so that people will be able to no and to
take action

398
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,129
which is what they should do which is
what you should do and there are other

399
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,790
publications which are fantastic like a
BBC

400
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,710
but the fact that matter is is they have
a structure does not allow them to

401
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,710
actually tell you everything that's
going on

402
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,170
they have a lot to lose I don't have
anything to lose

403
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,500
prayer I want to make a better world

404
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,640
that's what Julian wants that's what
Daniel wants that's what other people

405
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,960
logo and name want and it is extremely
important

406
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,160
there we don't let the buck stop with
the publications that are afraid of

407
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,010
losing their

408
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,500
newsroom if we get it out there those
tax

409
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,670
will become irrelevant everyone will
know the information

410
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,780
and I think there's little bit of a full
disclosure debate here

411
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,160
well I think that it's quite clear where
we stand on freon leaks

412
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:09,120
I suppose but we believe that the most
heavily guarded secrets has it says here

413
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,030
for you have the most potential for
reform there are some people that do not

414
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,629
believe this they believe that it is
possible that we should keep the secrets

415
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,220
there

416
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,360
but ask you what is it that the secret
say

417
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,470
is it the idea that if you have
something there someone else would know

418
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,960
and that would cause some kind of harm I
wonder what is it that you were doing

419
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,850
that you are so afraid of

420
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,510
what is the hegemony that you are
promoting in the world

421
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,629
that's the question writer so I believe
that way

422
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,380
people in a democracy know these things

423
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,190
it will cause a change and cause a big
change because when people have things

424
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,630
done in their name

425
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,960
it changes things in their hearts and
that

426
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,330
takes that takes them on a pretty heavy
trip to the ballot box

427
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,090
journalists sometimes do the right thing

428
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,140
and it's a little bit disappointing

429
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,590
there's a video that we're going to talk
about

430
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,620
that a journalist had for quite some
time

431
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,540
and that journalists did not release it
because they feared losing their special

432
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,629
access

433
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,020
you see the military offered a
collaboration

434
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,320
between journalists and the military air
and they said

435
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,450
you can come along for ride with us but
we get to exercise a little editorial

436
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,300
control

437
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,790
and so these journalists did the right
thing and they turned that down

438
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,000
and some of these journalists did the
right thing and base

439
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,210
they talked about what they saw and some
of these journalists

440
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,360
did not do the right thing and they kept
quiet so that they would keep their

441
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,620
access those journalists

442
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,680
are not very good in my opinion

443
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,070
so we believe

444
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,389
the disclosure is the thing that is the
most important

445
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,430
losing access we have access to
everything

446
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,520
because everyone a few is in every
single system

447
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,250
that has all these documents we don't
have to worry about it

448
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,390
when you see something that's wrong you
will tell us

449
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,440
and we will tell the world so that no
one knows

450
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,610
that it was you that helped us and this
is super important

451
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,170
absolutely without question

452
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,360
because at the end of the day this
transparency as well

453
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,590
create change there's little
controversial disclosure

454
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,560
the Warlock system have any of you heard
of this no

455
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,480
okay the IED detection system anyway

456
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,000
this basically says that there are some

457
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,800
I descended blocks them explains how it
works

458
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,450
and by the time that it was disclosed
that is mostly changed

459
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,480
but it's interesting because what it did
is it revealed

460
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,210
essentially that there is so much
information that people

461
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,280
Rd new

462
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,570
that by telling everyone that people
know it

463
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,710
to change things it forced people to
react in a different way

464
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,960
and it just so happened that we had been
spending a majority of our expenses on

465
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,840
these devices

466
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,680
which insurgents had already figured out
how to get around

467
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,480
so this is something really important
it's the idea that there's this black

468
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,420
market for information

469
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,730
and as long as only some people have it

470
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,230
not everyone and things will be alright
in some cases

471
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,860
I guess I could see why someone would
make a reasoning line of reasoning

472
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,060
but it's just not true to people in her
crack know what's going on

473
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,590
right its us we're the ones that don't

474
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,679
I mean it's quite clear that they've
been able to get around a lot of these

475
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,790
jamming devices

476
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,480
so what's important is that when things
don't work but people understand that

477
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,580
they're not working

478
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,870
the military-industrial complex is
extremely large and very convoluted

479
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,460
and it means that there are a lot of
players here for benefit regardless if

480
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,290
the thing saves our troops

481
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,710
that's a really important point correct
and I think it's quite clear that there

482
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,090
are people there

483
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,510
would just like to see this information
vicious that have adapted to change a

484
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:12,140
and I understand their because they're
usually the ones that profit from it

485
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,490
but I say no

486
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,540
so it's important in this case

487
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,800
this transparency I believe is quite
obviously neutral

488
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,390
because now we all know the effort
doesn't have any clothes

489
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,730
this is not bad to know this this is
good to notice

490
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,040
you are now in power to make a decision
about that system

491
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,000
and about the people who might be
protected by that system might try to

492
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,700
thwart that system

493
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,700
now you are as qualified as someone else
to make that decision

494
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,570
if not better because you have the
original source documents on a subject

495
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,710
so let's talk about some other
publishing

496
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:54,590
that we've done that's important Iceland
is a country that is very close

497
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,270
near and dear to my heart and there's a
very

498
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,040
incredible person here from Iceland
we've had long discussions about that

499
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,668
country

500
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,750
and I find it to be quite a special
place

501
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,590
and I had a chance to go to Iceland
earlier this year

502
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,919
it wasn't a secret very kind and we're
working together on a fun project there

503
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,820
I'll talk about that in a moment but the
important thing

504
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,230
is that WikiLeaks their has a special
place

505
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,240
people's hearts because we released

506
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,429
loan books that showed how people have
bankrupted

507
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,890
nation-state how they had essentially

508
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,650
done a ton unethical things and
everybody knows who they are they're

509
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,620
everybody knows what happened and this
is extremely important for a country

510
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,510
that has just over 300,000 people

511
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,510
that is a village by comparison it might
even be

512
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:51,100
Greenwich Village by comparison for

513
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,790
this document is extremely important the
impact that this had on icelandic

514
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,330
society

515
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,490
was not small people understood what
happened they understood that they were

516
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,520
rocked the line

517
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,060
so how has the truth helped how does
that change things

518
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,659
well i think thats quite clear for for
people Iceland

519
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,540
and probably for you let's talk about
Guantanamo Bay

520
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:23,540
you guys probably wanna see that closed
I suppose yeah

521
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,830
let's talk about how we're gonna close
it we're gonna close it

522
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:32,570
by knowing our what's going on there
right

523
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,790
lots of people try to get the operations
manual from Guantanamo Bay

524
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,659
and they quite simply couldn't get it
through the Freedom of Information

525
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,460
act it's just not possible in some cases
to get information

526
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,500
after the document was leaked to us

527
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,410
it was leaked a number of times to us
over some period of time

528
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,050
which shows that every time the US
military told us about how things were

529
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,620
going

530
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,230
and what the procedures were they were
fuckin lying to us

531
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,620
this is really important because you see
this manual was not written

532
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,090
for OCS it was written for people that
do these things

533
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,800
and that's the really important point
here right when you have an internal

534
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,290
document you have a view into the
mindset of the organization

535
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,340
that actually takes these actions

536
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,860
this is critical because when someone
craps a piece of PR for you

537
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,070
it's for you its to effect some changes
to manipulate you to do a thing

538
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,010
right so when you read this document
when you see how the Guantanamo Bay

539
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,280
operations manual was laid out and you
see the operating procedure

540
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,050
you know that it is not something you
want to support

541
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,860
you understand quite clearly

542
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,190
and the fact that multiple times this
document was leaked

543
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,230
let you know that when they said they
made changes in response to media

544
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,169
inquiries

545
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:56,690
you know that they were also why and you
know now when they

546
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,970
with their lips that they're probably
lying again

547
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,120
so how does that change your view that I
suppose you probably still want to be

548
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,330
close down

549
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,330
but you have some facts on your side
here to show that not all the players in

550
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:08,960
the game

551
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,960
are doing the right thing and they're
not on their side to replace them

552
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:20,400
germany has a little bit over fetish
with the military

553
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,540
but say and this is extremely important
because

554
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,100
Germany's military is not supposed to be
going on excursions

555
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,140
it's not supposed to be

556
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,660
having combat people in Germany are not
supported this

557
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,980
and the other a lot go to lie to here
indecent thoughts were

558
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,100
us thanks to

559
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,140
I know Keisha doctor alright so

560
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,480
thanks for the one German

561
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,210
scrape fantastic for

562
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,070
this is important because this this
brings change about Frank this shows

563
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,590
that the politicians that are involved
here

564
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,480
in Germany premier where these types of
things and it doesn't really matter if

565
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,310
they're aware

566
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:08,590
not in some regards because what
actually matters here

567
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,120
is that you know what's actually going
on you've got an idea what Chancellor

568
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,279
Merkel

569
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,730
knows about just a piece probably but
this piece let you know

570
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,449
that maybe things are not going the way
you want them to you

571
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:25,730
wikiLeaks is pretty well known in the
United States for some other things that

572
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,469
have happened recently

573
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,390
and well I think that that's fantastic
it's really important to note

574
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,029
this particularly talked about

575
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,100
around 1700 assassinations essentially

576
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,310
this this this document leak caused
quite a stir in Kenya

577
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,418
really it us the election 2007

578
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,899
and it cause the united nations to do an
investigation

579
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:53,009
effect several people working with
WikiLeaks resuscitated their murdered

580
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,429
for the work that they're doing
different sources they were journalists

581
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,650
they were working to take this
information

582
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,750
and their photos a brutally shot to
death in their car

583
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,850
rare see wanna talk about change when
you expose 1700 people dying

584
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:10,150
there's a chance that you're gonna
you're gonna go to you

585
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,370
it's very unfortunate that that happened
but

586
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,950
their sacrifices made quite a difference
in 10-year

587
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,839
and this is something that I think we
can all learn from which is that we have

588
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,359
to make sacrifices in order to change
the world

589
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,650
we have to make sacrifices that
potentially will cost us our lives

590
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,960
I never expect to work in the computer
security industry again

591
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,910
but that's okay I think this is far more
important than anything like that

592
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,180
and somebody will not make this choice
and that is OK

593
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,980
and some love you will pretend to not
make this choice and you're going deep

594
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:48,980
thank you for that

595
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,309
we don't like to back down from a fight

596
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:00,430
and this is a great example

597
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,720
where some people tried to pull our
demands and

598
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,530
word up for their the did manage to get
some prior restraint polled

599
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,930
but they lost in the end

600
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,500
and the reason they lost this because it
was quite clear that all the information

601
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,359
is out there

602
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,869
we were in the right legally especially
in the United States and we had a San

603
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:19,789
Francisco Court

604
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:24,770
which didn't hurt for you laugh but
there's something to look up to about

605
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,450
that court

606
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:30,480
every court should be like court the
first amendment is extremely clear

607
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,000
this one i think is probably the topic
you all want to hear about

608
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,200
and we are going to talk about it in a
moment as you can see in the upper left

609
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,130
hand corner

610
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,960
I want to be very clear about this video
there were two versions released

611
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,670
it completely unedited version of the
video and a video that has

612
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,160
some commentary it has so subtitles for
people that are

613
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,930
hearing-impaired had for people that are
not able in any way

614
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,680
to be able to for watch the video as it
was intended to be watched

615
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,828
don't take this as

616
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:11,210
editorial commentary that is flipped

617
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,980
we chose the name because it was
important

618
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,349
we chose the name because that is the
language of the people that are

619
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:19,760
committing these crimes

620
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,799
and the sad thing about this video is
that the main reason that and if you

621
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:25,630
know about it

622
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,150
and the only reason that anybody really
cares about its because some journalists

623
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:29,650
died

624
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,140
that's not a knock journalists because
they're definitely one of my favorite

625
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,879
professions

626
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,940
but it's quite clear to me that this is
the type of thing that occurs

627
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,059
every day in Iraq in 2005

628
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,109
I fit right into iraq but say as a
tourist

629
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:49,690
to visit some friends and when I was
there

630
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,630
some love you know the story i'd is it's
a friends that lives in northern Iraq in

631
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,440
kurdistan

632
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,930
our bill asylum in the some of the other
areas on the border

633
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,480
Iran after exiting chartered

634
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,910
the people that I met their arabs from
baghdad especially

635
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,960
horrified to imagine meeting a man

636
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,730
a grown man with tears in his eyes when
he explains that

637
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,980
every day that he leaves his house she
kisses his wife goodbye

638
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,460
and hopes that he will see her day
because he knows that if he takes

639
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,700
the wrong turn on a street that

640
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,119
he gets killed his wife never even gets
to see the body

641
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,740
we're responsible for this

642
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,609
so this video

643
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:40,029
shows an example of that it shows people
trying to do the right thing

644
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:44,180
I ask you if someone invaded your
country and you saw one of your

645
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,419
fellow man or women shot down or other

646
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,740
frankly few southern shot down in the
street

647
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,180
would you stop your car would you have
them

648
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,180
if you saw someone that was brutally

649
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,520
murder heard and somewhere

650
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,670
I think I would it's not my car because
you see

651
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,930
this didn't happen in the middle of
nowhere this happen in the middle other

652
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,868
what is the largest cities in this
country where many many many people if

653
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:15,079
in a neighborhood where normal working
class people

654
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:18,859
live just think about that walk out of
your house

655
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,359
you see someone who's been shot on the
street you try to help for

656
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:26,308
to help them directly to maybe call for
an ambulance such privilege you have to

657
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:27,940
have a telephone that can call

658
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,430
hospital to help them directly

659
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:35,419
because you don't have a choice but this
is an example

660
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,740
where journalists have this video and
that journalists wrote about it in his

661
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,670
book that he sells for a profit

662
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,960
and he did not week the video

663
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,270
do you think that do you think that's
okay

664
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,869
for yet fucking bullshit

665
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:56,960
that's right it's absolutely terrible
and you know what's even worse is that

666
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,109
we support these programs that create
that kind of collaboration

667
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:03,038
between the people that are supposed to
tell the truth and the ones that are

668
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,230
telling lies

669
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:10,040
that is not all right this got a lot of
press

670
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:16,009
somebody probably heard about it we've
done some other things that impress

671
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,970
one of my favorite is it or developer is
the censorship lists

672
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,910
it's really important that people
understand that for example in Australia

673
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,598
the dentist and Australia is potentially
attract

674
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,750
because that's what into for on those
lists

675
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,010
and there are a lot of other things that
you can see on our website

676
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:39,290
so for we did choose a pretty
provocative title

677
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:43,270
Collateral Murder you guys think that's
provocative

678
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,540
there so if you're probably aren't happy
about that rare

679
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,670
no I'm surprised on well

680
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,859
let's be clear we chose that title for
really good reason

681
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:57,290
this is the language of the people that
are doing these things this is

682
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:01,880
without a doubt murder you watched if
you watch this video

683
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,200
more than a dozen people being gunned
down

684
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,029
I mean these are cut small machine guns
for those of you that have shot a

685
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:09,700
machine gun

686
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,400
it's probably better than any machine
ever shot

687
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,819
and it was mounted on a helicopter which

688
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:19,790
her know about you but it works for you
really hard to take down a helicopter

689
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,740
with the camera

690
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,029
this is not the world over we wanna say

691
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:31,440
ride we don't wanna see these things
happening but

692
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,880
we don't want to see these things not
happening by people suppressing the

693
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,339
video

694
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:39,630
we want to change this every single one
of you thinks that it's right that we

695
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,589
are in Iraq

696
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:43,849
needs to remember that you worked
perfectly you specifically are directly

697
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,299
responsible for this

698
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:48,359
and for those of you that art but have
friends

699
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,348
the way that Harvey Milk was so
successful and getting people to stop

700
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:56,650
gay-bashing people was that wasn't too
you know if your day

701
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,210
which I am if your day you come out and
you say

702
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,390
you know i'm gay should respect re know
that what he said was

703
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,029
and this was printed go home to your
friends and family come out

704
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:10,329
tell them listen when you're talking
about killing other

705
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:13,400
did well I'm

706
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,460
for talking about killing their family
members my friends

707
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,230
and that change things overnight and it
changed overnight because you see

708
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,680
its and it's quite clear to me that

709
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,930
changed because people don't care what
things are far removed from their

710
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,558
people care when it's directly in their
face

711
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,130
and it's something that they are due
respect sure not forcing this issue

712
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,869
you're allowing them to freely choose
and think about it had to change the way

713
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:42,990
that things are going correctly and so I
have lots of friends that used to make

714
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,130
lots of slurs about both the war and

715
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,770
homophobic slurs they don't do that
anymore because they respect and love me

716
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,299
for who I am

717
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:53,440
it so I ask you to remember that so
these people are tested

718
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,779
but you would do the same thing he would
pick up someone who had been shot on the

719
00:42:57,779 --> 00:42:58,690
side of the road

720
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,589
because you are a good person so it
seems to me that we should make sure

721
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:08,230
that we don't forget this there's a lot
of spin involved with this video

722
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,730
but it's wrong it's very clear what
happened here

723
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,000
which is that it was a series of murders
people

724
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,730
who were unarmed people who were very
clearly

725
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,710
walking through the streets at a normal
city I mean sure to say it's a war

726
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:27,250
we brought them the war so it's very
hard to fault them for this

727
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,809
and it's also quite clear to me that
people on the streets there

728
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,859
defend themselves because there isn't a
simple normal

729
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:38,190
saying what we have here you don't just
have certain expectations

730
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,579
anything can happen but that doesn't
mean

731
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,670
if someone has something that looks like
a goner that absolutely

732
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:48,789
is your could be a tripod could be a
camera

733
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:52,079
but what's most telling about this is
that the US military new

734
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,369
all of this and instead of copying to it
they tried to cover

735
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:59,380
how the journalist got that video so up
in the air

736
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,089
the fact that they didn't release it is
quite clear but now you have it

737
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:06,380
so now you know so now it's up to us to
change something as a result

738
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,240
this on a technical level

739
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,640
this was a a test drive a new home
hosting architecture so you probably

740
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,509
also heard about that September 11th
pager messages that were released

741
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:22,509
there is pager messages were a prototype
for this system

742
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:26,339
it's not pretty but it's not meant to be
pretty it's meant to deliver the

743
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:27,259
information to you

744
00:44:27,259 --> 00:44:30,950
to replicate it to distribute it some
way to be skillful in a way that is very

745
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:31,579
difficult

746
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:34,950
sensor and the purpose here is to make
them

747
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:39,259
major political impact and we did we met
our goal

748
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,460
which we always do

749
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,710
so let's be clear about something: this
is obviously in the air and it's

750
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,029
extremely important

751
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:52,450
to status there is someone who has been
alleged

752
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,450
to be a source of by a person

753
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,049
who has no name in this community
anymore

754
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:06,049
to have agreement on that

755
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,150
I'm sorry I didn't hear

756
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:25,150
could be tried again put a little
sincerity

757
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,970
thank you for doing my face in this
community

758
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,279
I was a little bit archer maybe not too
much but

759
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,700
I believe that the key thing here to
remember is silence

760
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,839
non-violence okay this person

761
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:50,049
prides himself on being heard and
thought about

762
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:54,910
just forget them they are irrelevant
they are not making a change that

763
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,940
creates the world that we want to see

764
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,239
and you can agree with me just
forgetting

765
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:05,349
doesn't exist is an important he is it
important

766
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:09,739
so for someone alleged to be our source

767
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,319
we are going to support them this is a
very serious

768
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:17,089
the charges that her leveled against him
are not something like two or three

769
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:18,089
month

770
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:21,630
at the moment the charges that were
leveled arr well

771
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,920
let's say pretty serious day

772
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,230
looks like somewhere over 50 years and
prison

773
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,869
that's a pretty serious amount of time
in jail

774
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:38,009
and a can you imagine this the
information you have in your head

775
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:41,579
that information is the thing that he

776
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:46,079
is alleged to have done how can we as a
society

777
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,140
do something like that we kept

778
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,808
we have to support so let's be quite
clear about this

779
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,839
there is a legal support for him

780
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,558
but there are some problems Julia and I
were speaking

781
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:02,739
a couple days ago he told me that there
are some

782
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:06,420
jacks involved and there are some
lawyers with clearances

783
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,289
and not all the lawyers have a clearance

784
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:13,940
and none of the lawyers are checks it
appears

785
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,130
join us stated that there are seven
lawyers but most importantly

786
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,170
summer the lawyers have agreed to take
fifty thousand dollars

787
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,660
that fifty thousand dollars though is
not enough they say

788
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,399
they wish to have two hundred thousand
dollars minimum

789
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,869
before continuing further that means
we've got some fundraising to do

790
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:37,460
that's pretty serious so those of you
that are working at a nonprofit

791
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,519
and you wanna raise some funds in some
way maybe it's a matching donations

792
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,999
now is the time to leverage that for
everyone to view the believes

793
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:49,579
that someone who is accused to have done
a thing like this needs our support

794
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:52,970
now is the time to make that support
this is a person that

795
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:57,430
if something happens here if he is
convicted this is quite serious

796
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,578
that is an entire young man's life in

797
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:03,839
jail in a military prison almost
certainly

798
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,960
and that is not something that I can
support

799
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,609
and I and many people with your pics are
very clearly working directly

800
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:15,089
against that outcome we want to see him
walk free

801
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:18,519
and we can to do that with with her

802
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:21,950
every point of view weirdly getting up
in helping us

803
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:28,029
it is a necessity there is a website

804
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:31,089
Bradley Manning's out or somebody you
know about this from

805
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:35,970
this is being spearheaded by a number of
people it's extremely important

806
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,259
you visit the site you read it that you
look for information there

807
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:42,829
this person is really taking leave this
group of people

808
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:45,930
is really making a difference they're
extremely

809
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:49,259
extremely good at their heart is in the
right place and its

810
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,599
it's important to remember man is
alleged to have done these things he is

811
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,710
not convicted

812
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:59,190
so I wanna go on to create a world

813
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:04,349
quite clearly it doesn't have to have
these

814
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:08,619
it's a concern square instead of the law
being used to prosecute alleged sources

815
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:12,349
we are going to make some big changes

816
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,460
so there's a country called

817
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,789
Iceland which cell if you're familiar
with which I previously had mentioned

818
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,069
and Iceland is pretty much the most
fantastic

819
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:27,109
country in the world when it comes to
freedom of information its

820
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:30,900
really quite amazing it's the type of
place where when you walk down the

821
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,160
street and Reykjavik

822
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,609
you can actually meet parliamentarians
on the street without a security detail

823
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:39,910
and I'll talk to you and I'll have
coffee with you and even take you into

824
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,109
the parliament if you'd like

825
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:48,109
that's a serious representative
democracy in action

826
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,740
WikiLeaks is part of an advisory for

827
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,120
part of the reason that I went Iceland
was also to be part about advisory group

828
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,359
as it or project person

829
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,400
I guess my roles are a little blurred at
the moment but

830
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,180
to be quite clear gimme is much bigger
than WikiLeaks

831
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,799
and is not simply a wicket each project
this is that people love

832
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,890
Iceland say you know a little
transparency could help to string a

833
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:17,990
banking crisis

834
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:22,040
thanks for leaving those documents let's
make sure that we could if I that

835
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,130
that we make sure that people understand
the cultural value

836
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:29,540
that we want to see that that we want to
see that over time when people do those

837
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,820
types of things because

838
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:35,070
those people bankrupted our entire
nation so

839
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:39,150
it is an attempt at that and imagine if
you will for a moment

840
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:42,730
the Bill of Rights it's pretty fantastic

841
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:47,340
well it turns out that it's not quite
good enough and I say that is a pretty

842
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:51,490
reasonable and loyal American which is
to say

843
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:56,760
screen has better press protection laws
I still will soon have better press

844
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,630
protection laws

845
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,240
Belgium has better press protection laws
lots of other places in the world

846
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,100
have better human rights records so we
wanted to take

847
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,810
things from all over the world including
actually New York State which has

848
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,630
anti libel tourism laws specifically
generated

849
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,210
in response to some other things
happening in the United Kingdom and so

850
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,330
this is really important because what he
is doing

851
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,120
is it building a super information state

852
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,200
right and it sets up an example for the
rest of the world to follow

853
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,230
and even the Prime Minister

854
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,340
Iceland voted for this because you see

855
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,360
it passed unanimously and Iceland 50
people

856
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,380
in their parliament including the Prime
Minister

857
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,460
and

858
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,240
I wanna make this thank you I wanna make
this totally clear

859
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,460
this is not just WikiLeaks this is

860
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,880
a lot of people and this is extremely
important

861
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,680
I believe because icelanders acting in
solidarity with the idea that you have

862
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,140
the right to know what's going on here

863
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:07,879
that history shall not be erased that
when things take place

864
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,620
that we will know for and that will show
them and that when a big corporation was

865
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,350
a lot of money

866
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,190
or when a government that has a lot of
guns says that you're going to pretend

867
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,070
that it didn't

868
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,450
well we're not going to standard take
that

869
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,640
and Iceland has decided that they also
are not going to

870
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,740
it's not finished in that

871
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,890
they're going to go through several more
rounds and

872
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:35,509
re vote on it again but the mere fact
that it passed unanimously should give

873
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,710
you an idea about how well this is going
to go

874
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:42,750
and the European Union actually passed a
resolution in support of him

875
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,230
and this is incredible because
essentially

876
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:51,530
that means that isolated is leading the
way and is doing so in such a way that

877
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,210
the European superstate

878
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,270
is taking notice and following so it's
kinda

879
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:02,130
up to america now to follow we need to
pass resolutions here

880
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,680
locally to make this a possibility and
nationally

881
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,200
that strengthen the things that are
prostitution says very clearly

882
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,400
and redefine them so that they count in
the digital age

883
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,940
in a way that is absolutely without
question because a lot of people like to

884
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,410
pretend that there's a moral panic
around the internet

885
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:23,230
so if you'd like when you see
information on Wikileaks print it out

886
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,590
and hand it to someone

887
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,840
and then it's a newspaper it's not
different

888
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,910
except that can't be stopped you can't
force collaboration

889
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:36,420
I like the New York Times Online but did
you know

890
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,490
today senator on the information that
Bush was doing warrantless wiretapping

891
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:47,490
free here until the election past what

892
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,260
on its unbelievable right that is the
type of collaboration

893
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,910
I don't want to see any more so gotta be
the trouble you want to see in the world

894
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,290
and you gotta be the change you want to
see in the world so

895
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:06,880
thanks to Iceland and the people I
slowed we're going to see that in the

896
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,680
future

897
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,890
and we're going to see a lot of things
change so

898
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,310
I wanna skip around a little bit here
there's a lot of technical criticism

899
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,930
and a lot of misdirection a lot of
misinformation Simona go through these

900
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:19,450
things

901
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:23,680
reasonably fast and I know that so if
you're getting a little antsy because

902
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,170
our club marty is kicking in

903
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,570
so an answer a bunch of the questions in

904
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,520
I'm going to address many of the
criticisms that people have made so

905
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,910
first evolved there's been some one who
has said that WikiLeaks was

906
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,750
started by sniffing networks and I'm
gonna say

907
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,369
but that's not true rare to make that a
record

908
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,980
to make it very clear which deviates is
an idea that has been going

909
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:52,100
Hong long before the Tor network even
existed

910
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,800
so to say that is a course to show that
not only does that person not having a

911
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,180
fucking clue

912
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,190
but actually probably wrong

913
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:04,290
furthermore states use me as it or
developer

914
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:08,480
having done this and well I really
appreciate the idea that they think that

915
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,350
I would be such a terrible person

916
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,490
and I appreciate i mean I don't
appreciate actually

917
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,970
towards privacy by design that means

918
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,900
meeting at or developer is totally
irrelevant to the situation

919
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,570
correction software gets put into our
get repository

920
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,950
in no way does that information help

921
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:33,700
the notes that are exiting from the Tor
network are not controlled by

922
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,640
if I run an exit know that has nothing
to do with whether or not I'm it or

923
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,250
developer

924
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,780
but i can state do not and have not
sniff the torn our

925
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:44,440
and certainly not for documents and
WikiLeaks was

926
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,950
absolutely not started by setting the
Tor network

927
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,359
so hopefully that's clear and hopefully
no more

928
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,490
she rag publications on the web

929
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,540
will state that because it's quite clear
that some of them

930
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,920
like to email four hours before they
publish a story and expect a comment

931
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,230
Pacific Standard Time which is not
exactly an ethical thing to do

932
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:13,540
probably going to be public quite
quickly and specifically the documents

933
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:19,960
that they said really so that's that's
really important right

934
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:26,960
those what there are normal so that

935
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,710
really important right those whether our
normal submission process

936
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:35,800
anyway crypto

937
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,820
someone you know about this by John
Young I think that John Young

938
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:44,010
is probably a pretty good time I've
never met him

939
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:47,400
love to meet him someday a fantastic
well

940
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:54,400
today is not the day for him but but
it's really important to note she is

941
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:55,920
doing something very good

942
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,960
but it is not the same as what wikiLeaks
is doing in fact

943
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,720
when she publishes information that is
provably and clearly false

944
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,869
that's not really so good and
information better

945
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:10,970
and I think that's kind of a shame when
that happens

946
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,220
so I just like to say that with all due
respect is incorrect

947
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:20,490
there's a pretty funny thing that's been
on there recently

948
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:26,170
and I just like to address it is pure
comedy gold the WikiLeaks entire

949
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,050
whoever you are I imagine that your
you're in the audience or watching it on

950
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,960
a streamer watching this video later

951
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,160
it is increase read a billion is a
fantastically wrong

952
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,890
things that you're saying are incorrect
and just to show the rest for you guys

953
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,069
for some tips for the insider

954
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,800
just like so you can reach even correct
here insider trading

955
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,940
so we can have her continued morale
boost we like them to be a little fun

956
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,280
here

957
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,200
if you could maybe step if you were a
bit forget a couple basic facts right

958
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,200
Julian as someone who has spent many a
night sleeping in a hotel room

959
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,820
about five feet from Julie and I could
tell you if he does not live a life of

960
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,480
luxury

961
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,730
world and I kinda sucks but

962
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:14,119
there's an insider tip for a rare he
does not live a life of luxury in South

963
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:14,740
Africa

964
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,040
in fact as far as I know and its first
really has told me he's never actually

965
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,130
been to South Africa now I know Africa

966
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,420
is a large continent and its not a
country

967
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,690
on so in case this is not clear

968
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,710
you know I don't know if the insiders
say like Sarah Palin or not but

969
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,369
I do think that it's that it's quite
clear to be at least

970
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:37,790
that on benefactors from very very
clearly on

971
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,810
10-year is actually in Africa also

972
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:44,040
but it is again non South Africa south
africa is a

973
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,950
country okay so the while

974
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:51,510
the Warsaw Poland Wow by German is gone
either

975
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:55,250
okay so the nonprofit in Germany

976
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:59,260
that does help us quite a bit that does
a lot

977
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,359
love funding and takes donations they
keep records

978
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:07,119
they show quite clearly that Julian does
not by Business Class

979
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,849
plane tickets and will I travel up phone
to a hundred and fifty thousand miles a

980
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:12,280
year

981
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,780
someone that is in coach and it is not
necessarily the most comfortable

982
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,940
I'm but certain other costs that we take

983
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,520
you know like it to detect the talk but
we do it and all of us

984
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,220
and also WikiLeaks very clearly cares
enough to be Stockton Calif us to make

985
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,830
this happen

986
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:31,940
right and we do that I think that's
totally reasonable and your records that

987
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,440
show it

988
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,040
so when you say otherwise you have to
back that up for some serious

989
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,960
serious proof and it's pretty I think
despicable to see otherwise

990
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,700
and know what WikiLeaks takes a salary

991
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,070
says this is really important

992
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:53,190
I work full time job but or and that's
what I dedicated my life to you

993
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,240
and Julia and other people have worked

994
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,109
for their whole lives to be in a
position to be able to tell the truth

995
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:01,259
and to take a stand

996
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,640
for other people and to use a that we
are somehow

997
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,920
ripping people off is ridiculous head

998
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,490
it requires a statement credibility
which

999
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,930
to WikiLeaks insider does not have so

1000
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:19,950
for you guys have a special role

1001
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,300
each one of you has a set of skills we
have a lot of information

1002
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,010
we want your help processing it we
specifically would like people that are

1003
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,330
good at visualizations

1004
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:33,240
people who maybe you're good at bearings
people who liked to paint pictures

1005
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,359
whatever you want to do however you want
to tell stories

1006
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:42,380
I can be extremely useful to us and to
the rest of the world

1007
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,830
everyone will see the visualizations
that you have done millions of people

1008
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,049
not going to get a

1009
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:51,690
preach about it gonna have to do in your
spare time you're gonna have to

1010
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:56,970
get rid of all your spare time actually
but it will make a huge impact

1011
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:59,980
because when people interact with
complicated data

1012
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,580
they have this totally new relationship
to that data right

1013
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:07,619
to have the ability to like look at the
data and explore the data

1014
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:11,330
and engages them in a way that
previously they just wouldn't even care

1015
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,640
so this is I think extremely extremely

1016
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,379
important because it engages that's
something that we really need

1017
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:22,690
his people to be sincerely engaged so
for

1018
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,100
especially since this is a hacker
conference I think that this is

1019
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,900
important

1020
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,020
if we build systems that are privacy by
design instead of privacy by policy

1021
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,300
if we build protocols that are extremely
difficult the filter

1022
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,930
I know that there are people that work
on this here that this is really useful

1023
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,869
because not every country enjoys the
warrantless wiretapping surveillance the

1024
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:42,730
reader

1025
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:46,100
some people enjoy the warrantless
wiretapping plus

1026
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,150
serious press and police force kicking
down the door in response

1027
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:53,780
is that it just building large does he
is that a yes later

1028
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,380
so building protocols that can help
avoid people leaving behind a footprint

1029
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,150
now

1030
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:03,010
can make a big difference tomorrow
because the story that your data trail

1031
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,119
tells about you

1032
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:07,359
might not matter to you know but when
you fill

1033
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,950
someone doing something and then you
uploaded and the sensor data from your

1034
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,070
camera is used as a weapon against you

1035
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:17,190
and it's found by finding photos on
Flickr that you took up your family

1036
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:20,200
that's a really serious problem so we
need tools

1037
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,839
like for example to find and fingerprint
sensor data and to remove it

1038
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:28,470
there's a lot of stuff lot to NT
forensic stuff needs to be done to

1039
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:29,080
protect

1040
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,790
whistleblowers ever need help from a you
should focus your activities there

1041
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:37,160
we can really use that help and you will
make a difference you personally might

1042
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,868
save a life

1043
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:42,170
and this is probably the most important
for

1044
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,000
every single one of us is a productive
member of society and some point

1045
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,390
in our lives we get to choose which were
up to

1046
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:54,040
we make so we get to decide if we go
home and work for military defense

1047
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,119
contractor

1048
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,740
or for if we go home and we work on
something

1049
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,869
that shows that some of those people do
the right thing

1050
01:03:01,869 --> 01:03:05,130
and some of them do not ever find our
society not

1051
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:08,900
by specifically saying that all those
people are bad by saying some of these

1052
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:09,780
actions are bad

1053
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,380
these are the actions that I can support
that I can put my name on but these

1054
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,330
aren't they don't

1055
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:16,680
is it firmly believe this job is
something that needs to be done

1056
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,710
so this is something I think that we get
to choose and

1057
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:23,300
since be built the system's up tomorrow
we are the ones that get to decide the

1058
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,900
politics of the system's

1059
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,630
the architecture is the political system
right internet is so amazing

1060
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,750
specifically because

1061
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,680
it is so open and it is so free

1062
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,740
so how many here are upset about our
submission system

1063
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,060
somebody any beer 1 percent fantastic I
hope you are the leader

1064
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:48,490
keep your hands down okay

1065
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:52,380
this is funny thing happens I mean
different X does

1066
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:56,190
anything their publications that just
jump up and down on its

1067
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:59,310
usually because we make them irrelevant
but that said

1068
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,580
for they get really upset so

1069
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,029
to be clear sometimes things happen that
are not obvious

1070
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:10,830
the security of our systems is more
important than fighting a PR war

1071
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:14,299
with people that can't father to ask
properly

1072
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,450
contextualize questions in a reasonable
time

1073
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,190
so we have relaunched the submission
site

1074
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,650
there you go would this is a new SSL
certificate

1075
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:28,430
and there is a bit or hidden service so

1076
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:31,359
for those of you that worried about
submission those of you that want it

1077
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:33,180
leaked documents

1078
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,770
its back so everyone should take a
photograph a value-added service Europe

1079
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:44,770
I'll leave it up for a moment

1080
01:04:47,069 --> 01:04:50,779
these are the fingerprints a salute you
know for

1081
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:54,560
certificate authorities well they do and
Noble job

1082
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,130
are part of both a system that isn't
really sustainable when the threat model

1083
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,500
might include

1084
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,730
large governments and large corporations
sometimes

1085
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:07,630
people in different countries end up in
situations where

1086
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:11,010
they have to use a copy of an operating
system where all the certificate

1087
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:14,020
authorities are removed except for one
so that they can be met in the middle

1088
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,319
transparently

1089
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:19,930
is a very serious issue so the only way
to be to do this is to solve it with key

1090
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:20,730
change

1091
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:24,510
pretty much directly if you use the
submission process

1092
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:28,010
this is the center fingerprints you
should expect to see

1093
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:31,440
from now on and that means that while
the certificate authority can give you

1094
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,030
warm fuzzies this slide is what will
save your ass

1095
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:39,100
to take some photos either put it online
taggers

1096
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,290
spread it around because someone
somewhere is going to need to see their

1097
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:50,290
and that's where you can make a
difference right now

1098
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:54,240
okay so got a wicked so you read about
it

1099
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,490
we decided to clean out a lot of stuff
old accounts that are saying year old

1100
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:02,300
and that are being used old content
silly vandalism from keys pissing on it

1101
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,369
we remove that stuff and there's a lot
of progress on

1102
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:08,810
updating the key making it faster
dealing with things that are extremely

1103
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:10,369
important

1104
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:13,520
as a course coming first but in general
we do try to take care of this and we do

1105
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,300
some housecleaning

1106
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,560
and we've got some cool stuff coming up
so for example

1107
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,720
.torrent & magnet links specifically for
all the contact

1108
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,580
so you don't just have to rely on us you
can possible but our client and you can

1109
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,190
pretty much be us

1110
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:33,390
how awesome is that it also means that
we'll have

1111
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:37,020
for free York

1112
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,150
it also means that we'll have dynamic
you're all support but there's a little

1113
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,970
bit her problem we need some people to
write some support and some other

1114
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,069
clients

1115
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:47,859
so if you work on BitTorrent here's a
great thing that you can do today

1116
01:06:47,859 --> 01:06:51,619
we need to make sure that dynamic man in
Euros are working and they work pretty

1117
01:06:51,619 --> 01:06:52,420
well

1118
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,490
so this is something that will allow you
to download on a regular basis for

1119
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,690
example all the documents containing

1120
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,990
everything to do with United States and
you can do that

1121
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:07,470
like him and you can hear that data case
you know a rainy day comes

1122
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:10,660
so we've also done a bunch of other
things

1123
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,950
it's really hard to actually tell what
we have done it helps to have a lot of

1124
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,420
hackers on board that can

1125
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,650
office did a little bit of our
architecture but I think it's important

1126
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:19,400
to you

1127
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,030
sort of state quite clearly we have a
lot of redundancy involved

1128
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,790
and we have a lot of work that has gone
into making sure that it's not exactly

1129
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:30,529
obvious how it is redundant so that
makes it a lot harder to attack

1130
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:34,540
and we don't really have to worry about
that we don't see a lot of things that

1131
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:35,240
are

1132
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,520
terribly scarier to be quite honest the
scariest things that we see here

1133
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,430
usually the content of submissions and
that stuff can be quite scary

1134
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:46,869
you know because have seen their so for

1135
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:49,960
there's going to be a period of time
without commenting overturn

1136
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,670
and probably at some point you'll see
for enhanced or support

1137
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:57,150
with the wiki IRC

1138
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:00,200
there is a course a way for you to come
and chat directly with people involved

1139
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,100
with WikiLeaks

1140
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:05,510
there's some privacy protections that
are built into the system and

1141
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:08,810
they are pretty simple

1142
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,839
so if you're just sitting there I like
wanting to collect information large

1143
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:12,560
it's not

1144
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,990
not really that helpful we would
appreciate it if you don't do that but

1145
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,950
in any case you can see that there are
some things that will start to hide

1146
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:23,439
a little bit information at a time it's
not perfect but we think it's pretty

1147
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:23,830
good

1148
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:26,929
it's for the better than just read a
fire see however there is a protection

1149
01:08:26,929 --> 01:08:27,960
so that people can

1150
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,880
say d-mass crew you are very easily

1151
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:36,080
and of course we're launching a new web
chat interface which also will be

1152
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,568
secured i think is pretty fantastic

1153
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:43,140
so we'd also today as a what time is it

1154
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:46,410
I guess it's probably after one so

1155
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:49,870
this there's no blog because we want to
be

1156
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,759
more transparent and open with you guys
we want to make sure that you have

1157
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:54,560
questions that their

1158
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,770
answer quite frankly wanna make sure
that you understand that we are on your

1159
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:58,759
side

1160
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:02,140
right we don't wanna fight we don't want
to have a misinformation campaign going

1161
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:02,989
on for ever

1162
01:09:02,989 --> 01:09:06,660
takes a for energy it takes over time
very easy so you know just have to look

1163
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,219
at Twitter

1164
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:10,730
in order to see this love your blog
people right here

1165
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:15,819
some people whatever right to it and
they'll just do work behind the scenes

1166
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:19,130
but it's extremely important that we
tell you what's going on because

1167
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,880
whenever we do anything

1168
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,160
when we take down the submission site to
make sure that there are some new things

1169
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,250
they can be launched

1170
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,479
we need to make sure that we let you
know about it so that doesn't cause a

1171
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,600
huge problem

1172
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,640
in the media where we have to take a lot
of time away from doing important work

1173
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,830
to talk to you

1174
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,939
people that are not going to you be very
helpful and

1175
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,580
some cases are quite hostile so

1176
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:46,370
we also want to sort of step into web
2.0 you're going to release an API

1177
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:49,528
she'll be able to get the data in a more
usable way

1178
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:52,239
so you'll be able to do the things that
you want with the data she'll be able to

1179
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:53,270
make visualizations

1180
01:09:53,270 --> 01:10:00,270
it'll be much much is here

1181
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:08,299
okay so some miscellaneous technical
details I guess I love you guys are more

1182
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,219
interested in this than all the leaks
and things like that you know how we run

1183
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:14,540
a system like this

1184
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,140
basically compartmentalization that's
the

1185
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,460
the key right wanna make sure things are
cover compartmentalized is absolutely

1186
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:26,280
prepared if that we have a situation
that when we involve a new person

1187
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,759
they don't have access to everything
think about the content that we're

1188
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,429
dealing with and then you instantly
understand why that is a necessity

1189
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:37,100
so when we get new people involved you
might get access to assist at some point

1190
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,110
and when you get access to that system
that will be a very small sliver

1191
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:43,920
access you'll have to work in a way that
shows that it is it not possible for you

1192
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,920
to be traps

1193
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,380
I think that's totally reasonable what
do you guys think

1194
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,429
awesome

1195
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:56,620
inch by inch writer so more horsepower

1196
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:00,519
we've got a lot of servers driving a lot
of things and it's working on relatively

1197
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:00,969
well

1198
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:04,139
think that it's in fact extremely
important for

1199
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:08,070
making sure that these things are gonna
stay up and they're going to be able to

1200
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:08,840
do their job

1201
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,239
clatter murder was hosted on a new
architecture and

1202
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,870
course very few people noticed that
because it went off without a hitch

1203
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:19,960
there was no question it just worked but
they were very special improvements to

1204
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,100
make that possible

1205
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,239
but if you do find a problem have an
idea

1206
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,360
this is another one on some journalists
out there and other publications that

1207
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,290
Shall Not Be Named

1208
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:32,460
on well quite frankly they

1209
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,150
instead of dropping in dire si which may
be too difficult for them to use

1210
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:40,089
or sending an e-mail in a reasonable
amount of time they don't they don't do

1211
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:40,770
those things

1212
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:44,190
so you can do that instead if you do
notice or you have a monitoring system

1213
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,480
and you want to set up in you want to
monitor the system a little bit not to

1214
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:47,980
even

1215
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:51,270
invasive way we would totally love to
hear from there

1216
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:54,710
right we can use your help if you see
something wrong you say something that

1217
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,179
has

1218
01:11:55,179 --> 01:11:58,510
expired or you see some piece of
information that is changed

1219
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:02,260
if you see a certificate that's being
men in the middle by an ISP

1220
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:05,489
if you see that you can reach the site
let us know

1221
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:09,639
chances are if you can't reach the site
you can use torture reach the site and

1222
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:10,150
then you can

1223
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:14,860
isolate the network problem and you can
figure out who's doing what and of

1224
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:15,330
course

1225
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:19,090
we want to basically take the
information that we have

1226
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:22,330
that is in the wiki and we want to move
it into

1227
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:25,330
sort of more interesting forms

1228
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:29,000
be so that's something that we're very
much working on

1229
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,150
and we think they're which he is
extremely important

1230
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:37,000
but we also think that there's something
more than that so it's going to change

1231
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,810
some

1232
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:42,610
something in the future so I talk a
little bit about or have you heard about

1233
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:44,019
that and a fine I guess

1234
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:47,790
their you've all heard it or rare okay

1235
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:51,769
first as a developer allow me to
apologize for being sometimes slow

1236
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:56,080
I'm sorry as I said it or talk yesterday
with Seth

1237
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,750
I don't know how fast you wanna die but
we need to do it securely

1238
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,100
that's the first and most important
thing there are people who use the

1239
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,800
software

1240
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,239
in every country in the world and some
use it because that is the thread

1241
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:11,810
so we want to make sure that it is
privacy security and anonymity by design

1242
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:15,150
on speedy for bit torrent their chance
for that

1243
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:18,780
so I'm sorry that it is in faster but it
works

1244
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,969
and works pretty well so which each

1245
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:26,699
really support store and that means that
sometimes their own servers

1246
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:30,860
me and sometimes they make sure that
some systems are accessible experts

1247
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,509
epically retort for example the
submission system

1248
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:37,409
that submission system that is adanya is
one that if you have some concerns

1249
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:39,940
that's definitely the best one to use

1250
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:43,489
it'll be very very difficult for someone
to know or to tamper with

1251
01:13:43,489 --> 01:13:47,540
and encrypt it Fred done in URL in fact

1252
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,560
is a cryptographic keys so if you have
that right URL

1253
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,159
you have end and encryption sure is that
you're talking to a few weeks and those

1254
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:56,750
keys are extremely protected

1255
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:01,170
and I think that that is the right thing
for you to use if you want to

1256
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:06,040
and of course every document being
available or tore something that we feel

1257
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,940
very strongly about

1258
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:10,070
we especially support people using
torture reach

1259
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:13,790
wiki leaks that is extremely important
as well because

1260
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:17,560
not everybody has the right to visit
that site not everyone wants to tie

1261
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,230
themselves to have a visit that site

1262
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:23,320
well and if you might be supporters
vocally someone you might only be

1263
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,420
supporters inside

1264
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:27,980
using it on a position system so that
you don't have to obtain yourself if you

1265
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:28,639
don't want to

1266
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,810
and of course there's a lot of
development that needs to happen

1267
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:36,909
for example tore uses TCP connections
between all the other towards

1268
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:40,429
that means that all the circuits and
connections are multiplexed

1269
01:14:40,429 --> 01:14:43,469
between single TCP connections and

1270
01:14:43,469 --> 01:14:47,340
we're working on some alternate designs
potentially YouTube leave you with

1271
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,300
detail s

1272
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:52,060
and using SCTP on top which means that
we have

1273
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:55,239
inability to do better flow control and
I would allow us to not have so many

1274
01:14:55,239 --> 01:14:56,100
bottlenecks

1275
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,409
but in order to do that we need some
badass developers and tore of course

1276
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:03,679
is that sometimes especially right now
higher

1277
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:07,260
to go to quit your corporate job come
work at the very best free software

1278
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,670
company to save the world

1279
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,730
well we're looking for some help so

1280
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:16,710
if you don't wanna quit your job and
you're enjoying it just fine

1281
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:19,810
we could also use some more relays and
especially exit relays

1282
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:23,250
and if you're worried about abuse
limited so that you can only exit

1283
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:26,600
to WikiLeaks if that's what you want to
support you can send a very strong

1284
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,400
message and you can help a great deal

1285
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:33,000
because anonymity is required not just
for our sources but also many of our

1286
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,560
readers

1287
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:40,190
to you can be part of the solution on
that I think Julian will probably end

1288
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:41,870
with something I think that is

1289
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,019
I guess a little little more

1290
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:48,850
inspiring you would say something is
typical Australian accent and floss is

1291
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:52,130
blonde hair around and smile a lot
butter

1292
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,550
I will just say

1293
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:59,290
this which is there

1294
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:03,179
we don't know anything without knowing

1295
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:06,730
about history these leaks

1296
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:10,120
that we've been talking about they are
the guidebook for the future

1297
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:14,500
because they're not written to coerce
they're not written for someone to you

1298
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:19,420
manipulate your opinion these are
written specifically as inside documents

1299
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,370
the tell you how these organizations
work

1300
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:24,380
tell you about events that occurred it
lets you know

1301
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:28,179
for what actually going on

1302
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:31,530
which piece these documents together it
allows you

1303
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,559
to know for what the future will know
about history

1304
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,080
it will pave the road that we can walk
on as

1305
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,860
human culture not as nation-state
isolated people

1306
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:47,339
not as people there are creeped into
good and bad but everyone schindler

1307
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:51,179
the progress of science is because
people came before us and made

1308
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:55,810
painstaking efforts to understand the
way the world works

1309
01:16:55,810 --> 01:17:00,469
and so we have to do the same thing with
historical records not just with

1310
01:17:00,469 --> 01:17:04,530
scientific knowledge although it's
important to move journalism in the

1311
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:05,889
direction of Science

1312
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:10,710
by making sure that they have a citation
right crossing the xkcd comic that talks

1313
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,150
about citation needed

1314
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:15,820
well this is really important that we
hold journalist to this

1315
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:19,849
when they say some source says this

1316
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:23,500
sometimes there's a need for an enemy
that's quite clear when they say

1317
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,739
many of their critics say this there
sometimes we look at a

1318
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:30,100
we look up who the critics are and it's
usually like one person on one block

1319
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,550
somewhere search for six hours to find

1320
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:35,600
so they should take their so that people
know that that statement is about as

1321
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,170
credible

1322
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:40,370
as it isn't actually

1323
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:45,130
so I understand that there's a little
bit attention about the fact that we're

1324
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:48,460
were not always the best to respond we
have limited resources and you can only

1325
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,540
imagine the amount of contact that we
get

1326
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,280
piracy is probably a little bit better
because it means that people are

1327
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,929
constantly reading it

1328
01:17:54,929 --> 01:17:59,679
butter it's very obvious that while some
love you want to do the right thing

1329
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:04,159
there a few people a few bad apples
wanna do the wrong thing

1330
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,799
and so we have to be very very careful
about we let their

1331
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,230
because we have things that quite
frankly

1332
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:14,980
could mean the difference between life
and death and so please be patient with

1333
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:15,610
us

1334
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:18,969
because we want to work with you we have
to work with you

1335
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:22,090
we need your help but we can't always be
there

1336
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:26,460
and respond instantly so don't be upset
if you send us an email you don't get a

1337
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,409
response five minutes later

1338
01:18:28,409 --> 01:18:31,509
sometimes doesn't have it sometimes it
might take weeks

1339
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:36,340
because there are things that are going
on inside that just quite simply

1340
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:40,860
we can drop no matter how much help it
is much easier if you say I can offer

1341
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,059
tend to give it a second mail me a box
no hassle

1342
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:48,510
no problem then it is if you say well
tell me about your requirements what you

1343
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:49,350
need and so on

1344
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,920
and we have to take a lot of time so if
you've got there do the first

1345
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,370
not the second and if you don't have he
believed to be the first please don't do

1346
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,599
the second

1347
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,290
wait until you're able and of course
this is probably the most important

1348
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:07,269
if you just work on the things bike I
see there's a noise rich people in back

1349
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:10,420
16 back there was really
individualization its

1350
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:15,440
work on things for large-scale datasets
for visualizations like he's doing

1351
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,900
and he has nothing to do with this but
the fact that he has has inspired us to

1352
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,969
think about the fact that

1353
01:19:19,969 --> 01:19:23,070
visualizations like that can really make
a big impact

1354
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:27,330
and that is something that if you just
work on that your work speaks for itself

1355
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:30,559
and we can help to you director a little
bit

1356
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,670
but you can direct yourself your
creative tasks the way that you work

1357
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,840
will be extremely powerful and of course

1358
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,010
it's really important that you make it
public and especially if you can really

1359
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,530
source code

1360
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:46,230
and source code is very helpful because
it allows us to make sure that you're

1361
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:49,099
not sending us for example a binary that
when we're on their

1362
01:19:49,099 --> 01:19:53,440
does something kind of nasty mean we we
all know how to use either pro

1363
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,880
we don't want to waste our time doing
rare said the source code and show us

1364
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,770
that you

1365
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:02,659
you know work with us and I'd like to
emphasize this phrase

1366
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:06,159
think globally hack locally

1367
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:10,589
so if each one a view thinks about the
impact you have on the world

1368
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:14,150
go home work in your communities change
the world

1369
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:18,179
by changing for people around you by
changing the situation around here

1370
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:22,110
and you'll do basic facts there's no
question

1371
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:25,389
so you can enable people to speak freely
right now

1372
01:20:25,389 --> 01:20:28,690
by running a torch relay every single
one of you that has a computer and

1373
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,940
install torrent check a single box

1374
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:34,370
and when you do that you will grow the
network there are currently two thousand

1375
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:35,889
or relays are so in the world

1376
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:41,110
there are more than 2,000 people I hope
it every person hackers on planet Earth

1377
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:44,699
stops making excuses start making a
difference you will double the size of

1378
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:46,260
the Tor network

1379
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:51,810
that's incredible if you do that you
will make a measurable impact

1380
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:55,870
and so together we will make gigantic
change

1381
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:59,120
in the world so I want to make it clear

1382
