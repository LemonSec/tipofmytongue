1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,240
it's highly controversial in didn't seem
to have ever been covered

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,819
any other hacker conference that we
wanted to turn into a panel

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:11,300
with a with an attorney and maybe
someone for the BFF

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,150
so that's what we did but we didn't
expect wish it to be so difficult to

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,869
find people who'd be willing to
participate in this panel because it

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,250
that controversial nature

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,859
the topic I talk to think about eight
different attorneys the

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,920
didn't want to touch it with a ten-foot
pole on

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,679
Alex months for philadelphia has balls
so where

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,239
here I can explain why here

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,279
he decided to do this but bottom line is
that I thank him for

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,750
for being on this panel because it's
it's a worthwhile topic and then

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,860
us that shown from my BFF technologist
and a is this deal with a lot of the

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,910
cases where E seen a lot of the legal

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,780
side over of cases even without a lawyer
he said

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,860
he seen a lot there deff I'm Ando

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,789
we had regional a after it the panel was
put together we got contacted by one of

18
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,449
the year

19
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:05,309
that the wife of one the defendants in
the case is gonna be discussed here

20
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,710
on Robin feel which was interesting

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,850
Michael feel is a wife she contacted

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,150
very interesting in somehow helping out
with ish and

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,390
such is all set to combat that after a
long discussion with her husband she

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,670
he he decided it's probably not a good
idea for talk about it on

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,320
he has a gag order even though she was
said that all the charges were dropped

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,920
he was sort of or less forced to sign a
gag order in exchange for rent them now

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,630
press the government to prosecuting him

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,699
so I she's not into that restriction but
here

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,729
here nervous breakdown he said had a
heart attack

30
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:45,399
three ish during his case and a he just
didn't need additional stress for the

31
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,680
coverage but it is worth covering
because a

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,030
this could happen to anybody as they say
I'm so without any yet more delay I'm

33
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,159
pretty if you say

34
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,799
to Cicero ship Shonan and Alex months
we'll be talking about the need

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,799
for a computer crime Innocence Project
thank you

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,500
alright to I'm II

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,910
I've been this my first hope and i
notice that not a lot of people were

38
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,849
doing bio so I have three biotite sa

39
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,349
you've probably seen Alex and septa talk
so we'll just go through the BIOS

40
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,599
there %ah thanks to bernie for talking
about the talk that almost wasn't

41
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,329
one thing you didn't mention was that I
hope selection committee even contacted

42
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,769
a Innocence Project

43
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,670
and they were interested in coming and
talking about the need for computer

44
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,170
crime Innocence Project Soul

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,819
very controversial subject up my
schedule for

46
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,989
my part the presentation you know the
disclaimer that

47
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,000
everybody does I wanted I want to talk
about whether or not a problem exists

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,300
and if it doesn't work we're in for a
very short talk today

49
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,090
up some cases in the news that you might
be aware of her might not

50
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,379
%uh a research project that I recently
did that that

51
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,500
prompted me %uh in in the belief that we
need a computer crime Innocence Project

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,700
cost if the defense and there's a lot of
just not

53
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,760
a monetary costs other little review
what I talked about that Alex is gonna

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,540
take over

55
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,129
all right down the views expressed
during my portion of the talk are my

56
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:15,819
views

57
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,450
alone they don't necessarily represent
the views are Alex are saffir the hope

58
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,720
selection committee heard

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,280
the hope conference or my employer so
there's my disclaimer

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,459
I like this quote I'm going to just do
it for

61
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,720
verbatim I'm not in favor of imprisoning
the innocent

62
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,379
but I'm not enthusiastic about freeing
the guilty this talk is not about how to

63
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,310
mask downloading your kiddie porn

64
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,690
with malware this talk is about how

65
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,599
you can use for a proper forensics to
find out what really happened

66
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,000
on a system so that innocent people
don't get convicted of crimes they

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,739
didn't commit

68
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,060
%uh another good quote out on the web I
found was call me naive but I believe

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,680
the two competent diligent computer
forensic examiners acting in good faith

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,330
will usually agree upon the digital
evidence and what I found in my

71
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,780
experience in what I found doing my
research on the web is that never

72
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,709
happens

73
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,819
and that's disappointing you would think
that too

74
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,870
competent forensic examiners would say
yes

75
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,199
I agree that's what happened on the
computer but the defense and the

76
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,060
prosecution

77
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,229
rarely have that happen alright so does
the problem exist up

78
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,310
it doesn't matter whether way in in my

79
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,130
limited experience it doesn't matter
whether you work for the defense or the

80
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,030
prosecution

81
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,220
I believe there are a lot of for Anzac
examiners out there

82
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,680
that are incompetent they claim to know

83
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,880
what they're doing but they really don't
know what they're doing

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,380
and I'm not saying that either side
commits perjury

85
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,360
but if you're not a competent expert and
you testify

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,020
what you testify becomes expert opinion
and it's up to the jury to decide

87
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,270
whether or not you know what you're
talking about

88
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,430
and I want you to think about the
average twelve people on a jury and

89
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,210
highly technical information

90
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,229
0 I guess I am saying that some experts
to commit perjury

91
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:12,479
alright here I have to I %uh

92
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,539
two quotes out on the web I one of them
is from an expert

93
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,310
%uh who runs a forensic company and the
other one

94
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,630
is from our a Oregon detective

95
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,190
%uh the first one is I love the computer
forensic experts I've encountered

96
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,729
ninety-five percent

97
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,680
are dangerous this is somebody who runs
a forensic

98
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,360
company now that what I would hope that
if you get convicted

99
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,680
or not convicted if you get prosecuted
for computer crime

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,770
I'm sure that the other five percent
will be who you run into

101
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,940
now the other quote was viruses could
make folders and say favorite images and

102
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,110
catalog them that was by an Oregon

103
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,440
detective was a forensic expert well we
all know that

104
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,590
viruses and malware could do those
things so here's somebody who's an

105
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,039
expert

106
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,099
well that just can't happen and if you
went to the talk yesterday

107
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,210
about crime where you know that a botnet
could easily make that happen on your

108
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,388
system

109
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,900
I hear some great court transcript this
court transcript is actually from the

110
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,389
Julia marrow case

111
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,350
which we'll be discussing I some good
questions that the question was does

112
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,449
spyware and adware

113
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,220
generate pornography and the experts
answer was

114
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,639
I'm not aware that they do now we can
have a long discussion

115
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,889
about whether or not the attorneys
question was proper

116
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,169
does spyware and adware generate
pornography what he really meant to ask

117
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,000
was

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,710
the spyware and adware cause pornography
to appear on your screen

119
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,130
now I'm sure that the twelve people that
might be on your jury are going to

120
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,520
understand the difference

121
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,990
when attorney asks a question like that

122
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,120
another question whether viruses adware
a spyware on the computer and the

123
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,169
experts answer was to the best of my
knowledge

124
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,770
there was not have that on the PC yet
just before he was asked that question

125
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,139
he had testified that he didn't even
look for spyware and adware

126
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,539
but I'm sure that a jury where you're
being prosecuted

127
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,880
will understand but he just said
something else that they won't be a

128
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,330
slight

129
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,289
asleep when the experts are are I'm not
talking

130
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:25,169
okay so where do these cases happen is
this something that just going on in the

131
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,430
United States no

132
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,259
here's a case this is this one up here

133
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:34,819
was Julian bream %ah Julian Green had

134
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,940
are 172 indecent images on his system

135
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,259
a defense forensic examiners found that
there were 11 Trojans on his computer

136
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,830
and and the quote I found on the web was
that they were

137
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,159
capable of downloading the images well

138
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,930
I would think that a forensic examiner
would know whether or not

139
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,050
I would would say whether or not they
did it

140
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,289
or they didn't do it now I don't know if
the if the person who wrote the article

141
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,818
change the word from we found evidence
that these

142
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,440
that that the malware actually download
these images or

143
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,500
that the the defense said well there
were there was now we're on the system

144
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,860
and the malware might have done it I
don't know that cuz I'm I don't have any

145
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,690
up inside knowledge on this case when I
work read the word capable I thought

146
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,599
well that's that's interesting so

147
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,289
he was eventually acquitted

148
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,710
I here's another case many have you will
probably be familiar with it was the

149
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,300
case of Julia meryl Julia mara was a
substitute teacher

150
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,479
who went into the classroom I believe
she was told not to turn the computer

151
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,690
off

152
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,010
%ah some students either login or use
the computer and all of a sudden

153
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,769
their was soft porn popups that were on
her system

154
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,380
she was actually convicted of impairing

155
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,510
the morals other child she was convicted

156
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,399
because her system had porn popups on it

157
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
%ah the that that you we were we
previously heard some other testimony in

158
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,029
her case now

159
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:07,160
luckily her sentence was delayed four
times

160
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,430
and she was are she had a new trial

161
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,070
and then she ended up pleading that
trial and I believe it was for

162
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,630
disorderly conduct

163
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,930
I we're gonna talk about what happened
to her and how many problem she had

164
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,430
during the whole course this

165
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,010
at the end my presentation here's a case
this was what were the one that bernie

166
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,450
talked about earlier

167
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,959
%uh this is the case of Michael feel his
laptop I believe

168
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,500
his laptop had something can happen is
laptop and they reissued him another

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,740
laptop

170
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,899
and %ah that laptop ended up having
child pornography on it

171
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,899
%uh defense forensic examiner after he
was being

172
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,390
up prosecuted for this went in and found
that that there was all kinds of weird

173
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,330
stuff going on this laptop

174
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,380
up very interesting I found on the web
that two exams by the state attorney

175
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,470
general office concurred with the
defense forensic expert so here's a time

176
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,940
where

177
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,339
all great the the prosecution

178
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:04,079
and the defense agree on the evidence
the problem is

179
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,769
how long that took to happen and what
happens to somebody's life

180
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,529
when when it takes a long other court
ended up concluding that he was

181
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,089
up not right at the court ended up
expunging him

182
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:19,600
his case another case this this case is
Matthew bandy

183
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,300
and not up this was really tried in the
media

184
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,410
up Matthew bandy ended up having

185
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,750
or I don't know how many images yet
buddy I guess the prosecution was for

186
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,450
nineteen

187
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,190
images which in Arizona is nine felony
counts which could be

188
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,670
ninety years in prison now this might be
a case of an overzealous prosecution

189
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,349
I don't know up but it was it was very
adversarial

190
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,180
from the beginning the on the Arizona

191
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,320
are Supreme Court had to rule against
the county attorney's office that didn't

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,510
want to allow

193
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,640
the defense to do an analysis up the
computer

194
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,709
so right away the up

195
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,170
Darke County Attorney's Office that
didn't want to allow the defense

196
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,180
to examine the computer started being
adversarial the family

197
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,300
went out and got burstein crisis
management to build a website to start

198
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,320
discrediting

199
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,310
the County Attorney's Office up

200
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,940
it was just a back and forth in fact you
might have seen a twenty20

201
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,790
up report on this exact case

202
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,620
now I did a lotta research on this case
found a lot of information out on the

203
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,279
web

204
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,380
and since then the prosecutor has
reexamine the system

205
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,209
at least two more times and there's a
lot of information out on the web

206
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,110
that really points to Matthew was guilty

207
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,010
but again I didn't have any inside
knowledge on this it's only what I've

208
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,769
read out on the web

209
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,910
art so little bit my background every
year I do a yearly research project I

210
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,209
like to stay busy

211
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,820
and some of my research projects have
included penetration testing educational

212
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,470
software

213
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,910
analyzing now where and using of
forensic products to test security

214
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,719
when I did my analyzing now where up
project

215
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,459
I learned a bunch of things %uh some
love them I used in

216
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,779
in the last up a project I did that

217
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,329
first to follow it just because their is
malware

218
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:21,740
doesn't mean that it downloaded certain
things we should all be aware that

219
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,300
there's all different types of malware
just because

220
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,940
there's now we're on our system does not
necessarily mean that it downloaded

221
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,269
illegal content.

222
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:34,389
more importantly just because you didn't
find now where does it mean there isn't

223
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,649
any on your system and gain a point to
the presentation yesterday about crime

224
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:39,290
where

225
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,360
there's very easy ways to make your
malware

226
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,649
be be able to be installed on a computer
and not find it so

227
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,490
if up are prosecutorial forensic expert
says

228
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,829
I search for malware on your system and
I didn't find any so there's not going

229
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,220
to be any

230
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,480
in Europe they call it the PhD defense
or

231
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,300
of the Trojan horse defense and in the
united states they call it the saudi

232
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,149
defense or

233
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,560
some other dude did it are that will
identify now where so there's not going

234
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,459
to be that well

235
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,320
that's not the case it's it's quite
possible using normal

236
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,370
up ways to find now where anti virus
that you might not find them our on the

237
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,579
system

238
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,190
I'm gonna show you in my malware
presentation

239
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,230
I actually would the what I was trying
to find out was I had heard

240
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,389
that if you download a screensaver out
on the internet this was about two years

241
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:31,970
ago

242
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,240
that nine out of ten of them have a
virus or or are now where

243
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,680
so I thought that's interesting I'm
gonna prove that so I went out and I

244
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,019
downloaded this dolphin screensaver

245
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,860
and I shot it out to virus told one at
this time buyers total would

246
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,540
search search it with 39 different virus
protection packages

247
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,480
and 1 %uh the 39 found something wrong

248
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,810
and what did they find wrong it said the
file is damaged so how many have you

249
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,000
when you saw this we're just go ahead
and install it

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,709
right 39 different anti viruses say this
this this application is fine

251
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:09,600
I'll go ahead and install it after
analyzing it I found that

252
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,630
it was doing something on my system I
went ahead and did a right Wireshark

253
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,680
capture

254
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,699
and it was in cryptic day two of my
system and sending it off to somebody

255
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,670
outside that was a nice test system so I
wasn't concerned about what it was

256
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,620
sending off

257
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,699
and in this particular I project

258
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,899
I actually figured out what it was
sending off and if you're interested

259
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,290
in in hearing about what this what it
was is a botnet

260
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,490
was doing you can talk to me after after
the stock

261
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,709
art so has that defense ever been used

262
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,800
has somebody said yeah but you're not
going to find now where on my system

263
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,470
and yes I agree my system was used to i
hack

264
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,490
certainly in the end the case apparent
mccaffrey his system both the

265
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,500
prosecution and the defense agree

266
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,550
his system was used to attack I think it
was the Port of Houston

267
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,579
well the case hinged on whether or not
the jury would believe that

268
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:06,149
someone else had taken over his system
and indeed they ended up believing that

269
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:09,730
and he was acquitted

270
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,320
art so the latest project I've worked on

271
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,560
I was I was asked to come in and do a
forensic analysis

272
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,220
I took the prosecutorial report I read
the entire report

273
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,380
and I and I found this quote and I read
this quote and it just didn't seem right

274
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,949
to me

275
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:29,670
the quote is it is unknown if any of
these buyers files were allowed to run

276
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,009
on the system prior to being caught by
the norton antivirus software or

277
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,790
if any of them were in any way
responsible for any other child

278
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,139
pornography files located on the
suspect's computer

279
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,930
if I'm the computer forensic examiner if
I'm the expert

280
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,670
I should know these answers I should be
writing this in new in a report

281
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,980
I should be able to say this these
viruses

282
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,470
infected the system after this
pornography was placed on the system or

283
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,930
before the system was

284
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,959
placed on the system so I went to the
defense attorney I was working for and I

285
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,790
said

286
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,310
I've never really done this if it turns
out that

287
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,220
the malware downloaded this I'm not your
guy

288
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,230
but I can tell you that I'm going to
instantaneously start working on how I

289
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,339
would do this

290
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,680
if I needed to prove it now where was
was the problem

291
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,209
so my latest project is researching

292
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,899
if it is possible cell whether malware

293
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:31,690
or the computer user downloaded files in
question on the system

294
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,399
so I started by going out on the
Internet and there's all kinds of

295
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,870
information on the Internet on how you
might go about

296
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,910
proving whether or not malware download
illegal files on the system

297
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,740
or the computer user downloaded files on
the system but no one I could find

298
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,019
nowhere

299
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:52,500
that someone would tell me I actually
infected a system

300
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,699
and I conducted aka computer forensic
exam

301
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,149
and this these are the steps I talk and
this is how I prove that

302
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:03,220
the malware did it are those of you that
our are big into reading there was a

303
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,829
book a while back called

304
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,869
hackers challenge and that's what
happens challenge did

305
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,110
it gave you all the log files and it
would bring you to

306
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,990
this is what happened in this is how you
could have proved what happened so

307
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,510
that's what I was looking for

308
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,339
I couldn't find that so I decided you're
never gonna send out emails to a bunch

309
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,990
of industry professionals and if I said
their names

310
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,650
that you'd know them and basically I
asked out three questions

311
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,010
first was are you aware of any
documentation that discusses what

312
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,980
downloader malware looks like from

313
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,600
a forensic examiners point of view and
if you do could you tell me where it is

314
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,460
and the other question was if you don't
do think this would be a worthy project

315
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,450
now I was disappointed just like we had
so many people who decided

316
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,799
we're not going to touch this with a
ten-foot pole

317
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,049
I wonder how many of these forensic
examiner said I don't even want to be

318
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,440
involved in this project

319
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,900
and that's why didn't get a response but
of the replies I got

320
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,940
no one could point me to any
documentation so I thought this would be

321
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,750
good documentation to write

322
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,669
ended some respondents thought and that
would be a worthy project

323
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,630
up other respondents that that said I'm
not aware of any that documentation

324
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,720
thought I should do some other project
they said but why do you do this

325
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,309
instead of analyzing I whether malware
or the computer user

326
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,149
project so I worked for college

327
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,510
and normally when I do these projects I
do them on my own

328
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,530
and then I go to college and i say i
would like to present at Def Con I would

329
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,200
like to present at this technology
conference I would like to present I

330
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,809
hope

331
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,168
do you want me to present as independent
researcher Joe Cicero

332
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,970
or northeast with Northeast Wisconsin
Technical College instructor joe says

333
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,510
throw

334
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,289
and always in the past the college's
said now you can do it as a as a

335
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:50,740
employees have nWTC but because I was
going to do this project

336
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,570
on nWTC computer and I would be
installing now where

337
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,850
on in WTC computer which is against
policy

338
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,910
I thought it better that I ask
permission to do this one

339
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,410
so I set off an email to my executive
leadership team that's what yeltsin

340
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,370
stands for

341
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,260
ric rac requesting permission to do this
project I asked them three

342
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,600
simple questions tonight conduct the
research is an nWTC employees

343
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,780
which I always ask after the fact but
this time I was asking

344
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,789
before can I get an exemption to the
Acceptable Use Policy

345
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,150
I'm going to install malware on one of
your computers

346
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,100
which is against Jerry your acceptable
use policy and I need an exemption for

347
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,780
that

348
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,700
and can I publish all the communications
because if I can't publish the

349
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,690
communications

350
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,590
between us that I won't do this project
is an nWTC employees its stock

351
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,030
this is part of the research project if
somebody wants to go on with my research

352
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,539
they might not want to know what the
steps I talk

353
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:50,010
the executive leadership teams response
was

354
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,330
you have the support to go ahead and do
this project

355
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,159
now I want to make it clear all I ask
them for was

356
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,350
I'm going to install Mauer I didn't say
anything about what the malware would do

357
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,970
so they said go ahead with your project
I thought great now I can start

358
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,720
my next call was to the EFSF great
organization if you haven't given

359
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,830
if you've got an extra couple a box just
go down and give it to them

360
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,178
if you got 20 40 60 100 go give it to
them

361
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,850
i cud I I can't say enough about how
nice it is to make a phone call to an

362
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,280
attorney I spent about a half an hour on
the phone with Jennifer Granik

363
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,840
pocket just a wonderful organization so
I'll

364
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,590
I made a phone call %ah one of the first
things I told Jennifer was I haven't

365
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,799
told my executive leadership team that
this malware might download illegal

366
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,090
content like troubled child pornography

367
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,658
and shit the words outta Jennifer smart
where you're going to tell them that

368
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:42,820
right

369
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,240
I said yes but I wanted the I wanted to
back up everything that I was about to

370
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,720
send them an email

371
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,760
what by talking to an attorney first out
that conversation

372
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,549
to primary outcomes came first of all is
that the law

373
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,418
in regards to child pornography States
knowingly

374
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,710
with the regards to possession so as
long as I don't

375
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,610
pick-up become aware up the child
pornography on a system

376
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,520
I haven't broken that law so I could do
a forensic examiner look at an image

377
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,330
I don't need to look at the image i'm
looking at all the meta-data the image

378
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,110
so I thought

379
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,140
that's very easy to do the other thing
that I had not thought about

380
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,880
this is why you discuss those things
these things with attorneys and other IT

381
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,230
professionals was

382
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,539
you should probably address what will
happen yes if you do become

383
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:33,820
aware up the illegal content. they might
have policies and procedures already in

384
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,428
place

385
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:37,970
but they might not so in the event you
become aware

386
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,270
you want to have that in your protocol
that was very important

387
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,309
so after I had that conversation

388
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,460
I did an executive leadership team re
request

389
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,850
I sent it off %uh an email and I said

390
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,799
do you want to revoke my approval based
upon the possibility

391
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,730
that the malware I install on your
computer might download illegal content.

392
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,210
in an example would be child pornography
the second question was

393
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,679
I do you want to review the protocol i
right before I conduct this research so

394
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,210
that there's

395
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,809
other eyes on it and another question
was do you already have policies in

396
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:12,379
place

397
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,710
should someone become aware that are
there's child pornography on a system

398
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,500
I sent that email off to my executive
leadership team and what do you think

399
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,070
happened

400
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,129
I work for a great organization

401
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,890
my executive leadership team said Joe we
back you

402
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,960
and we're going to allow you to proceed
but we're going to do it with caution

403
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,409
how many have you have an employer like
that

404
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:42,690
up yeah I think they do ok

405
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,929
I here's a college you wanna you want to
talk about a college that allows our

406
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,419
instructor some leeway

407
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,490
they didn't say now we're not get
involved with this like all the

408
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,799
attorneys and the

409
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:56,250
I and the Innocence Project here in New
York they said this is a worthy project

410
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,289
and we're gonna just proceed with
caution so what they wanted to do is

411
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:03,549
consult with their own attorney so the
next thing we did and I love meeting

412
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,330
sorry

413
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,158
the Alex but meetings with attorneys are
not on my

414
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,280
high regard here

415
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,049
I we I had a meeting with the

416
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:18,799
I with the attorney now this was very
interesting to me the school's attorney

417
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,720
said you know Joe

418
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,049
courts can lower the standard of
knowingly

419
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:27,600
to should have known and your computer
expert

420
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,820
I can easily see II court saying

421
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,490
mister Cicero you should have known so

422
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,470
we're going to go I'll goal forward with
that understanding

423
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,640
additionally they said you know there
might be safe harbor an exemption there

424
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,179
might be an

425
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:48,120
a safe harbor exemption so we might have
something that we can work what and you

426
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,929
can do this project and we don't really
have to worry about it

427
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,400
are they also said we should talk with
the people we deal with with a night

428
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,460
anti-virus there and I might now where
vendors and we should say hey

429
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,419
how do you guys deal with this because
if it's going on it must happen on your

430
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:04,330
computer's

431
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,539
and there might be a procedure or
protocol already in place for how to

432
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:08,890
handle it

433
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,850
and then they said you know what we're
going to schedule a follow-up meeting

434
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,360
with

435
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,770
another attorney of who does computer
forensics and

436
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:20,590
and get some of his thoughts so the
answers to those key points before that

437
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,570
meeting happen

438
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,700
they couldn't find a safe harbor
exemption the anime our vendors were

439
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,429
unwilling to tell us how they conducted
testing I want you to think about that

440
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,929
its it it happens we know what happens
that

441
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,850
malware whether it's a botnet for an
hour or or virus or trojan or whatever

442
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,240
has downloaded illegal files well that
means that all these

443
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,480
anti-virus vendors have to have systems
where that's happening

444
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,500
they were unwilling to tell us the
protocol that they used to handle when

445
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,220
that happens to them

446
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,510
they contacted other colleges to say do
you have any instructors doing this type

447
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,760
a research and how do you handle it

448
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,779
and the college's got back with are my
college in basically said let us know

449
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,520
how that goes

450
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,210
or are you sure you want to allow this
instructed to do that

451
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,179
so again other colleges really not doing
this type a research

452
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,330
and of course there was a follow-up
meeting schedule now

453
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,960
prior to the follow-up meeting the
attorney that was gonna be called in

454
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,820
to meet with me on the follow-up meeting
said you know what I would have a

455
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,980
meeting before that meeting so now

456
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,510
lucky me I get to have meetings about
meetings

457
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,179
I get called into this meeting and and
this this attorney who's also a forensic

458
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:36,880
examiner said you know what

459
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,710
I will hike would not be able to render
an opinion on this

460
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,850
until I had a formal research proposal

461
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,049
and the protocol written so I looked at
him and I said

462
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:51,570
what do you need in the formal research
proposal in the protocol just tell me

463
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,460
and then that's what I'll write

464
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,760
and he said not all I'm not gonna go for
that's all

465
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,350
so we ended that meeting and I went back
to my office and if I do say so myself I

466
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,220
rather a very nice for more research
proposal

467
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,760
and I started writing the protocol but
what I felt was

468
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,809
I was kinda been a catch-22 I

469
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:13,090
the formal research proposal was easy to
write mean all kinds have

470
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,150
a information in it and sightings

471
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,770
but the protocol every time I thought
about how I do a forensic exam

472
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:26,010
IFI I realize that I do a lot of things
exactly the same

473
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,169
but then what I end up with his new
search leads so

474
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,440
I Titleist new search lead new search
Lee and then I have to go

475
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,690
analyze those new search leads are I saw
this I'm gonna go on a man I'm

476
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,570
find out what happened there and what
the realization I had is

477
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,678
when I write down these new search leads
I'm then going to have to write a new

478
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,029
protocol for them

479
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,630
I'm going to have to submit them to an
attorney I'm gonna have to wait for that

480
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,130
attorney to make a decision

481
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,620
because I can't bury myself from this
protocol

482
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,440
at all this is going to take for ever

483
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,529
I won't be able to conduct this research
in years

484
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:04,980
because it has to then go back to the
executive leadership team

485
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,559
it then has to be approved to come back
to me and it would taste just take for

486
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,789
ever to do this so

487
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:13,640
I basically scrapped the idea of
installing the malware

488
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,120
but I still wanted to conduct my
research so

489
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,070
what's a guy to do K use my own

490
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,370
industry standard malware so

491
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,950
I made the decision rather than writing
my own virus what i'll do is i'll go

492
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,010
find out

493
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,919
how people are doing things like but
Nats learn how to do a botnet

494
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,460
create my own but they had and then I'll
just

495
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,649
upload my own inner images images of
cars

496
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:44,330
and I can still conduct my research cuz
I don't care what the images

497
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,370
I care whether or not you can tell what
put it there the malware

498
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,730
or the computer user so I spent a
considerable on a time

499
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,720
thirty or forty hours learning how to
create a botnet

500
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,059
I was able to create a botnet I'm able
to upload image files now to my Tascam

501
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,049
test computer and my research continues
now I did not I don't have anything

502
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,600
officially written yet

503
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,000
but what I've done so far the evidence
points me

504
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,669
debtor the what I found is that the lack
of evidence

505
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:20,630
is the evidence itself if you find these
images on your system but you don't find

506
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,120
any other relation to that evidence

507
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,470
then it was probably malware that put it
there remember

508
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,340
I i want to be able to analyze a system
and not know whether or not now where

509
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,039
exists

510
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,520
art so why is this going on well if you
go out

511
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,350
a what wire experts having problems with
determining this

512
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,090
well I found this quote on a normal out
on the web there's a two-year time limit

513
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,370
before your soul dies this was an
article I believe it was on forensic

514
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,210
focus

515
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,909
written by a gentleman who deals with
child pornography on a regular basis

516
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,210
and he basically says people who do this
on a daily basis

517
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,279
either after after two years their heart
is black and

518
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,529
they just they can ignore the terrible
things that they see on their screen

519
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:06,640
or they just can't take it anymore

520
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,970
now I want you to think about a forensic
expert

521
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,100
thats prosecuting you or thats thats
dealing with the prosecution

522
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,470
that has less than two years experience

523
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,440
how expert were you when you add less
than two years

524
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,549
experience so that might be one of the
reasons for their previous quote

525
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:30,240
ninety-five percent other other forensic
experts that that gentleman met

526
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,620
were dangerous additionally I found a
quota law enforcement agencies are on a

527
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,960
steep learning curve now way to think
about this I was involved in a case

528
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,990
last year that was Windows

529
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,409
98 so

530
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:48,080
I have to know Windows 98 Windows XP

531
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,510
Windows Vista Windows seven if you're a
small shop

532
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,490
you have to know everything and now
think about how many small

533
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,980
forensic shops for even even even cop
police and forensics

534
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,840
examiner shops there are where there's
one or two guys

535
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,100
are they going to know Linux Macintosh
all the different versions a macintosh

536
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,159
all the intricacies have Vista and 7 XP
in ninety-eight

537
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,029
so law enforcement agencies are on a
steep learning curve

538
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:20,039
art so what's the cost of the defense

539
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,679
there's a there's a cost that goes way
beyond monetary

540
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,480
monetarily a monetary cost are Julia
meryl miscarried her baby

541
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,580
she was hospitalized for stress they can
barely afford to keep their home

542
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,760
her case took four years of her life

543
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,070
this is all over porn popups

544
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,100
are she lost her teaching license and
she lost at least one job

545
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,640
because her employer didn't like her
arrest record

546
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,490
Matthew bandy I was reported that there
was a quarter million dollars in legal

547
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,419
costs

548
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:57,529
he was on probation for 18 months it was
a two-year nightmare

549
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:01,190
Michael Feola he was fired from his job

550
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,490
received death threats this case cost
him a quarter million dollars in fees

551
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,620
they had to liquidate their savings

552
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,820
take a second mortgage sell their car
they lost friends

553
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,370
and what was the what what what what did
I do you remember what I

554
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,899
found out on the web that the

555
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:23,340
prosecutor that that there were two
exams or something like that

556
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,390
that agreed with the different defense
for a forensic exam

557
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,870
this is what it cost him

558
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,240
up there's a cost to the taxpayers to I
want you to think that

559
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,580
that that prosecution is free the
prosecutors that are prosecuting people

560
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,960
they that cost you money others a belief
in the legal system

561
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,760
I think we all probably have our
understanding that

562
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,419
you might get a raw deal if you end up
in the legal system

563
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,510
and then there's the cost that guilty
people go free

564
00:31:54,510 --> 00:32:00,158
up I am NOT in favor of anybody who
deals with child pornography going free

565
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,370
I want them prosecuted

566
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,029
alright so how many of you have a
quarter million dollars for you defense

567
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:08,529
fun

568
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,390
right these people they the they had
that kinda money

569
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,919
up I don't have that kinda money so what
can you do well

570
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,330
defendants gas courts to pay but
sometimes the judge balks at the price

571
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,689
of forensic examiners are not cheap and
Europe a really good attorneys probably

572
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,480
not gonna be

573
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,620
cheap so this is gonna cost you a lot of
money if you're innocent

574
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,460
art so does a problem exist yeah I think
a problem exists

575
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,919
and I think are a way to handle this
problem is is a computer crime Innocence

576
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,320
Project

577
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,678
innocent people are being prosecuted and
convicted

578
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,600
and guilty people are not being punished
they're saying hey them our did it

579
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,789
an incompetent friends prosecutorial
forensic examiner saying I can't defend

580
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:54,129
that may be a dead

581
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,360
and somebody was guilty goes free

582
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,510
if you're in interested in conducting
this type a research hopefully some I

583
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,169
prepper

584
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:05,090
preparation work some like prep work is
done and you don't have to start where I

585
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,010
started

586
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,029
learning all this you can start where I
am didn't say are you I need to get all

587
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,200
these different type thing

588
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,600
to all this different types of
information and

589
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,700
not everyone has the the capability of a
quarter-million dollar defense

590
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,519
I want to thank Alex in South because I
would have been able to talk at this

591
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,340
year's hope

592
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,260
without them I want to thank the hope
not talk selection committee

593
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,990
I want to thank my nWTC executive
leadership team for allowing me to

594
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,210
conduct the research

595
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:37,210
and I want to thank those %uh view who
attended and now will have Alex come up

596
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:53,580
that's about as close as I'm gonna get
to a pile

597
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,899
okay I most the crime we're going to
talk minutes per session

598
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,559
our distribution of child pornography
are I'm citing federal law

599
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,740
the course given that we are a federal
republic there are fifty states out

600
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,079
there that have their own slightly
different rules but

601
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,649
the federal the federal laws in nice
cunt overview

602
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,828
I'm okay when I'm talking about on when
lawyers talk about

603
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:20,300
elements up in action elements of the
crime

604
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,909
each of these has to be met for there to
be a crime

605
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:27,510
so I the child porn law is

606
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,560
you knowingly and knowingly doesn't mean
knowingly

607
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,219
there is a term called constructive
knowledge

608
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,480
which is you should have known given the
given what you knew

609
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,829
that you you were acting in such a way
are you were doing such a thing

610
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,980
up possession is generally a
knowledge-based crime

611
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,500
in that you have to know that you are
holding contraband

612
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,810
I usually the example for constructive
knowledge for is I we talk about drug

613
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,009
offenses is

614
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,500
I'm gonna give you thousand dollars to
take this box

615
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,970
and run it across town and give it if
any

616
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,579
you don't pay a thousand dollars to run
a box across town if it's legitimate

617
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,060
there for you have constructive
knowledge

618
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:14,119
something is wrong okay so you have to
knowingly transport receive distribute

619
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,619
his ass solicit for

620
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,940
offer our duplicate child pornography

621
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,540
and it has two for federal law has to
use

622
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,380
are effect interstate commerce now

623
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,349
the Internet is interstate commerce even
when

624
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:38,540
it is two machines in the same state

625
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,029
ob because our explain later

626
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,359
up actually it's because that the rule
is if it can affect interstate commerce

627
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,529
it is if it it affects the fed's it
affects the it fits the interstate

628
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,599
commerce clause in the Constitution

629
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,660
and we because the federal government
allowed to

630
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,920
are regulate interstate commerce
eighty-five to 90 percent of federal

631
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,890
laws

632
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,250
base are based out of that clause so

633
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,329
interstate drug laws firearms laws

634
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:11,560
arm help tobacco in explosives were just

635
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,609
you know to the whole that the whole
agency arm

636
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:18,799
cut step at that one clots

637
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,030
okay so what is child porn

638
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,130
I child pornography means any visual
depiction

639
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,000
including photograph film/video Bob so
basically an image

640
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,550
out where the production of the visual
depiction

641
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,710
is a minor in sexually explicit conduct

642
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:42,020
and great I'm

643
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,740
basically it's its sexually explicit
conduct is used in the image

644
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,839
are the image is Ulf and I i was tryna

645
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,890
work a hypo where I have a cardboard box

646
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,960
inside as a child being molested and
it's a photograph of the box would that

647
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,099
be child porn

648
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:01,300
and then it's like why my talking about
this it's never gonna happen

649
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,619
okay but all these go to

650
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:07,720
sexually explicit conduct

651
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,839
what is that and I've read numerous
cases where they discussed this in Sec

652
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:16,480
I'm gonna sum this up as arm well you
know what's actually

653
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,329
it you know it when you see it are it
does not have to be

654
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:23,660
actual sex it could be just a pose that
is

655
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,759
sexy I II when I teach a class in in
computer crime

656
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,619
are I will often show pictures of fun a
child beauty pageants

657
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:37,460
and say is this child porn because you
know there's an image of a kid

658
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,930
and I don't know many four-year-olds
that look like I i

659
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,598
dancers at at Las Vegas Review that's
not normal

660
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,800
and is that an exhibition at the
genitals is that

661
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,700
sexy okay

662
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,760
thankfully they came out with a nice
long past to determine whether or not in

663
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,890
image of a child

664
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:02,060
is child pornography called dost

665
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,070
notice it's really very weak because
it's week we

666
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,089
we balance all these factors to
determine whether not

667
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:11,390
this image his child pornography

668
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,089
now how many people have seen nude
photos of themselves when they were a

669
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:17,670
child

670
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,089
okay is that child pornography

671
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:28,089
probably Wed

672
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,089
not necessary under the law now of
course I going to get to this step

673
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:37,200
as we've seen before just because this
is a defense doesn't mean it's not cheap

674
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,740
to get to this point where you're
debating this

675
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,720
in fact that's hideously expensive cuz
you have expert stalling over

676
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,410
is the image the focus of this image is
it meant

677
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,319
to 21 I'm excite the prurient interests
are secure

678
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,869
is it a picture for kid in a bathtub

679
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:00,050
so what REALLY isn't child pornography
under the law

680
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,150
arm young-looking actors or actresses

681
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,540
and you look for the 2257 see of
approval

682
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,930
out 2257 is the well those of you who

683
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:15,319
look at pornographic web sites arm may
notice that there's an 18 USC 2257

684
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,829
will rule on bonham it's a registry of
everyone who appeared in this

685
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:23,980
if you saw their junk we have their
names

686
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,450
arm animate is not child pornography

687
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,369
on it could be obscene and us a legal
anyway but

688
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,750
it is not inherently child porn on

689
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,960
photoshopping is not a holy generated
computer image

690
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,180
it is if I use a child's head on an
adult body doing something

691
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,589
that is still child porn because there's
a that you can you can point to a

692
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:48,200
child's

693
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,550
image in the photo on

694
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,810
your baby photos are not missus are not
child porn least I hope not because the

695
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,490
focus in the intent the photo was not to
get a one-off

696
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,760
if they were I'm really really sorry

697
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,710
and Sears catalogs I make this is not
actually a joke

698
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,260
arm child porn case I worked on arm

699
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,920
they cited my guy

700
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,450
for images of child porn several which
were

701
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,119
from like eight mid-seventies Sears
catalog of

702
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,550
kids in underwear and sick but wait a
minute this is packed because you like

703
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,710
and i'm talking to friends the French
person other side

704
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,319
and he saying well it's it's a scan data
the sears catalog

705
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,460
okay how such child pornography any

706
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,589
wouldn't answer me okay so how do you
defend

707
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:45,299
against a child porn case you can attack
the elements

708
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,530
knowledge I didn't know the child forms
they are all

709
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,270
and therefore he did not legally possess
you had it but you can legally possess a

710
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,829
cuz you didn't know it existed

711
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:59,240
on your hard drive you didn't know was
real child porn you thought I just read

712
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,300
your tentacle porn

713
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,750
arm you didn't know style pornography

714
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,680
it was it's an you know it's sad it's an
image I mean that's on an image it's

715
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,589
like i dinos

716
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:13,470
it was I thought was regular porn I you
can defend on

717
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,710
yes I knew the porn was there bite no
actual children were used

718
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,869
in the manufacture of this I'm

719
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:24,849
now under federal law there's this
unconstitutional rule that says

720
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,280
its up to you to prove that they aren't
actually children

721
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,290
this is unconstitutional I don't know if
it's been tested yet

722
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,160
because it's the prosecution's a

723
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,740
burden to show all the elements so you
have to show

724
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,270
you knew you had it you knew as a child

725
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,839
and that the are actually children

726
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,980
the they switch this in federal law to
say

727
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,250
you have to raise the defense you have
to inform us before

728
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,589
you raise it and it's your burden to me

729
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:02,680
now the problem is how do you prove

730
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,310
that the chop that their that the image
is not that of a child you would have to

731
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,400
either name the child where and it's
really their defense for the

732
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,170
pornographer

733
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,890
because it's a well you know here's
here's all our 2257 numbers

734
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,150
that paper since nineteen therefore
we're OK

735
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,020
but for the person charged with
consuming or possessing it's really hard

736
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,210
to try and find the name of the person

737
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,690
so you instead have to do a a

738
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,920
an expert witness to say that's you know

739
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,040
that's not a that's not an that's an
adult that's not a kid

740
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,540
because you know proportion height
waihee

741
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,490
you know breast development whatever
there's also

742
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,940
this really strange good faith
affirmative defense which

743
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,210
seems to be a cut out for people who arm

744
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,210
are IT people can

745
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:59,829
actions at large a significant block if
I've child porn arrests

746
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:02,839
come out I love people working arm

747
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:08,759
at Best Buy are are are other retail
computer outlets because

748
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,869
person with child porn comes in saying
my machine doesn't work

749
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:16,740
I'm I have Ben that IT guy not with
child porn but

750
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,690
my computer isn't working what's wrong
with its cuz it's chock full of porn

751
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,589
you know there there is no space for
swap any markets all porn

752
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:29,400
that's why you can't burn a CD there's
no space left delete some if you're born

753
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,069
sir

754
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,190
I didn't leave that on the message to
his wife that would awesome

755
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,530
but forearm

756
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,770
for the affirmative defense though I'm

757
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,569
you can help you must be you love you
are identified

758
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:49,609
less than three images so you get two
bites

759
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:52,890
and back point you've either delete made

760
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,549
made reasonable effort to delete those
those documents

761
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,530
are you have prevented anyone else
reviewing them

762
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,430
and if and have called the cops and you
only permit the police to say

763
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:09,060
so it's effectively saying I don't have
it I'm stepping away from the PC

764
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,828
I'm not touching anything I I yeah I
kept everyone else

765
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:15,940
at the lab are out of I know I i'm

766
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,200
at the shop waiting for the cops to iraq
if

767
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,140
%uh which is why generates a few things
just deleted I made reasonable efforts

768
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,060
to delete it

769
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,549
gone and maybe then call the cops

770
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,710
maybe not I'm not really sure they're
really depends on

771
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,890
whether or not the police already now

772
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:38,848
okay another way of defending the child
porn cases you attack the evidence

773
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:42,319
the way he collected was was bogus the
way you

774
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,050
analyzed it was bogus your conclusions
are broken

775
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,050
on this is a tooling expert problem each
side

776
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:57,150
has their forensics expert each side is
caring apart the other persons report

777
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,520
each side is is and then the problem
with this

778
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,160
is one it's expensive cuz you just build
your friend six-person out for a bunch

779
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,970
hours

780
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,560
they build their salads

781
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,859
and you're going to if you actually go
to a jury trial

782
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:16,750
you're gonna have that person in a in
the witness box

783
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:21,240
for anywhere from day to a week

784
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,880
ever wanted jury watching really
detailed technical evidence

785
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,490
five-minute rule if it's more than five
minutes there sleep

786
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,579
I've watched jurors fall asleep during
this sec

787
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,670
so really unless you've

788
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,050
unless you have a expert witness that's
interesting enough they're gonna listen

789
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,050
are they crack jokes and really i cant

790
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:48,990
I look for good job porn jokes there
just aren't any stock material

791
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,920
I'm not me okay just to be safe because
I know this can be a DVD in this will be

792
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,400
you know brought up in some disciplinary
action later with the bar

793
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,119
on I am in no way making light of child
porn

794
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,010
very very serious bad

795
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,530
that's as well I can be sincere okay so
experts how

796
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:12,390
are we experts how do we how do we
promise how do we put you forward

797
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,710
are someone foreign say I'm a computer
forensics expert

798
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,220
arm you have to be an expert and under
US law

799
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,359
you have to be have to have specialized
skill training

800
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,970
our experience you can be a expert
witness about cars

801
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,060
and you say well-served how are you an
expert

802
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:35,299
way home I've spent working as a car
mechanic for 18 years

803
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,359
here my certifications here's where I've
worked

804
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:41,450
bang you can then be put forward as an
expert

805
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,920
the way this is done is side that wants
to push you forward as an expert

806
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,920
asked to certify we won a certified Bob

807
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,630
each side can kinda call will question
the person

808
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,660
arm now it's not just the expert

809
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,109
is is put on on cast experts feel

810
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:04,430
is put on a test to say is this actually
a field of expertise

811
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:08,609
is it relevant to our cakes so

812
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:11,690
putting forward you note the automotive
expert going

813
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:14,790
that's great but we're talking about
child porn the fact that you know the

814
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,319
times when the Buick in a shabby

815
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,490
irrelevant here go away now

816
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:23,089
the advantages once you get certified as
an expert field it's really really easy

817
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:24,900
cuz judge you know judges will say

818
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,160
well no judge someone selling the you
know in the Western District certified

819
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:29,609
you

820
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:33,529
good enough for me

821
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:38,170
okay I'll quickly go through the
standards for experts

822
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,359
the dobare standard is they test

823
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,710
if they test the science which is is a
test tube or is our

824
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,829
error rate is there some way of
determining that

825
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:51,660
you have done a method that's acceptable
and you've done it correctly

826
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,910
and you know the chances that you
screwed it up

827
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:59,149
how accepted is it how many times has it
been

828
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,500
Don arm and has that mimic

829
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,569
correctly applied to the case at hand so
your

830
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:11,390
you what theory you're putting forward
is it has ever been done before

831
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,680
I there's also no order stand which we
call the fry standard its

832
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,970
a lot looser its is a general scientific
acceptance of the field

833
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,920
up the method you used and why almost
there law review article about how fry

834
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,800
is stupid

835
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,230
all that its the law in Penn State's

836
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,900
including New York Pennsylvania
California so it's still really really

837
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,309
important

838
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:40,200
okay um I've seen a couple cases where
the use experts in child porn

839
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,960
one is arm proving that the images are
of children

840
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,440
and there's still kinda broke into some
some states like

841
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,839
you don't need an expert to prevent I
can see that their kids their kids

842
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:53,930
don't need to put it but someone forward
others are

843
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:57,029
know you actually have to go through
some a bunch hoops

844
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,710
about it which is I've doctor who

845
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,500
evidently their specialty is determining
whether not be poor kids

846
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,829
beware specialty but hey

847
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:11,640
okay I am prosecution

848
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,558
when they put forth their expert they're
putting forward I'm explaining what I

849
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,550
did I'm explaining what I saw

850
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,240
and if the really good they're going to
foreclose potential defense is that the

851
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,290
defense would possibly

852
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,420
raise arm usually they don't tell

853
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,890
usually they're just like this is this
is the truth came from God

854
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:32,730
to me to you corset and screw it up I'm
not going to discuss what they might

855
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,800
argue the defense's jobs come up with
alternext nation for the fax

856
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,720
are to critique and say he didn't get
the facts

857
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,250
and one quick aside before I sit back
down arm

858
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,210
child porn cases are different in about
the evidence any other case

859
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,579
the defense gets all the evidence the
prosecution has and they can go and

860
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:54,010
collect more

861
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,170
in child porn because

862
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:01,349
child porn itself is illegal to have you
can't just give it over

863
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:04,410
to the defense and say there you go

864
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:07,549
because it's true more that would make
the prosecutor

865
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,599
distributor child porn that would make
you assessor

866
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:14,369
child porn mister missus forensic expert

867
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:17,700
Fed's came up with a really bizarre rule
which is

868
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,849
its to use my hands the prosecution you

869
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:24,130
forensic expert go to the FBI field lab

870
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,660
use their equipment and

871
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,078
um we promise we won't listen in when
you're talking to the lawyer

872
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,859
are if the lawyers there and I don't
know I've I get a little

873
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:38,808
it she ran cops I can imagine talking
with my forensic expert being the

874
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,670
forensic expert talking to the lawyer

875
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,000
and select officer friendly would you
mind not listening into our defense

876
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,119
strategy

877
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,470
I'll be really nice however

878
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,480
I've seen with this is also helped the
defense in a really odd way

879
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,270
arm I worked on the new

880
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,690
I New Jersey versus year Lauren Series
Case this was

881
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,210
a oMG I got caught up in a perverted
justice kindness

882
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,230
kind of staying he had child porn are

883
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,910
he allegedly had child porn on his hard
drive when we raise the defense to say

884
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,190
we want to see the forensic analysis we
want to see how it was done

885
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,740
and we wanna see the images to determine
whether or not the child porn

886
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,589
prosecution said and gamers can leave it
as some

887
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:26,170
you know attempted child molestation
screw the child porn and ink kinda had a

888
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,780
guy dead to rights anyway

889
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:37,780
of

890
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,910
I don't have any slight so I'm just
going to it's a couple things

891
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:49,450
I'm one thing is that I don't have a lot
of first-hand experience with

892
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,839
working on this issue with the FF one
reason is that

893
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:57,420
until BFF relatively recently hired
Jennifer Granik

894
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,150
was really one of the world's leading
computer crime defense lawyers

895
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,250
BFF had never undertaken any criminal
defense if anyone

896
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,000
we have a large legal team but their
expertise was all

897
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,900
civil litigation and so we just had a
policy that we don't do criminal cases

898
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,040
now that we have jennifer working with
us we are able to do some criminal

899
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,400
representation

900
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,300
so that's really cool but it's really
recent development for FF actually

901
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,680
I'm in the past we always had to refer
all the criminal cases to other people

902
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,450
outside of our organization

903
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,210
but the other thing is that still
because we are a non-profit and we have

904
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:38,950
so I'm

905
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,400
so much work so little boyer time

906
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,180
we try to do you generally a strategy
called impact litigation

907
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,140
where we try to do things that will set
an important precedent it's also the

908
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,078
strategy that ACLU generally uses

909
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,290
I'm and that means to try to economize
or lawyers resources

910
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:59,230
we generally try not to get involved in
cases where we think there's going to be

911
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,079
a big factual dispute

912
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,260
where the sides will have to fight back
and forth about what happened we

913
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,730
generally try to get involved in cases
where

914
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,880
it's pretty clear what happened I'm

915
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,710
and there's a dispute about the law
what's legal standard that applies to

916
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,059
this and we've tried to set a precedent
about that

917
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:20,550
so that's not really what we're talking
about on this panel so it's a little

918
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,970
unusual as far as our experience over a
DFF

919
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:27,819
I have to say that the malware defense
issue

920
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:32,190
for the idea that what you think you
found on my computer

921
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,579
isn't really something that I did
because computers are in secure

922
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,000
is really not something that's limited
to child porn cases

923
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,329
I consulted on a case in Brazil

924
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:47,589
a.m. it was actually a criminal case
about defamation

925
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:52,328
it sounds really weird in the US legal
context but in Brazil

926
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,780
defamation can be a criminal offence and
you can go to prison

927
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:00,109
for defamation and I consulted on a case
where the defendant

928
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:04,420
was presenting this defense that someone
else had done it

929
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,180
and that perhaps their computer was
infected with malware and that they

930
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,480
hadn't actually

931
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,920
rid the allegedly defamatory things that
they were being threatened with prison

932
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,369
time

933
00:54:12,369 --> 00:54:15,619
for having written and

934
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:19,680
the difficulty which is very typical is
that they couldn't afford a forensic

935
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,660
examination

936
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,828
on the defense side I'm so the
prosecutor had done

937
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:28,220
head contracted for forensic examination

938
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,730
the defendant was fairly well-off but
even so couldn't really afford the fees

939
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,800
that the forensic examiners would have

940
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,890
charged and I think

941
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:43,160
in all countries around the world
certainly in the United States

942
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,940
this is a real problem both the
panelists have mentioned that

943
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,059
proper forensic work can be extremely
expensive

944
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:53,380
criminal defendants typically don't have
the resources

945
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,970
to go through with that whether it's a
child porn matter or any other kind of

946
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,760
criminal defense matter

947
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,720
and so in that case I was looking at a
report basically

948
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,470
I'm as in the cases that were mentioned
before

949
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,339
the forensic examiners said well we
think that this person wrote this stuff

950
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:13,578
because we found the stuff on their
computer and

951
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:17,950
we didn't find any particular reason to
think that they didn't write it

952
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,839
there wasn't any report on the other
side so ultimately the person was

953
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:23,430
convicted

954
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,880
one of the difficulties there I think
was that the court had a difficult time

955
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,720
understanding why

956
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,150
someone would have written malware that
would have put this material

957
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,299
on the defendant's computer if the
defendant had written it

958
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:40,030
like what's the motive to put the thing
on the person's computer

959
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,530
I'm and I think to varying degrees in
different cases

960
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:46,750
that's the difficulty that courts have
with the concept of

961
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:50,250
malware you can say that computers are
incredibly insecure and they've been

962
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,280
infected

963
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,500
left and right and people have malware
and spyware and adware and viruses and

964
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,430
botnets

965
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,040
but why did they put the thing on the
computer of course one possibility is

966
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,339
that someone's using the computer as

967
00:56:01,339 --> 00:56:04,920
storage cloud storage super cheap cloud
storage really

968
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,119
arm your dollars per gig

969
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,809
another possibility is that someone is
intentionally trying to frame someone

970
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:14,200
and I guess there are other
possibilities yet

971
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,369
arm but basically I think the economics
are

972
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:21,180
a real challenge for getting forensic
work done we were talking just before

973
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,540
the panel about

974
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:27,960
the issue that a cursory examination

975
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,750
might find files on a computer without
really establishing how the files got

976
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,890
there

977
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,970
one point that we're talking about is
that website

978
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:40,660
crude inline images that would never
even be displayed to user

979
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,980
arm skill them to one pixel by one pixel

980
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,400
me to do this from JavaScript maybe do
this in an iframe

981
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,260
I and then the images and up in someones
cash and a forensic examiner could be

982
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,240
trained to always look through someone's
browser cache

983
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,720
and they might find the images and say
work I found these images in the browser

984
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,540
cache

985
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,640
unless it could be true that the user
never intentionally downloaded them and

986
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,670
they were never actually

987
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:08,619
displayed rendered in the browser user
interface in with user could see them

988
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:12,240
and so a challenge is thats arm

989
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,440
as the other panelists have mentioned we
don't necessarily have

990
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,329
standards in forensics examination that
would

991
00:57:20,329 --> 00:57:24,150
it make it clear what a forensics
examiner needs to do you

992
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:27,390
to establish intent to establish

993
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,098
how these images came to be there
whether they were displayed to the user

994
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:32,839
whether the user attempted to download
them

995
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:38,490
and so on and I think that challenge is
a challenge for forensics in general

996
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:43,579
computers are very complex beasts

997
00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:47,020
it's not just something about one kind
of criminal case but something about the

998
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,460
forensics profession as a whole

999
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,910
we got a lot of calls over the FF people
in a lot of trouble

1000
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:58,000
they need help they don't have money so
I think this panel has just identified

1001
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,030
another way in which the process of
getting people a fair trial can be

1002
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:07,890
quite difficult thanks

1003
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:12,069
having of

1004
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:17,960
couple a minutes for questions if
anybody has any questions

1005
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,990
you're all afraid is as the attorneys we
ask

1006
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,829
alright well thank you have a great help

1007
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:29,869
I want to say that the a panelist can be
available outside the

1008
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:33,309
outside the room here about where the
DVD's are made for a few minutes if you

1009
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,530
wanna talk to them privately

1010
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,589
on so thanks to come
