1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,570
actually not as good times as a resource
sleep I think doctor

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,850
you're up for the talks not important
part good quick announcement I wanted to

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,240
make

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,509
of 5 o'clock vere was sniper friends ex
Park has been cancelled

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,000
it's actually can be replaced by the
white man talks on the way he talks will

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,869
be in here

7
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:23,230
Lovelace are 5 o'clock tonight also
mentioned for our amateur radio

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,619
exams going on now are done ima on the
sixth floor

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,359
I think these go until about one o'clock
information about them

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,730
is in the program so that said

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,930
mom GPS some pretty cool stuff

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,329
as far as i'm concerned. are it's just
some magic that

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,140
tells me where I need to go and I'm
staring down at my screen on my your

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,160
GPS my car it turns out there's actually
a little bit more to learn

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,440
and now Caceres you're gonna give us
really interesting details in

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,160
in not only on how GPS works but really
starting to

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,609
talk about had actually interact with
the data comes out a GPS

18
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:08,380
from maximum

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,869
my newscasts learned chairman-elect UN's
year

20
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,570
I give a similar dogs a Trenton computer
for stallone

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,799
couple years ago hands and I
correspondent was burned the SM he may

22
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,320
some

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,350
very nice it s since sanctions for
modified to talk for sounds

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,970
is bad and yes hearings audience yeah
okay

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,110
how I think he deserves a round about
flowers

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,479
%ah Kb

27
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,520
United this is my business card I puts
my

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,740
card in its own it so people can find

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,829
I do a family but the sense she emailed
to jihadis am showing here

30
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:57,040
who worked at Monmouth dot com I would
gladly send you a copy absurd view

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,280
graphs has put into the subject line

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,310
times 90ps stalkers homes

33
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,310
as in going to the trash

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,160
first said we

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,900
talk outline hours I would give user
general specifications 72

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,680
GPS with tacos about a different

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,980
kinds have GPS units how

38
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,730
and if when if the important things I
want to show you is how you

39
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,500
how you are part to believe you need to
order to catch a unique

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,240
figures have drums in clock information
from the satellites where you really I

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,680
Tim Hudak a literally owe you some GPS
for high

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,140
Kenyan for geocache and what's in the
future

43
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,370
is somehow I

44
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,630
whom he faring to GPS a lag the last one

45
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,920
then learn how to use them out how to
use a compass

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,920
you wait for the rescuers now is the
basic design

47
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,700
we have GPS develop

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,840
died Department of Defense we also have
said

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,790
long mass man developed by the National

50
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,380
federation which was so the market bond
now D

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,950
with some extra satellites for 10 Jack
10 11 Sat lies

52
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,580
out apt 221 and taxes and the Sensei

53
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,590
gave you a she very sad said fun Tuesday
to

54
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,050
put these dogs Susan so they can I slow
cages dog

55
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:02,750
however damn I don't think that too many
reasons a few receivers for glonass

56
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,240
but said no term up to an American man

57
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,510
consumer type standards toussaud's Oh
God

58
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,700
video system and develop my dear
European Union

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,920
which is in development stage she when
it was a problem self

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,210
GPS is that it's operated by im

61
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,080
did the Department of Defense and he was
a very few that I

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,880
turning it off in case have any conflict
him

63
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,180
his ass no signal so calm so

64
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,660
bases give 24 satellites seem

65
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,020
he-man twelve-hour are bits it's about
20,000 kilometers from

66
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,849
from hours and so on twelve-hour RB
twenty-four satellites usually every

67
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,070
for dirt five satellites interview on
Sat time sometimes

68
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,979
have to six or seven depends on where
you are

69
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:03,690
and and to specific now time off today

70
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,100
two justices said that more or less to
scare you CJ arson

71
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,280
and went to satellites are solangi about

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,370
tears to diameter is them

73
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,500
soon 6,000

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,539
for to you train about 6,000 kilometers

75
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,700
diameter years and here we have about
20,000 kilometers

76
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,300
had two heart beat so two-shot nights is
sad

77
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,300
act is horrendous numbers satellite
which arson background

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,369
now he said Jim main operating modes
have the GPS is GM

79
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:54,599
precise mode used by season and by Jim

80
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,019
Department of Defense him some federal
agencies

81
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,469
it so soon qua

82
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:07,039
to resistant to jam to civilian Mon

83
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,219
he said used to be very inaccurate

84
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:13,449
Mt puts it in the facts factors

85
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,449
scarred selective availability and

86
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,899
president clinton decided one day to
hand which

87
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:25,459
I'm and select if I remembered it let's
make it useful for

88
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:31,830
everybody should the current precision
up the civilian system is about the same

89
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,748
has so often military system except its

90
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:40,039
him prone to jamming X backed

91
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,318
normal come and in normal conditions

92
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,479
it's it's quite precise at about

93
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,889
10 meters accuracy nazar

94
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,929
two modes nazar two modes are hen

95
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:58,499
2 a.m. names differential mode

96
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:03,629
and say phase comparison most useful
surveying

97
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,219
on soon vein for surveying you can get
them

98
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:12,429
accuracy switch could go down to
centimeters really

99
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:17,319
them cm the financial markets was quite

100
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,869
see popular be farts is dispatch factor
was removed

101
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:26,969
currently it is have no doesn't give you
an extra precision

102
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,669
am since a few years said a new mod was
added

103
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:39,068
said weas and practically on new
receivers have his capability

104
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,979
and Zack capital of geosynchronous
satellites

105
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,699
whenever the SCO's 10 visit Wesco Coast

106
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,999
hi to be geosynchronous seen as a wrist
revision arbatov

107
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:56,029
24 hours you need 10 arbatov about

108
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:59,169
to 50,000 kilometers to consume

109
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,558
twice as high his as a twenty-four
satellites

110
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:09,550
I did gives you some extra precision
zones are some ground station

111
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,550
which to which I'm have your system will
respond

112
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,909
now this is M pad to which

113
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:27,759
in a few skids a hot dog to this is the
most important part of my

114
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,849
dog how you determined to positional
vertigo

115
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,598
how you have extremely precise clocks

116
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,449
on two satellites Shaw to be determined
cesium clocks which

117
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:45,779
are to it in like one sec games three
hundred years

118
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,630
kisses accuracy in addition sad being
controlled from the ground

119
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,199
says how I switch in Han fume

120
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:58,139
nanosecond Sotirios time and CM

121
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:05,139
says satellites and signal switch had
received by you to GPS say you need

122
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,750
and its SS now its you have no clock

123
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,670
one minute being have no clock domain
that's being

124
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,009
and denied they should do it says
satellites and

125
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:23,870
to as it can serve information someone
is the clock information centers some

126
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,339
so-called

127
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,720
FML this information which gives precise

128
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,250
location of each satellites

129
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,610
day specific time soon if you get if

130
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,410
coming over astronomy if you know if
Emery service starting in no way to ice

131
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,370
is where its

132
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,000
where is his sis when it arises when it
goes down

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,559
and where it is said any precise time

134
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,779
during its passage hun sky

135
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:57,899
handing that issue get almanac
information

136
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,209
which give said the shin which

137
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,730
as you uses said with music clock is

138
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,660
not working on a reef if to something
wrong quits in with your

139
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,189
satellite and disinformation is

140
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:16,769
received by your by your GPS unit

141
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,040
sahnoun that's it to make things simple
they assuming

142
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,589
just too sad stew satellite seen any
change

143
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,660
and she added 24,000

144
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,839
kilometer sub-par now it's three hundred

145
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,519
thousand kilometers per second fiscal
response to a

146
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,339
the milliseconds K now you measure

147
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:48,299
you you check you compared to a clock
since that time signal coming from

148
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,169
satellite why I'm

149
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:54,339
which this second with a time signal in
your review need

150
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,000
and you find its ninety milliseconds
compared to

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,899
the clock signal coming from satellite
to do you do you need

152
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,169
and you find its them

153
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:12,459
it said his 60 milliseconds to ninety
plus 60 is 150

154
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:16,779
no de ti so what's what's a reason for
that reason is that your

155
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:20,549
local clock you saw by an

156
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:23,549
would be a

157
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,959
89 to the song by

158
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,919
him 75 milliseconds

159
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:36,319
CV now subtract from 90 75 height 75
millisecond you come

160
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,399
which 55 from

161
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,639
6235 25

162
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,000
so if you he just your local clock

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,179
by 35 milliseconds

164
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,290
San to distance would be correct

165
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,669
matthew is now you know you clogs

166
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:03,329
your local clock is readjusted and now
you know that you are

167
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,220
55 damn sorry hand which is

168
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,179
16 and a half thousand kilometers from
one sideline

169
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,549
and 25 times 375

170
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:17,639
100 kilometers from Zaza satellite so
you can

171
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,600
exactly determine your position on
signal of notice

172
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,740
I just made the simple it's a
two-dimensional

173
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,360
two-dimensional track nation shirt off

174
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,380
English US vs three things and

175
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,130
in the reality you need for him you

176
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,199
need at least four satellites to

177
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:45,089
to give you time signals saw from for
satellites you will get boasts in

178
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,309
position on the globe and your hide

179
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,040
about few ham

180
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,439
time now to see them

181
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,660
so here I showed jurors them

182
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,889
should PDF what I was saying

183
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,500
here here's a little picture which shows
said so on

184
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,679
basically you you get your clock signals
from

185
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,870
from satellites you note widget
satellites I

186
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,910
you know what the satellite's position
is and from geez you can get a knife

187
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,130
how we made our fast your local clock is

188
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,600
good justice stock o'clock now if you
know

189
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,730
you taking out a difference between your
precise

190
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:37,000
satellite your precise knock knock used
as three hundred thousand kilometers per

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,399
second speed

192
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,519
and you know exactly where you are in a
relation to two satellites

193
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,669
hands FFM a race information issue we're
just satellites higher

194
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:53,519
newest spec to to jurors for now you
know where you out in two years

195
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,669
who dis is basic self to satellite

196
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:02,380
navigation

197
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,250
now to have various sources of error and
there soon I seem to

198
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,490
them to sing are coming into

199
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,689
and when is a major source is a manner

200
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:18,079
is said his urine signaled bounces
descent

201
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,209
ham Jack to frequency currently being
used

202
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:24,919
1.2 gig and it's an 1.5 on prime

203
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,089
its kind and one is to 21.5 you see

204
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,760
is used by the military you use it and
one which is from one point to give you

205
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,029
a heads from one point to give parents
is about to our

206
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:42,939
25 centimetres sewing this gives you
some feeling

207
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:46,709
House is signaling proper propagate how
it will be

208
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,789
reflected from various ham

209
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:57,100
from buildings from surfaces

210
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,630
and seldom to to know exactly where

211
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:07,669
hand where you at warehouses Signum
pound

212
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:10,720
con connects to you you have to

213
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,789
make a model of its it rapport Spears
who is a signal has to pass and as some

214
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,240
had earlier seen it

215
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,640
in fact if you do some hiking through

216
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,049
Swarts who receives it is sir which can
nap you may be owned by a fifty meters

217
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:28,850
for 250 meters

218
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,959
13 open terrain you are with him five to
10 meters

219
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,059
she she said to various sources a manner

220
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,850
now s you can adjust your room

221
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,730
your day time signal your local time
signal

222
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,429
extremely accurately through just super
precise clocks on the satellite

223
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:56,240
and can be used for synchronizing
networks

224
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,539
and to synchronize networking me am

225
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:04,730
that she hoped in HS for air few
milliseconds spices signal inside

226
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,829
d can be used for crypto Gadhafi for

227
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:13,699
passing information at the very specific
time

228
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:18,169
various and not so applications for

229
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:24,079
really precise time information which
can be

230
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,130
received should quit everywhere

231
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,000
un siglo

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,640
now GPS interactivity cm

233
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,029
season am number one

234
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:44,270
this lol good have a kid 20,000
kilometers in

235
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,399
Jr's are zones in clocks and moving

236
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm JM satellites moving quite fast

237
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,699
twelve-hour RB around here cars

238
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:00,579
so I just affect said time signal you
probably hard to know if somebody would

239
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:01,890
call on you to speed up

240
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,449
like he would to stay

241
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,980
10 min young d said actually measurable
effects

242
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,149
and symposia 10

243
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:18,610
special relativity theory and said
general relativity theory affects their

244
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,689
clocks

245
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,140
and she actually get the job state
fordice effects from taking down

246
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,649
sheen admission to the satellites same

247
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:30,659
Department of Defense has a number of

248
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:36,130
stations which communicates which is
satellite images made his cage as the

249
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,110
Clarks

250
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,960
sense ephemeris information on my Mac
information

251
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,960
it's in this area they 22 users

252
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,210
had was showing today said document
48-page document

253
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,220
which refer to which am

254
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,750
using and back offered by the Department
of Defense which

255
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,399
explains exactly what's how to activate
its theory

256
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:12,890
affects the time seems

257
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,700
now won once you get to YouTube position

258
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,860
and keep you have a sequence of
positions enough cause your speed

259
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,279
and unit part W Nate's have have

260
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,039
have man ok and so fair little
computational

261
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,120
programs so you you'd say will convert

262
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,350
his position to that the 22 longitude

263
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,980
into GA you TM if you are

264
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,840
doing some work which them where you
would want to know exactly distances

265
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,970
in you TM is idea because it

266
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,049
game both east west north south each
unit is one meter

267
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:58,200
wearing when you going uses Sacaton

268
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,640
to that it didn't longitude cuz when you

269
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,730
going long-term going onto longitude

270
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,230
one second is it's a by manages one
nautical

271
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,179
how one there my non sequitur backed

272
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:18,510
it goes to 0 new nodes you to Paulos

273
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,908
words in notes I would say launch a not
the duties

274
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:26,950
the same second this is second with you
music poner

275
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,390
equator a tu Compu distances

276
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,029
me get a little complicated

277
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:38,630
so I'm once you have to reading self you
to position

278
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,110
cuz you get speed divides them

279
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,990
just as bad time months ago to

280
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,960
to speed you get then position you can

281
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,289
and now plan now decide where you are
going to you can get said that action

282
00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:00,640
get heading marrying hunting formation
required for

283
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,140
navigation by followed by Keiron and by

284
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,240
by a hike

285
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
now in how okay quickly about the
different types of

286
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,460
for have GPS you hand has you

287
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,049
watch you on Etsy him

288
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:25,429
on the jet ascap luv years Chicago units
became

289
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:30,929
why to resume be prize he used to be a
seven thousand dollars how you can get

290
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,610
one

291
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:39,169
couple hundred dollars

292
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,320
sedans and sanyo zio Hampshire survey

293
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,168
and surveyor types which

294
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:49,830
hand night you talk about 100 s how
surveyor

295
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,049
top you go talk about 10,000 and the
military has

296
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:57,210
known 90 of GPS units

297
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,480
and god only knows how much 22 DeCoste

298
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,140
to you soon they've built in
cryptography it is

299
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,990
and systems and so if I don't know when

300
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:14,990
remember the crack

301
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,559
how decides in Maine futures have GPS
receivers

302
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,320
your Identive panel in the inputs you
can get to a

303
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,750
to hand 215 satellites

304
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,360
and the same time your some have

305
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,380
fam you can get

306
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,940
to him depending on to costs to you have
door-to-door communication you have

307
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,940
your fair Spain left-right Twitter

308
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,970
sorry

309
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:04,200
them varies them new

310
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,059
genuine hey to make sure him do you can
start

311
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:13,160
waypoints which meeting dvd-video point
you can start places where you are

312
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,070
you can start track where you walked

313
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,370
are where you draw of you can go to
college

314
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,240
to you can you can build two-way
pointing to a row it's

315
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,730
sense when you have a number of it out
you can because have

316
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,760
how is a memory getting cheaper and
cheaper and

317
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,429
for what was squad today expensive

318
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,660
hope impossible to get few years ago now
and now you get

319
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,150
you you get day you get maps

320
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,200
you get base map see a detailed maps

321
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,669
and him you can

322
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:56,390
view you can name chains ohs maps

323
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,140
you can bite him my I was talking about

324
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,809
maps late have doctored our navigation
is became popular in the last couple

325
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:05,649
years

326
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,910
separate all good on its way which few
short days

327
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,000
pass out to go to his sons ham

328
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,520
I worked once on something called mentee
at a Korean

329
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,910
CJ if you want to go from A to B

330
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,720
you can't really do an exhaustive search

331
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,860
to of on possible doubts it would

332
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,910
be I'm even for a simple connection with
its

333
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,940
history city would and into billions
have possibilities

334
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,049
so you use various algorithms

335
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:44,090
which him mostly just look at situation

336
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,520
past and selected chart this one

337
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,830
of course there has his you will see in
their

338
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,149
near that road video I have a GN does
know is

339
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,500
lead you to we would like to go sorry

340
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,890
never see if you have your favorite way
of going

341
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:08,860
stick to it can't back to if you have no
idea how to get from A to B 10

342
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,620
in you soon use go to know

343
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,520
don't navigation cause him show

344
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,790
regular programs running on your GPS so

345
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,790
you see it on and then expand her under
Windows

346
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,730
mobile platform you can

347
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,660
down proprietary program sir

348
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,380
you he isn't it may be a.m. group of
users switch

349
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,780
an which can act sick all weekend

350
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:48,660
who so is some kind of trap door now
here he adds various types here

351
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,340
hand-held wats hand mostly

352
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:01,340
for hiking use special specialize you
image thank my wife uses one

353
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:06,100
this is for geo caching our talk about
it little later

354
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,220
it actually download scrimmage you could
be geo caching sites

355
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,309
to very soon a.m. posing values

356
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:16,490
places where you cash is sound start

357
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,020
so it's so you can to geocache US

358
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,309
any GPS bed is so gives you a little

359
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:29,030
hedge standard %um now

360
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,980
here you have a car unit which

361
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,450
I'm to the show's to pick to know to

362
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,530
Harry I were to make it turn enters

363
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:49,080
intersection senator this dish and
military units

364
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,059
them services donkey I don't know where

365
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,590
this was a.m. is he weird two years ago

366
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,919
I'm talking about tens of thousands of
dollars for

367
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,980
he choose from the one billion in many
conflicts

368
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:09,559
to two soldiers and ask you you and your
family to send him

369
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,330
has civilian units return should be more
user-friendly

370
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,290
how he adds various

371
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,270
him on each a.m. GPS you have been
numbered of

372
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,850
screams hand and you use

373
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,650
you can cycles through the various
schemes

374
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:36,000
said this is Aaron screen which shows
you the satellite

375
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,179
coverage and UN's it made land use ito's

376
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:45,179
circles and you see how many satellites
out a visible to the GPS

377
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,620
it's in various circles and

378
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,950
saying to sing but isn't this cert
circle which can still be received by

379
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,399
your GPS

380
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,190
the distance to the service clues over
5,000

381
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,190
I'm better have over 5,000 miles

382
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,899
this is a compass who knows him as a

383
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:16,030
now as it display on your GPS which him

384
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,700
will show you soon he if you move

385
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,820
it will show you where note since houses

386
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,629
am somewhat say units now have bouncer
electronic compass about

387
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,880
to pay nines in egg because he he said
to have to

388
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,880
very reset it once in a while very
welcome in this circle

389
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,090
TG Sharon his son as a screen which

390
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,990
use quite often chose who goes left to
eat shows you that this stones

391
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,750
to your destination for your speech hem

392
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,850
now used on the plane shows retail as t2

393
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,250
into time to you get

394
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,669
this is an as a popular hams display
which is set to relax three-dimensional

395
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,530
saint is Casey's Egypt

396
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:15,530
should go slightly dizzy left to get to
destination

397
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:27,390
soon as it's clean this is a

398
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:33,210
jazzy when was so the way and says

399
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,920
swear you wear little got synthesis
harder

400
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,080
more elaborate unit and one problem is
that

401
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,770
since a call or scream and allowed to
unit two required

402
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,860
so lots of powers for the smaller units
with an aunt

403
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,910
on to Savio's to AA says where and for

404
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,350
hamp sorry phone towers were here you
would have to change your batteries

405
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:04,480
quite often as soon as it popular in

406
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,610
screen you will see top commenter
commenter odometer

407
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:15,100
so see where you were how fast you are
going into to comment they're scared

408
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,970
changes

409
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,580
issue speed increases so let's see if
you own a plane it will go

410
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,230
600 miles if you walk goes from 0 to
maybe

411
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,350
20 mines this is

412
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,370
time screen which shows a local time

413
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,870
possibly today UTC time

414
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,330
hose surgeon time to: to you knife to

415
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,600
to do this nations and

416
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,800
time to 2 a.m. time how long queue to up

417
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,110
now

418
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,350
to GPS

419
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,450
every GPS his is easy USB or serial

420
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:08,450
for

421
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:19,779
certain

422
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:24,590
this is how a GPS unit converses with
CPC

423
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,830
now you can you can use these

424
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,389
part to update your use software

425
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:37,070
if you hiked the computer you can a few
high Q GPS you will know how to

426
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,870
how tune getting to it see in there it's

427
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,070
now this usually a trap daughter

428
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,418
yes shades im

429
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:54,309
basic communication unit communication

Electronics Association home 20 183

432
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,409
and you can find him I have it to him

433
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,570
to brought donuts usually act 15 20
pages

434
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,779
where do you have an discredited the FIM

435
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:20,720
if you descriptive characters you sent
the information to the GPS

436
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,139
and to you check some and Janet to
response how

437
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:32,139
give South Gate give some examples

438
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,640
showed ziff farm at Dove Sen holtz's

439
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,980
phrase is being sent to jail GPS unit

440
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,100
and received from the GPS unit his
city's

441
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,500
nm yea and it starts with a dollar sign

442
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,670
when you have a descriptive words and
you have to date can you imagine you've

443
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,080
been

444
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,540
hostilities scans and you have it
checked Sam an

445
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,920
if you can make you GPS to an

446
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,240
save its ear

447
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,370
some kind of 10 min them emulation hands
through

448
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,660
28mm nation program ten you can easily
send

449
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,830
information to GGP is miss you

450
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,280
Han

451
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,800
however to be accepted by DGPS you have
to

452
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,360
give each XM he wrote a letter to

453
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,930
programming basic you can easily
translated

454
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,950
to to any hazard language

455
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,510
so it's ok to have reached the reach you
for days

456
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,510
between two dollar sign in to ask that
is

457
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:59,250
and tack to work is done

458
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,870
he's done and to next screen

459
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,180
line 970 you

460
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,980
you XO order each successive

461
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,460
for him he successive ask you in it

462
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,090
and chain once you exiled from left to
right

463
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,720
you end up with well I'm one by

464
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,550
ham so high no and

465
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,639
you have to send sis by after disasters

466
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,130
to any content information will be
accepted by

467

00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:07,170
of your version of your software and

475
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,710
to him to identify you who you need

476
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,040
and what comes back used to be you know
its

477
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,860
them it gives you 2 p-8 P which is
product by defeating

478
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,160
identification this software
identification

479
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,659
two incomes characters stewing

480
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,000
which is steer name a few units hopes to
see you

481
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,480
match and then it was a hands magellan
sparks track

482
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,610
hands and sentences serial number of
your unit

483
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,820
Han this is important because

484
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,820
many software companies

485
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,190
now in use a cell use of 20 guy to your
specific

486
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,420
unit sorry if yourself to receive said
wrong

487
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:07,420
here serial number it one it won't work

488
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,010
now usually do you get the GPS unit it
is a biz p.m.

489
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:22,580
basemap when them when you go to a
different

490
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,400
today a reality go to Europe his base
map will not work

491
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,380
you want to get in as a basement to him

492
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,900
GPS manufacturers chance you probably
modes into

493
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,080
GPS units should have areas hacks

494
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,380
to install base maps on on GPS units

495
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,550
and Jack defendant Louie

496
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,220
you need specific now to us what works
with

497
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,690
I G and then they will not work which
Garmin with no

498
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,690
works was Lawrence to where you find out
about it

499
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,760
town newsgroups and

500
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,580
people people just hacked your GPS is
and find out

501
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,980
exactly worked work to do an

502
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,390
I have imagined sparks react so you
tests

503
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:18,390
and you hold the power key engine
navigation go to navigation keys in the

504
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,940
power key Jenna

505
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,830
has a window into with Dalton with 00
and now you can

506
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,020
chain sieve al you scenes is changes led
to the window

507
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,480
to what you want so I had no chance to
actions actually how to

508
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,170
he stole a base map on UT on your

509
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,860
I gym and GPS had

510
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,780
whenever it to them manufacture attack
magic and finds

511
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:52,060
had some words pace maps posted a cheery
mood to try to remove him

512
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,240
I

513
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,240
one word of caution you have to know
what you are doing because you

514
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,270
put the wrong number into it said

515
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,790
that to the window you may completely
disable your unit

516
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,710
had many times you can recover from

517
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:17,760
now

518
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,500
GPS is out great for high Q you

519
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,450
you space you wouldn't know where you
are

520
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,530
want to call you follow a trail you

521
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,540
him it will tell you when to turn left
or right

522
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,759
hey you have to keep track of something
called heading in something called

523
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,090
daring heading is say direction in which
you are going

524
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,380
I mean Norris will be heading out 0

525
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,520
sows who'd be heading up 180 and bearing

526
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,250
is dead angle to you re to your
destination so if you

527
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,580
fewer hey if you can traveling

528
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,860
directly to your destination debating
would be zero

529
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,980
he few have to go to try to bring

530
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,020
maybe twenty degrees its own

531
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,280
if you know what's heading what's
bearing

532
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,570
you you will get to know some of its a
unit chose a turn

tell you too was it to turn left or
right pay a specific

534
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:27,650

535
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,150
how here i connect and who made a high

536
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,790
Keymer hubert words it's in Monmouth
County

537
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,790
New Jersey and

538
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,830
him to big GPS keeps

539
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,060
three cards to track how you

540
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:54,650
how you walked so you can 10 transfers
to many software programs is

541
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,110
you know you stop for USA from alarm

542
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,640
and you can transfer cue track

543
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,850
to do to your no I'm

544
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:10,029

how you walk how you high stood this is
a great

546
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,290
things you connect your GPS few computer
where you starlets

547
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,480
Topo USA are many other programs

548
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,010
and few you can study

549
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:32,010
your apt now it's a builtin compacts

550
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,370
say take on passage reading from your

551
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:40,810
on your GPS see required sick you move

552
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,009
because you know City

553
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,520
satellite doesn't know which weighs

554
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,680
nor suicide case you position who speed
back

555
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,720
to get an idea was is if you stand still

556

562
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,270
and and TM

563
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,290

00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,810
which I don't last and does an
electronic compass

came be if you do something wrong kid
with a really mislead you

571
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,940
magnetic compass will not one of the
features of this compass it's quite

572
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,190
heavy it's made

573
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,450
to a with big ass so it

574
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:20,680
kids who owns it local eddy currents

575
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,299
I can use it on the plane and to him

576
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,100
he it is not affected by aids

577
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:35,100
beatty action from comes in various
fields

578
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:42,779
now few words about geocache use a
worldwide sparked

579
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,750
and save this I game it's free

580
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,110
once a special privileges a payment 1525
.se

00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:13,680
you you getting location and the you go
to that place you

585
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,799
look around you will usually find a
little box with some

586
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,880
some knick-knacks inside so

same see with his cell phones

638
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:01,410
now GDP some GPS on the web at: said
various sites

639
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,440
them jazz shows us some to date magnet

640
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,610
yeah if you have access to Usenet

641
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,120
issues become more and more difficult to
get to

642
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,319
to say good geocache Inc am

643
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,370
am site on Usenet

644
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,190
to manufacture to keep to posts and then
some

645
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,980
churn out your cache Inc hey I'm Geno

646
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,940
ham GPS sides

647
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,510
you can find reviews so various units

648
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:38,830
says owners yeah

649
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,840
towns are some ham

650
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:48,840
some 28 magazine you most subscribed to

651
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,370
he said the various ways say Angie
operate am into

652
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:56,609
power supplies

653
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:02,710
rechargeable cells Han the manufacture
of course tried to convince you to

654

battery switch can be replace

659
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,509
where do we go from here to save him
most of the current satellites reach

660
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,470
their design limit

661
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,930
so it is them ham take new ones will

662
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,250
have we have higher powers block

663
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:47,190
three satellites now it's the end I
would like to show you deserve this

664
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,210
and my slideshow and with I would have a
little

665
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:54,580
hair this on

00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,910
happy this is the neem

670
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:28,910
dade document simpson's

671
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,140
thanks to a new GPS don't have you would

672
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,848
green okay where I can

673
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:09,890
50 major and aviator and media speeches
many yeah I

674
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,790
which is 30 feet encased out picky
divided by kicking nine times can you

675
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:14,410
take

676
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,920
well you at Miss Georgia Tech
recalculating turn right

677
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,619
and 4.5 meters back now can go
construction I

678
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:27,910
stupid kid think he's smarter than a
computer do you feel

679
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:33,399
kids do

680
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:39,090
do you

681
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:44,940
do

682
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,960
secret elevation tantrik

683
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,700
entered iraq you have reached your
destination

684
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,900
okay my try

685
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,900
in 2.3 economic your

686
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,700
recaptured a go cold goes home

687
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:09,700
this a little

688
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,120
audio synchronization problem so

689
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,290
the reason he throws it into the water
is that she's given in the distance

690
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,500
commenters which blows his mind so he
throws it in the water

691
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,260
if you have any questions

692
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:35,260
go ahead

693
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,560
yeah how is a

694
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,190
Galloway 0.2 g/t thing is that going to
be different from GPS the European

695
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,240
Callao system

696
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,890
were wellhead this and this stand is
still in the planning stages so on and

697
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,470
do that

698
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:55,000
am I think the so anti shot a couple of

699
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,210
him to us for testing agency shocked why
I'm

700
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:04,280
when unit out by I'm not sure it's a I
doubt it would be compatible

701
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,280
to provoke you would need a difference
said different

702
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,350
set of receivers teams who is good on us
it's not compatible

703
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:19,080
good on matthews's said elliptical
orbits resident circular orbits said

704
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,529
said

705
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:22,570
to Sat russian satellite Sarah

706
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,820
more spend more time over to

707
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,130
Russian federations him

708
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,440
him went to the rest of the world

709
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:40,360
hello

710
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,620
I'd like to know what company makes
their German compass with the brass

711
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,359
housing

712
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,040
and word order had how Kate's K

713
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,640
if you send me e-mail I will try to find
it and he took me quite a lot of

714
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,200
searching have it's a fantastic compact
cute skinny

715
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,260
and node see to cater in fact I audited
by fallen and

716
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,470
and they said they don't accept any
credit cards

717
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:12,260
type with 150 hundred dollars in
Antelope

718
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,850
and send it to Germany in network vision

719
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:20,580
I it's probably more than you need for

720
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,230
I it's great for hiking and shit
fantastic

721
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:28,820
compress year

722
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,040
in yearly be because it has a

723
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,070
his a.m. babul so you know you get

724
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:39,160
he'd it is the way you can put it on a
tripod

725
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,009
church it's a really nice unit the

726
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:48,020
the GPS is used for military and
civilian and so it's obviously subject

727
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,470
to

728
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,730
being it's being its subject to being a

729
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:56,470
destroyed or tampered with or injured
and also it's also subject to

730
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,890
radiation such solar flares and that's
our thing so if that happens are we to

731
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,799
rely on GPS if it's being used

732
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,100
everywhere and we're all pinned on GPS
Shin

733
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,130
don't you think that sort of a a
dangerous situation

734
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:15,490
where it says in gode so that dust is
civilian

735
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:19,060
using gives the soon it says gives him a
favor

736
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,490
Sir JJ done promise anything to do with

737
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,110
keep it going whatever so that's

738
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:30,730
that's the reason why see European Union
is trying to develop soon

739
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:36,300
Terron you need 2d did GPS is basically
a military

740
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,080
catch it issues on missiles

741
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,710
you stone for an artillery purposes

742
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:48,560
and sidelines they give it to today
civilian population and

743
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:55,150
use it's the way you want it and

744
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:58,680
to give you no promises since it will
keep it going

745
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,690
I have a question is there any

746
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:05,160
regeneration from officers stores in
like if you have a storm

747
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,399
lives in her care when I is there going
to be more

748
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:15,600
error being generated devices today

749
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,650
I i guess im when

750
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,020
he missed army you you will get slight
distortion

751
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,810
to I didn't notice anything and it's
more incidences

752
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,880
in jeans that would send said

753
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,360
to leaf canopy will affect your
reception

754
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,060
much more in some in this storm was you

755
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:42,130
I'm and I don't really need subsidized I
was

756
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,450
time thinking that the single coming in
from the GPS satellite

757
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,420
from space down there are those curious
if any kind of like

758
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,160
storm a crazy atmosphere phenomenon
mites

759
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,049
I guess you see bands than that or
affected her some

760
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:03,490
or somewhere with otherwise massive your
yes it made by quic receive like at

761
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,500
least forty five satellites

762
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,330
I guess we have to your his

763
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:14,720
expect where finished quick one houses

764
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,050
okay hey if you want to have any
question would be outside

765
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,370
%ah
