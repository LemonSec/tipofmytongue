1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,439
we are the we have an outage the
elevator is down which

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,120
thank you guys for coming out

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,710
to the next hope I'm

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,210
quickly about myself I my name is laszlo

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,230
I had a syndicated radio feature for 12
years call the techno file that was

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,520
syndicated around the world

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,470
I was %ah a writer and journalist I
wrote for

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,160
magazines such as playful way in High
Times am

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,830
which contains my favorite things I'm

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,059
and I taught at the University Missouri
School of Journalism

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,099
I have also worked on a lot of video
games including now Red Dead Redemption

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,329
our Grand Theft Auto bully and the like
I'm

13
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,600
what I want to talk about is this battle
that we've got right now between content

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,129
creators and consumers

15
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,390
arm and how its threat need journalism

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,969
art magazines I 2600 I as well as
interactive companies

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,129
arm in this online landscape that

18
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:03,710
is now expecting everything for free I'm

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,520
so let's talk about the history I love
the internet most people were on the

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,470
internets

21
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,850
I am starting fifteen years ago when
they thought AOL was the Internet I'm

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,210
and up but let's %uh

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,520
let's go back to the roaring nineties

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,970
I'm wow the launch parties were amazing
and for those of you that we're here in

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,900
New York Silicon Alley was like our
studio 54

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,860
there was a launch party every other
night olive your friends that could

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,090
close an HTML tag were making six
figures

28
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,500
and worth a million dollars on paper I
am

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,890
it was a phenomenal time in that all the
sudden we had all this content online

30
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,979
up for free movies

31
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,509
music video games um newspapers

32
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:56,960
we're all rushing to go online in all
these web sites

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,950
wanted your eyeballs that was the
currency that they were trading in

34
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,490
I am and up course a lot of them went
outta business

35
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,429
om but we've got this is sort of
expectation not

36
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,560
I love up the value of content that's
affecting a lot of different industries

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
so

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,550
I'm gonna touch real quickly on sharing

39
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,030
I'm Shereen

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,379
is its inherent in human nature

41
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,629
I we would not be here today if people
did not share

42
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,220
since we're talking about history let's
go back

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,150
to the roaring 50,000 BC if these fools
hadn't shared

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,050
we would not be here today they share
technology information about tools

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,950
where the Antelope are I how to kill
them

46
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,370
I am if if they were patent rolls back
then

47
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,370
we would be extinct I'm so

48
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,230
for tens of thousands of years we shared
it insured our survival

49
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,140
as a species arm if you were a bit of a
shitty farmer one-year

50
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,709
hopefully somebody else the tribe to
give you some food to survive the winter

51
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,220
also things have changed since some

52
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:25,190
then we ate now instead of working
outside we work in cubicles move in ones

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,190
and zeros around we still have the sort
of

54
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:33,870
inclination to share um these days
though most people don't grow food

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,909
in less it's in Farmville I'm

56
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,959
but we're all connected to this

57
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,370
network we've got these expectations

58
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,799
some at and is perceived value love of
content and in the last fifteen years to

59
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,830
be. idiotic things have happened

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,170
we have

61
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,040
we've been involved in this weird battle

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,189
with industry arm associations

63
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,750
that has made no sense it is insane that
I'm considered a felon for ripping a DVD

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,900
I own to my iPhone

65
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,310
it's ludicrous I'm

66
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,350
many be remember the DCSS cases that die
manual was involved in

67
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,150
I am and

68
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,400
I was there protesting outside a
miramax's office

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,530
because it was at absolutely ludicrous

70
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,340
that printing this code was somehow
going to end you up in prison

71
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,350
so we wonder is consumers

72
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,490
how are these trade group so stupid

73
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,100
you why are they so out of touch

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,199
and I can explain it in one word

75
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,460
the penis the penis makes this dumb

76
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,320
and when a lot of men get together

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,180
here's the secretive industry trade
group they are composed of people that

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,680
hate each other

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,789
hate each other if you're in an industry
trade group like the Motion Picture

80
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:10,580
Association

81
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,659
you're sitting on a board with other
companies that you want to put

82
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,310
out of business you're in a fierce
competitive environment

83
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,020
so you get all these company
representatives together and nobody

84
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,758
wants to look like a pussy

85
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,800
cell somebody says well

86
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,380
have we've got a report hear about
grandma who's been uploading some music

87
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,650
to the Internet

88
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,030
and instead of somebody around the table
same while you now

89
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,410
that sounds a little far fetched a go
well we are to teach her a lesson

90
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,120
and the guy next to him says oh yeah
llama seem even more balls than Sony

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,660
we should go to her house in a raster
and then the other

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,100
guy from another company who wants to
pop his chest out anymore says

93
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,789
we gotta go over to our house a drag
route the street at center ass on fire

94
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:05,039
and so you have his mob mentality

95
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,370
on these as on these associations where
people

96
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,720
completely lose their sanity arm its

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,800
it's sort of like when you get a bunch
of frat boys together the mentality that

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,970
results there so it's difficult to have
to real discussions about sharing

99
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,069
are and how much content is worth when
you've got these clowns that are

100
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,900
basically polluting landscape

101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,780
om so

102
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,389
this relationship that we have cut with
content on the Internet has created our

103
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,550
another issue in a lot of ways we don't
value content anymore it's ephemeral

104
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,990
it's all over the place

105
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,060
arm you know most people on the mp3
player

106
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,720
have 10,000 songs I am

107
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,030
that the value has diminished but who
cares about music who cares about

108
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,180
a musical cares about video games the
real issue

109
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,430
is that journalism is being guarded with
this mentality

110
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,610
um the fourth estate

111
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,900
who is supposed to be keeping tabs
online our government

112
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,310
and shenanigans from a low-level
newspaper in Paducah

113
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,460
all the way up to washington DC is being
guarded

114
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,289
are newspapers are shutting down are
they are downsizing their client closing

115
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,979
for and asks a lot of people say well
we've got blogs

116
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:25,979
am blogs in a lotta wages piggyback on
newspaper content

117
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,520
it some clown linking to a real
journalist a

118
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,560
article and saying I've got some
opinions on this

119
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,220
om the weird thing about newspapers
right now

120
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,590
it and journalism for that matter it has
more reach

121
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,870
then ever arm

122
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,449
james sasser wacky from the new yorker
had a great article about the city says

123
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,289
the problem with newspapers

124
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,750
isn't the internet its us we want access
to everything

125
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,210
we want it for free we want it now it's
a consumer's dream but it's an

126
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,030
unsustainable relationship without paid

127
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,550
journalists democracy will continue to
head down the path

128
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,169
of corporations pillaging our country
arm

129
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,490
in this terrible good journalists in a
lotta ways now

130
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,449
we've got blogs and cable TV news

131
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,410
because we are drunk on commentary god
damn if you can turn a cable

132
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,650
new station on and its people talking
about what they think about a story

133
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,250
rather than giving you fax

134
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,740
who what when where why and how we've
gone out the window

135
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,519
arm journalism costs money

136
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,219
om so we as a community have to support
magazine in newspapers

137
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,470
and not throw a tantrum when they ask to
be compensated for their work

138
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,920
I R I love Boing Boing to death I'm on
there all day long

139
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,120
but damn if they don't throw a hissy fit
when a newspaper puts their content

140
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,300
behind a paywall

141
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,080
arm I hate paywalls I think therefore
shit

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,230
but fifteen years ago there was a
paywall

143
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,080
it was called putting fifty cents in a
box and pain that company in those

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,740
journalists for their work

145
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,279
arm what we need is some kind of
micropayment system

146
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,970
where a dollar goes into a fund

147
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,380
and that money is distributed per day

148
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,040
across all the news web sites that you
visit so if you're a visit to each one

149
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,319
gets fifty cents

150
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,990
if you visit a thousand they divvy that
up arm incrementally

151
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,019
and it will mean the journalist can
actually get paid for the content

152
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:32,750
because

153
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,290
a lot of people say well advertising
will paid-for journalism

154
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,769
I am journal is dependent on advertising
are beholden to corporate sponsors when

155
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,089
I had a nationally syndicated radio show

156
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,100
are and started talking shit about
gateway you know I had radio stations

157
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,640
calling me saying we're not running your
feature because gateway

158
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,350
runs commercials on our station I so

159
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,130
I am and the other thing that you have

160
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,040
so great you've got this this model
where

161
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,800
newspapers and magazines are supported
by advertising what's happened in the

162
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
last two years

163
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,399
advertising's gone down the crapper I
don't know if you've noticed that

164
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,839
magazines that used to be that the car
now like a fraction of it

165
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,040
and so what happens is major magazines
are shutting down

166
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,260
and Dom newspapers as well

167
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,130
I am

168
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,700
there's a big stink going on about
Murdoch in the pay walls over in the UK

169
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,950
right now and I David Mitchell the
observer had a great quote he said like

170
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,519
the bile that this powdered and

171
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,670
a newspaper website comments actions
this demonstrates a lamentable truth

172
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,260
many people only really value something
they paid for

173
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,980
it is stacking to me when you read a
fantastic article online

174
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,610
by a smart journalist and then right
under it knotted inches somebody going

175
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,760
to Obamacare sucks

176
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,990
I however we'll how did this kind of
discourse to happen

177
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,540
am so

178
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,670
what we've got is an unsustainable
relationship we can scream and shout

179
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,060
that everything needs to be free but
we've got to figure out

180
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,209
how to pay journalists to cover

181
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,250
the government each other

182
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:21,810
I the most-watched new station in
america is headed by this man

183
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,769
is %uh what my favorite quotes from him
is up my first qualification is I didn't

184
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,019
go to Columbia Journalism School

185
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,019
I Fox News is proud to not hire
journalists

186
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:37,630
arm journalists are things like ethics
which really get in the way of stuff

187
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,410
I'm I know it's easy to bash Fox News I
think MSNBC's equally for the garbage

188
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,620
I but it's just easier to digest for
some reason

189
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,570
I'm you know Fox is running articles

190
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,010
I TV stories right now in Chicago

191
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,740
about why the library system should be
shut down

192
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,269
and that money could be funneled to the
police

193
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:07,829
I am it sa yeah

194
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,829
where in the middle other propaganda war

195
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:14,630
and were refusing to fund the good guys

196
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,120
I'm so who are the good guys

197
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,720
2600 I am you know with major magazines

198
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,040
going down the toilet our it is affected

199
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,420
all publishing including 2600 you know I

200
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,810
magazine distributors are are increasing
their cut

201
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,680
it's becoming quite unprofitable in the
last couple years to publish

202
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,070
arm which means that all love this

203
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,480
and this community and the things that
we do when we get together and all the

204
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,630
cool stuff

205
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,600
that we've find out at these conferences
is in jeopardy

206
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,920
I because it's bankrolled by the
magazine

207
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,790
om so I ask olive you to put your money
where your mouth is

208
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,560
and get a subscription don't don't rely
on the newsstand sales like none of that

209
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,269
money goes to 2600

210
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:08,350
I am sign up for us a multi-year
subscription and just get it over with

211
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,630
and support this community because you
don't it's gonna go away

212
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,769
and Amanda needs money to keep people at
a jail I'm

213
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,430
he has busted more fools at a prison
every time I'm talking to him he's

214
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,310
posting bail for somebody

215
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,440
and a protest at the RNC arm

216
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,750
that's where this money goes is to
protect this community

217
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,550
am

218
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,899
so but this relationship we have with
content is not just affecting

219
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,360
are journalism in newspapers in and
democracy

220
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,480
it's affecting the other industries arm

221
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,949
how many have you are were big PC gamers

222
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,339
so enhance arm kinda hard to find PC
games these days

223
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,480
I am lotta times their ported from our

224
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,300
a console or they come out

225
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,670
many months later what are the reasons
is because there's an unsustainable

226
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,420
relationship between the PC gaming
community

227
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,959
are and video game creators Tom

228
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,139
and that is within seconds have a game
coming out

229
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:15,360
Bob its online for free and people say
it well

230
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,510
you now I'm not gonna pay for it more
mobile games what I love

231
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,680
like crazy arm you

232
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,529
spent several years making a a mobile
game arm

233
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,649
and for every one copy that's purchase
three copies

234
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:34,310
are are downloaded so seventy-five
percent of people enjoying your work are

235
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,260
not paying for it this is an
unsustainable relationship

236
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,620
I am and of course other industries are
affected by

237
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,579
by this as well I am and I say this

238
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,860
because this all leads up to I

239
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,350
a discussion on network neutrality we've
got this

240
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,029
fifteen to twenty year party that we've
been involved in here

241
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,130
arm where everything's been free for all

242
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,750
and we've had in an open Internet arm

243
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,829
for those of you that don't know what
network neutrality is Tom

244
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:09,760
it's a press will propose for user
access networks participate in the

245
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,339
Internet advocates no restrictions by
Internet service providers

246
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,120
and government on content sites
platforms on the kinds of equipment may

247
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,949
be attached

248
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:23,959
and no restrictions on the modes of
communication allowed I'm

249
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,310
at some point these trade group

250
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,730
and entertainment companies a my
prediction is

251
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,970
are going to convince politicians to
pass laws to

252
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,079
allow internet filtering our and at that
point wherein

253
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,440
in big trouble I their their arguments
going to be that net these networks are

254
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,579
being used

255
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,860
to I traffic stolen goods

256
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,310
and that they need them shut down not

257
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,589
I i would like this to not be the future
but every time

258
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:59,160
we as a country sort of get into an
issue

259
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,019
arm insane laws are passed

260
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:07,019
I if you look at life twenty-five years
ago as opposed to now

261
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,160
every day more and more rules get passed
in this country

262
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,160
more and more laws you pass in this
country I am

263
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,930
I don't think any vessel ever be able to
take a tuba toothpaste on a plane again

264
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,509
arm were we're heading to a world of
more restrictions and not less

265
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,630
I NP boys that you know the people rise
up they're not going to stand for this

266
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,430
kinda stuff for

267
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,759
look at robotic cameras every town in
america is installing these things to

268
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,959
issue tickets

269
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,839
and arm what we should be doing is
taking them out from a distance with a

270
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,019
pellet gun

271
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:48,019
om

272
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,709
but people tend to give up a lot

273
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,870
for arm convenience

274
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,040
I am every one of us in this room
probably carries

275
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,530
us on some form a mobile phone the
trade-off that you've got with that is

276
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,260
that that the police can triangulate
your position

277
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,760
are made any time there's all sorts a
really exciting server logs that are

278
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,890
capped

279
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,220
that show where you were when that Tom

280
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,799
can get subpoenaed in case you have done
something wrong

281
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,510
arm so my prediction is that this wild
west

282
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,710
up the Internet could very well get
clamps down on unregulated

283
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,330
the more these entertainment companies
get involved by an ISP's

284
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,100
arm the cable companies are already
looking at me

285
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,660
to monitor what you're doing online

286
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,850
are and try to keep you from doing so
suppose that bad things

287
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,219
I am the up

288
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,760
is this going to be the death of network
network neutrality arm

289
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,260
these telecom and entertainment
companies want to privatize the net so

290
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,500
badly

291
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,980
arm they want to have unregulated
pricing power

292
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,240
and if you look at our the the FCC you
know well they allow this

293
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,360
at the FCC has rubber-stamped more
nonsense in the last 20 years it is

294
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,500
disgusting

295
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,080
up want the ones that my favorite ways
they'd

296
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,270
headed out licenses due to radio
companies and said you guys are gonna be

297
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,059
two satellite radio companies

298
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,428
and in order for you to get this
spectrum you can't merge

299
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,539
ever and they're like awesome and so
they

300
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:32,629
run out an XM and Sirius launched

301
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,039
and then they came back a few years
later to the FCC and said all we're

302
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:36,830
sorry well

303
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,340
we spent all our money a given it to
major league baseball and football

304
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,610
so that we can run their shit games am

305
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,480
if you've got a lettuce merge and so the
FCC set of

306
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,610
we're sorry that you failed in business
of course will let you create a monopoly

307
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,270
and so I

308
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,440
and so they it so they merged and I had
a show

309
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,580
a national show on I'll be in Anthony's
channel

310
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,260
and not serious came in and said the
highs and this and this would happen to

311
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,940
be entertainment assholes

312
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,270
his guesthouse love the show a little
bit of a problem or cut your pay by 75

313
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,360
percent

314
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,580
wow thanks a lot C later we'll be
providing content for your platform

315
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,379
anymore

316
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,780
I am the %ah

317
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,440
the FCC is rubber-stamped a lot of
horrible stuff and

318
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,860
and I could see them allowing

319
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,390
broadband providers to not let you
connect to certain sites

320
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,789
its its absolutely feasible arm

321
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:44,960
how do we keep this future from
happening we've got to support

322
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,740
newspapers and magazines subscribe to
make

323
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,610
subscribe to 2600 arm you know support
public radio

324
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,700
am WikiLeaks I I don't know if you read
the article in The

325
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,900
the new yorker about arm the WikiLeaks
but it was

326
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,720
outstanding the journalists that ran
around with them I'll while they were

327
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,250
putting this video together

328
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,830
I was absolutely amazing and
organizations like that

329
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,510
who went through a lot of steps that a
journalist is supposed to go through

330
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,710
vetting material getting things right

331
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,190
om those kinda morgan et organizations
need to be supported

332
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,140
and and finally you know support people
that make content

333
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,190
you enjoy or it may not be around for
much longer

334
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,299
you know we take a lot of this stuff for
granted by

335
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,549
in the in that discussion over content
it's always the you know the big

336
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,480
companies the big movie companies but
it's affecting

337
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,140
the small guy %ah it's affecting 2608
could affect this community said ok

338
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,490
keep supporting this community and I'll
take a

339
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,250
questions from anybody

340
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,150
about video games well

341
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,990
yes um so earlier you talked about a
social make a payment system

342
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,650
that would sorta make it convenient for
consumers to

343
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,400
support Armada content providers that
are online

344
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,740
there's one that is also exactly what
you describe called flatter

345
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,169
FL attr and basically

346
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:19,320
you could imagine your site and anyone
as

347
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,720
a platter account came just like you
with arms up

348
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,440
and then they pay flatter a monthly fee
that they set themselves and gets

349
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,210
distributed to all the sides equally

350
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,309
and its pretty straightforward nom

351
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:35,030
adamant that their privacy policy or
anything like that so I don't know how

352
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,408
evil they are but but it sounds awesome
but there needs to be some kinda

353
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,470
top-down

354
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,100
up thing that happens where all the
newspapers

355
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,590
get together and say okay we're all
going in on this we're all gonna put our

356
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,500
content behind

357
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,190
this pay wall I have this micropayment
system

358
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,900
the problem with that is that somebody
would probably file an antitrust suit

359
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,820
arm so I don't want the creators of the
wire

360
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,610
went in from the congress and recently
in Baghdad said

361
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,730
you guys have got to figure out a way to
find newspapers

362
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,610
I because they are in big trouble and

363
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,679
this this idea that the news is it
always should be free

364
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,490
killing them next

365
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,980
we now have a culture from the last 20
years

366
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,630
work all opinions are essentially

367
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,159
I'll treated as if they are equal I
teach math

368
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,030
I had a kid tell me that the answer to
our problems

369
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,330
was X I responded I don't think so

370
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,780
I love X by the way and I'll

371
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:50,020
I do to actually why is almost as good

372
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,129
my response was I don't think so and he
argued with me

373
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,250
about the answer to a problem

374
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,070
as in insisting I had to be wrong

375
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,780
and even my answer book had to be wrong

376
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,770
because his opinion was equally valid

377
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,908
I don't know is there's a question here
but you wanna comment I am

378
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:19,200
I don't know if if any of you are
familiar with the term Millennials

379
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,330
am s some interesting reading online
about Millennials

380
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,090
arm there's a generation that

381
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,120
that has come up arm that is this
constantly connected generation that

382
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,669
expects

383
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,760
you know and as always had everything
for free so why should you pay for

384
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,690
anything

385
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,650
arm but they're having their getting out
of college

386
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,880
which is funded by mommy and daddy and
they've been coddled their entire life

387
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,220
you know they had a a mobile phone since
the since they were too

388
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,090
arm hand there's these there's all these
articles about how

389
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,408
horribly they're doing in the workplace
I

390
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,450
because they've they are

391
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,240
they will literally they've been so
caught although have their momma call

392
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,590
their manager

393
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,668
I am and pop and I've managed people

394
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:13,090
arm and manage production teams and
you've really got a weed out the

395
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,209
Millennials because

396
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,740
I am they they're like you know real I
can't work hard because I've got yoga

397
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,220
and Dom as like obviously you don't
understand the entertainment industry

398
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,309
we're here to grind ourselves stupid to
make this product

399
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:28,960
I'm max thank you I'm

400
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,309
very much enjoyed you talk on here's my
question

401
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:37,899
we we come together and I I at camera
for the gentleman's name

402
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,650
yesterday but we come together in a room

403
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:46,330
like this and that civ the comment that
he made with virtual

404
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,309
communities are great but you know
there's nothing like getting together

405
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,700
face to face

406
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,630
and you know really hashing stuff out

407
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,010
net neutrality it's a big ran concept
means different things to different

408
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,900
people but

409
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,549
I totally get what you're asking for
here at the same time

410
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:10,158
I feel like we need more like II wanna
find a way and I'm not sure what that

411
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,919
is to organize and bring this

412
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,750
issue to the forefront but the American
mindset

413
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,900
that they're losing something

414
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,600
and it doesn't United not everybody's
gonna get it but I'm just wondering what

415
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,380
ways

416
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,340
and I don't know again whether it's a
question here either but I just wanna

417
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,668
put the set to the room

418
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:33,230
what ways can we organize that are just
supporting what the content we love

419
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,659
which I'd

420
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:37,429
totally agree with to to really like

421
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,860
you need to really drive this point home
because as you say it's almost

422
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,750
I mean you know sadly sit here
pessimistically it's a it's a fait

423
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,340
accompli you know that

424
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,289
they're gonna do it and I'm like know
what

425
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,210
so yeah I i mean

426
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,210
I

427
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,950
I always try to send money to as many

428
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,370
organizations like the EFSF and and
folks like that that

429
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:09,010
that I can hoping that somebody else has
the time to pick these issues

430
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,039
I its it's very difficult as a

431
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,570
isn't as an activist not to be a
paycheck activists were you just like

432
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,220
alright here's twenty bucks don't kill
me more whales

433
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,090
and but

434
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,529
you know as I was a again journalists
for many years

435
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:29,289
and especially are covering stuff like
the

436
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:33,340
Digital Millennium Copyright Act in and
on all that

437
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,320
there's some I think there's a point
where sometimes weekend we is

438
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,928
L to have liberal electronic activist
people

439
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:44,909
can go a bit are too far arm

440
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:49,740
I I will say perfect example like 2600

441
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,799
I am sales at this magaziner down
considerably

442
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:58,129
I while people are scanning the denim
putting it up on bit torrent

443
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,150
arm you know

444
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,529
sharing information is awesome but if
the source that information goes out a

445
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,450
business we're all screwed

446
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,730
I'll and we lose a lot

447
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,820
and I you know I don't I don't know if
you know we should get some parties

448
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,220
together go get these guys I mean what
can you

449
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,190
really do about the up the pirating
community and are not as pirating movies

450
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,010
the pirating magazine the magazine that
you I want

451
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,029
is scanned and available for free online
so

452
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,690
of course you know why would you why
would you pay for it that's what a lot

453
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,850
of people say

454
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,320
arm and you know again like the point
point thing I love them to death but

455
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,370
you know when their race in that year
for the Pirate Bay its site now dude

456
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,059
actually lot of people

457
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:48,200
you know bust their ass to make
magazines I 2600 games like Grand Theft

458
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,270
Auto or whatever that's what they do
that's their art and they should get

459
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,330
paid for it

460
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,639
and you know you routing them on I

461
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,720
in my mind is kinda weak you know
Pirates

462
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,840
are not online pirates where

463
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,929
shitty adidas shirts and not shoot from
little boats

464
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,570
are outside a somalia I'm

465
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,730
they're the worst dressed Pirates ever
yeah

466
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:19,590
I if I I mean to get a hearing or some
sheer bliss

467
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,809
you come on next okay so first just said

468
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,918
general statement and I find it really
interesting that

469
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,000
newspapers and TV news channels now are
both

470
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,169
forms journalism that ur you know sort
of forced to transition to this new

471
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:40,570
medium the Internet and i was just
wondering if you could elaborate on what

472
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,120
you fell

473
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,230
was or if they have different charges on
the Internet

474
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,510
interns have would be different charges
and

475
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,580
what's the mission in their website you
know what are they both going after the

476
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,710
same audience

477
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,470
because they're both journalism or now
it's a it's a very

478
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,940
different audience I mean TV news
executives sit around and segment of the

479
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,880
population

480
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,809
and then they they felt other news
stories based on that every

481
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:10,990
every news channel had a different name
for the Iraq war that was branded

482
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,950
trademarked

483
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,539
arm you know they flash across that
horrible

484
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:19,360
a graphic at that the bottom of the
screen so

485
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,590
arm but what are the things that I love

486
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,179
about trying to fill up this 24-hour

487
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,649
TV cable news cycle is when the

488
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:33,880
you have to talking heads and

489
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,559
they will show a screen and the like
this website supporting something

490
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,750
yeah I report and then this really their
Ste they're moving the mouse around and

491
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,940
surfing the internet for you

492
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,820
and s make you know actually I I don't
need you

493
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,590
to make stupid comments while I surf the
net I can do that myself

494
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:58,210
om you can you know focus on interesting
stories like is baloney gannett

495
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:04,029
kill your children and now I'm you know
stop on grapes and fall off the table

496
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:09,039
so am well and it seems like the new
stator

497
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,830
new station web sites are trying to live
up to the level stimulation are you see

498
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,860
on the Internet

499
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,190
and it and newspapers in general

500
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,649
I mean this is a generalization are
trying to stay away from that do you

501
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:21,740
think

502
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,510
that they can survive that way over I
now and again that's why I think we have

503
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,049
an unsustainable relationship mom with
content it some

504
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,639
there was that some journalists the got
together about a year ago

505
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,909
and says issued a statement that

506
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:43,510
newspaper newspapers are now requiring
journalists who would file one story

507
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,080
every

508
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,199
couple of days to be working on that
story but also posting smaller stories

509
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,490
like several a day

510
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,890
are in this mad dash for traffic because
the you know the more traffic we get

511
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,769
them we can sell some or are these

512
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:01,149
great banners the pop-up am

513
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:04,980
and so that working journalists are
having to work even harder

514
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,419
you know the gotta keep the blog now arm

515
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:12,549
and it's like no I would actually like
you to look into that story

516
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:16,519
for a long period of time and then
posted to give me something of quality

517
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:20,010
incident dishing out small bits and
nonsense

518
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,190
next be super question

519
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,690
early when you're talking about
shrinking magazines and small newspapers

520
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,230
shutting down are you talking about the
data journalism for the death of bread

521
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,080
and secondly are as you know the future

522
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,699
is to have this content cartel and
micropayments how does a small guy in

523
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,149
podunk Iowa compete with that

524
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,610
well I think the small guys got to be
part of that the whole

525
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,730
thing and let make it so that anybody
can sign up if you're a content creator

526
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,190
anybody can sign up and if you end up
getting traffic

527
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,070
arm and people are are linking and
looking at your material

528
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,450
then you're getting a cut of the action
so the small newspaper

529
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,799
in oklahoma you know the outskirts of
Oklahoma somewhere

530
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,379
is as get is on the same payment system
is the new york times

531
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,789
to me that's the only way that the that
it will work

532
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:16,600
well as the other part a question %uh
different verses that the well I mean

533
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,059
when I first started reporting about our
technology and the Internet

534
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:24,908
on the radio back in 95 it was funny
when you talk to some people

535
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,929
at Wired magazine they were like I you
know papers

536
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,980
papers dead nobody's gonna be using
paper Mike which print on paper

537
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,990
active don't fuck you what you talking
about

538
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,120
I greeted you know the whole world to be
paperless that you

539
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,210
this concept that the world's gonna be
paperless is crazy I

540
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,880
we're using more paper than we ever have
arm

541
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,140
go to the printer and your in your
office people print some six

542
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,580
stupid shit I and my favorite is when
they print an email Hama read this

543
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,970
how good thanks a lot om you know I
think there is a

544
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,760
people voice said well you know the
newspapers are gonna are going to beat

545
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,100
the print is going to be dead
everybody's going to have a Kindle or an

546
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,250
iPad

547
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,600
I'm sorry but the construction worker on
the way to work is not carry neck and

548
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,100
all

549
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,370
or an iPad they're going to have a
seventy five-cent paper

550
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,640
and a cuppa coffee and %ah

551
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,840
some vitamins next again

552
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,200
up been hazard that construction worker
also has a cell phone now

553
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,399
yes on I am a working journalist

554
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:34,899
and I'm I have noticed

555
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:38,970
in the past few years that the worst
media companies do

556
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,289
the more well-informed the public began
becomes

557
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:45,529
in to that point and essentially why I

558
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:49,919
disagree with a lot of your points is
that the sins that we lay at the feet of

559
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,220
the internet come from media
consolidation

560
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,260
and started long before the internet
really had any impact

561
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,140
I'm right and

562
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,380
found and I I don't see how giving
rupert murdoch

563
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,329
more micropayments is actually going to
fix journalism I just wanna cite a study

564
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:09,929
from I believe 2006

565
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,389
I wanna say you bet I'm known from the
internet

566
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:18,480
I that showed that there were fourteen
thousand stories on Google News covering

567
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,000
twenty five distinct news events

568
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,940
and I have in my head every day that I
work in a freelance journalist at work

569
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,190
for all sorts of different

570
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:31,639
formats but I don't wanna be 14001

571
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,889
in that's where we're at what makes this
sick isn't that things are free that

572
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,700
people won't pay so on and so forth

573
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,099
it said there's too much rib repetition
in the system

574
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,220
and there's no incentive to do novel
things because the way

575
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,389
news directors figure out what's
newsworthy is what's already been

576
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,619
covered

577
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,760
so you get more like this it's like
radio stations they decide what to play

578
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,829
based on one of the stations are planned
yes

579
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,400
I and that's not going to work tonight
what began

580
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,349
great Rupert Murdoch is is an asshole
and you know I like I say I'm a chance

581
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,950
I'm not

582
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:06,680
I'm not saying yea paywalls but what I'm
saying and what isn't un

583
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,690
on arguable fact is that journalists are
getting fired

584
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,760
is that these for news desks are getting
shut down left and right but wouldn't

585
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,770
think that's coming up in the place up
for new debt news dance

586
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:22,390
is global reach of local report great
great global reach and I'm not gonna

587
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,730
get into a %uh long argument with you
yes

588
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,540
we are reading a ton of newspaper
articles this information is going all

589
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,130
over the place

590
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,170
but this concept that it should be free

591
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,390
to me is what I have an issue with and
I'm not here to cuddle I'm not I'm sorry

592
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,299
I'm not here to argue with you about
this is a

593
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,050
circle one way kind of thing now okay
but what I'm saying

594
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,730
what i'm saying is great you you with
you you if you win the battle you're

595
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,720
gonna lose the war

596
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,550
that's why bring up 2600 arm you can say
that

597
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,670
that all these people are consuming this
journalism

598
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,520
but in understand those people are
getting paid for it

599
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,759
this is the biggest ever hope right it's
a nasty

600
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,740
which seems to be a good sign for 2600
as an institution

601
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:14,740
if not for the pimp print edition of the
magazine right

602
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,690
you know that there's this there's this
mentality in the media and it happened

603
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,619
at radio all the time where it people
wanna

604
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:27,860
that they want to pay when fame arm
Satellite Radio's doing right now

605
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,970
as well I where and when I had a
syndicated show

606
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,140
they say what you now well hundreds of
thousands of people are going

607
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,390
hear your product well that's great you
know and I

608
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,690
and ice strive to do a good journalistic
product

609
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,990
but I do this put food on my table

610
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,500
I fame doesn't pay the bills and

611
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,200
you know I I guess my main point of this
is that

612
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,430
whether it's pay walls are micropayment
system or something

613
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,089
now we need to figure out a way to
support good journalism

614
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:04,160
because right now a lot of good
journalism is going away

615
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,540
and we're listening to our mel gibson

616
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,650
upset about a the jacuzzi

617
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,640
on Wow that was a have you ever heard
that when

618
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,770
anyway next their arm so I was running
if you could speak to the current

619
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,980
the current political arm

620
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,510
motivations and net neutrality like
where people

621
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,119
I like meaning what congress maybe thing
you're doing and if there's any

622
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,130
movements that people can support
because

623
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,720
I guess in the end that's who makes the
laws you know the politicians and so

624
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,910
who can we tell the loudest that this is
a bad idea well

625
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,960
I'm explaining things expecially

626
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,180
things about the internets to congress
is brutal

627
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,480
these people don't know enid shit

628
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,520
about the Internet about electronic
rights they're gonna side

629
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,960
on it the the side I love these big
content companies

630
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,660
arm and so we think will help the
democrats will save us right well

631
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,868
the democrats the one that railroaded
through the telecoms Telecommunications

632
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:13,950
Act of 1996 that allowed speaking at you
know the the previous woman's

633
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,770
discussion about media consolidation you
want to talk about

634
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,369
alkyl of that change the media landscape
forever

635
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,590
that law completely screwed us

636
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,660
arm these entertainment companies donate
at Hana money

637
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,359
to the to the democrats and to the
republicans our

638
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:35,710
and they've got the year you know and
then we're when they're like all these

639
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,720
kids are

640
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,369
download more movies you know lettuce I
respect them

641
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:44,990
IOM I think that congress is going to be
listening to them in a lot of ways

642
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,930
more than us so you know you've got to
be loud and you've got to be heard you

643
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,560
got it

644
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,350
contribute to organizations that are
fighting this you

645
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:59,618
alright some from Canada ass on it I
know a little bit that

646
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:04,220
things apart things are done in Canada
and when Canada was faced with

647
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,630
this problem of newspaper not being

648
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,980
trusted do not complete their race to
the bottom

649
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,400
where the produce nothing but both fed
what they did is they borrowed the idea

650
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,770
from from pertain to said

651
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,470
let's create our own version the BBC
we're going to have the government

652
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,180
break off a bunch of people give them
money you going to produce good news

653
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,890
it's essential for the quality of our
democracy

654
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,629
the created to be the CDC here in the
United States

655
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,430
I don't know why people don't think like
that when they were confronted by the

656
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,799
same problem they said

657
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,070
let's create in PR people will send
money and

658
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,490
it will be a charity he will work it has
about one percent

659
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,190
less than one percent of the 801 ritual
here

660
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:54,250
home that's not going to work I'm
thinking of the other source of non

661
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,109
bullshit

662
00:39:55,109 --> 00:40:00,790
in our culture the science establishment
was doing fantastic we're just changing

663
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,970
the world

664
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,080
just producing good and formation

665
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,150
through the scientific process where did
they get their money

666
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:12,700
they get it through the government right
and what do you think of the CBCP

667
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,240
I BBC model I think it's a fantastic man
I was interviewed by the BBC to

668
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,780
I two months ago and compared to
journalists

669
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,050
here wow the difference a
professionalism

670
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,570
is amazing I the fact-checking the goes
on

671
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,210
arm even when they're interviewing
somebody

672
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:35,500
about the I was over there talking to
them about a video game that I worked on

673
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,030
called Red Dead Redemption

674
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,030
and they they will not allow

675
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,480
you too talk too much about I

676
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,470
products on the BBC I you can talk about
the creative process you can talk about

677
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,859
things like that but

678
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:53,990
that the restrictions at the BBC are
phenomenal

679
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,310
and the fact that everybody

680
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:01,460
that the fact there's a TV tax over
there makes whole much sense

681
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:06,990
arm because it funds good content and it
funds get journalism I

682
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,050
you now I don't know how many times I'm

683
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,310
clicking around and I'm reading a
phenomenal article

684
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,450
written by a BBC reporter I i wish we
could

685
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:23,450
replicate that here in the United States

686
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,910
high so I just want to ask you about the
scale of content our content is getting

687
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,270
cheaper to produce

688
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,800
more people have access to the tools to
create content

689
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,859
and I think that might actually push out
some other

690
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,950
AAA movies games and music that

691
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,030
arm have to appeal to the lowest common
denominator often

692
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,680
to actually pull a profit so i was just
wondering if you think that the

693
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,870
distributional production arm

694
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:56,440
will affect you know your vision and how
net neutrality and the future the

695
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,910
Internet is going to work

696
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,180
and whether that's less of a problem for

697
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,430
the content providers in the future well
I think there's always going to be

698
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,980
you know people making

699
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,050
I Q se you know home making movies at
home

700
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,109
that we have we have the capacity now to
make these

701
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:18,640
amazing things however we as a culture
did

702
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,740
tender love the lowest common
denominator at

703
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,000
when I pick up dry by the movie theater
it's shocking to me that anybody's in

704
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,290
there watching

705
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,770
I have had stuff arm because it is

706
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,590
I a lot of it looked as local
low-quality garbage I don't think that

707
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:41,000
that any of that's going to affects net
neutrality what will the fact is that

708
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,590
arm a lot of the content that

709
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,230
that is created is more expensive than
ever to make

710
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,800
arm especially with with film I am video
games

711
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,130
and I really need that though I mean
that's

712
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,370
kinda my point do we really need the
super expensive stuff for good keep

713
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,160
things

714
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,460
smaller more local more personal and
more long tail

715
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,310
well at times the local in the personal
stuff isn't so good

716
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:12,450
Tom there's a up

717
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:15,370
at the end and then there's a lot of
stuff that is done by the major studios

718
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,180
is

719
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,990
is is absolute beauty is that this
Government the movie theaters in that

720
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:20,640
great either

721
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,029
well but there but there are phenomenal
there are phenomenal films I don't see

722
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:24,650
how

723
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,940
you know because we have more stuff how
that affects

724
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,109
the the argument over net neutrality

725
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:35,870
the

726
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,910
I desserts after question to some degree
the logistics

727
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,810
what you are proposing of the US putting
up some kind of unified

728
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,690
pay well for all the on on the news
companies because

729
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:51,530
this is a this far as I see it you
developments in international I for

730
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,970
which I don't see

731
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,960
ever getting through with the way
international state is nowadays

732
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,220
because I mean say CNN even CNN

733
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,690
so they can is me a US company but it
seems to me that ok if the US is going

734
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,960
to see this thing they want to remain

735
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,150
keep yourself free they could just move
there are server bases

736
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,820
overseas their country that the company
is still here but they're hosting on to

737
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,550
be

738
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,900
no other cause another country which is
open up all sorts of litigation

739
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,109
crap for this and even even then arm

740
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:25,210
just from human psychology volume you're
gonna go to the your herd sheep this

741
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:25,690
point

742
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,740
that we are you whether you should or
not but it's probably gonna happen which

743
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,609
means if you

744
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:34,259
start charging for the US aids most USB
will probably get other

745
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,540
our country place the BBC or not that's
ok our world affairs

746
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,190
I would absolutely be it damn near
impossible to implement on

747
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,660
on a global up on a global platform it
and I'm not saying that

748
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,350
that I'm not even advocating that sorta
micropayment system but

749
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:53,600
arm some kinda system good

750
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,690
needs to fund good journalism I i would
i would

751
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,980
you there was no there's no way that you
could pass

752
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,190
BBC like Kennedy here the United States
people throw a tantrum

753
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,359
when you try to give their little
Rugrats health care like I don't want

754
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:09,240
socialism

755
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,280
alright your little stupid kids gonna
die good job since

756
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:19,280
I

757
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,140
Knauer as as I drove home a question on
inside another

758
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,089
I was wondering what your thoughts then
on the sick have been on the consulate

759
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:30,880
Creative Commons at I mean as it applies
says that the law

760
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,740
people I've people at my university for
example I've actually heard

761
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,900
have pushed that the the they were
actually

762
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,089
like to see the intellectual property is
going on tire institution by Creative

763
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:43,890
Commons very much take over almost all

764
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,400
everything and I'm I B

765
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,589
perfect every two hours for particles
going much more to scale than they are

766
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:53,430
now I think the right now the Frick
ridiculous

767
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,759
but I A a good mix of places by a

768
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,280
I'm not exactly sure I search results on
that and I think

769
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,760
credit counselor am I love Creative
Commons and

770
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,020
people dictating you know how that their
content can be used

771
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,490
arm to me makes a lotta sense

772
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,089
the thing that work is a

773
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:18,109
a big issue is Mickey Mouse

774
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,460
I making house and this extension

775
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,530
have keeping things out of the public
domain

776
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:29,990
is criminal I it's disgusting that we as
a culture have have allowed this to

777
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,190
happen when they just keep extending

778
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,680
the years arm on this

779
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,549
and ya I hope that more the Creative
Commons

780
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,620
situation are works out by

781
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,170
you right now the people writing the
laws about content

782
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,830
arm are are not listening to us

783
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:56,460
next I don't close one point in a
question

784
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,000
the point about video games and things
is like I watched the price for video

785
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,790
games galore from thirty dollars to
sixty dollars like

786
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:07,000
we don't have the money to consume a
list of and give people TV

787
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,430
on you have cable TV no no now me
neither mariner

788
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,990
next a by me like

789
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:18,150
when we purchased only purchase video
game for sixty dollars like doom 3

790
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,450
and you know within two levels like I
could predict what's gonna happen I run

791
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,470
around the corners and in behind you
like

792
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,710
and getting enjoyment out of it I just
wish to sixty dollars

793
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,920
sold before forcing me to pay a set
amount

794
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,069
nobody's with yeah and I mean I don't
want to get into that

795
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:37,600
that whole debate is is our is another
whole issue

796
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,569
I am but I mean I would say nobody's
forcing you to

797
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:45,550
to spend sixty dollars on it that's the
only way I can get the games

798
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,330
reno's right so but this is
entertainment was doing it

799
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,620
well let's be clear here at week if we
get

800
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,759
up there's a lot a passion about this
topic

801
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,920
I and II and I brought it up because I
was hoping I hope that we did we can

802
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,350
continue to have a discussion about it

803
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:06,020
I am but wow yes by the democrat but

804
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,390
that but my my point is quickly we're
talking about entertainment

805
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,759
arm it's not food it's not shelter

806
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,880
I it's not things that are Tom that you
have to have to survive

807
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,890
and I i think a lot of times

808
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:25,470
I've caught myself getting a little bit
too wound up about

809
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,550
arm what is and what is in essence a
entertainment

810
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,589
I think we as a culture have gotten way
too drunk on entertainment

811
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:37,120
have that's fine but like I can return
the game once I've opened

812
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,779
dude I know it's capitalism sometimes
you buy stuff in it sucks

813
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,230
its you know read reviews online

814
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,550
that's why we pirate style way you so
you prior it's tough because you don't

815
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,300
want to sock

816
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,530
I so so the yeah

817
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,350
I RI like if I fire is something I like
it I want to stand by I support the

818
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,980
people who make quality content at yeah
I and II

819
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,890
I say the same thing 1 I've pirated
stuff and I never went out bought it

820
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:12,089
or maybe you should I i say i i've heard
this argument before it's nonsense

821
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:15,880
people this whole like well let me all
let me let me let me out let me

822
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,730
said let me consume it and then I'll
decide if I want to pay for it at the

823
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,150
Hey Dude I can't stop it do it go nuts
man

824
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:27,710
that point that's what that's why it I
what why bring up the that the PC gaming

825
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,550
issue this is this is one of the reasons
that a lot of companies

826
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,810
are not making PC games is this
mentality right here

827
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,650
they're gonna focus on the clothes
architecture systems they got more

828
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,780
control over that most people don't know
how to solder a chip

829
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,980
into an X box or a ps3 so they can play
pirated games

830
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,800
so I mean you know I'm not going to
start downloading and

831
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,859
dude pirate pirate your face off but I'm
sane

832
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:55,450
the entertainment industry is reacting
to this and if you're upset

833
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,390
that did the PC gaming landscapes sucks
now compare what it used to be

834
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:07,390
this is the reason sorry

835
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,970
occurred for journalism like there was
an article that was paying only got two

836
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,330
minutes let me get somebody ask another
question sorry

837
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,620
good eyes or make a comment on the
previous guys makin a.m.

838
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,430
I kinda like I've it sounds like a false
choice between Creative Commons I B

839
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,960
is get everybody should give minded I'm
Creative Commons is an alternative

840
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,190
licensing scheme

841
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,250
its it doesn't work without IP we can
get rid of IP laws sets

842
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,319
kinda like a ridiculous choice to prison
right cuz America doesn't make anything

843
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:35,940
now

844
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,460
except for a job a porno in bad movies
and

845
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,830
only am yes

846
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,069
yeah oil spills were pretty awesome
actually

847
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:52,220
I'm I could take it back to journalism
for a moment

848
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,120
on the reason that I do not consume
corporate media and I hope it goes

849
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,279
bankrupt

850
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,540
is that at some point the stop treating
me as the customer is they're treating

851
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,589
me as the product

852
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:07,700
selling me to the advertisers absolutely

853
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,780
he if you want to see you restore
democracy through the fourth the state

854
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,960
before the state needs to function

855
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,440
and in order to function there needs to
be a firm division

856
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,760
between journalism and advertising and
entertainment bureaus

857
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,270
absolutely Wed with news in this country
became a for-profit

858
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,530
situation it used to be a loss leader
you you had to pump

859
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:34,150
have new zone on your network in order
to maintain your license

860
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,480
and that all changed now news makes
money and when news makes money

861
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,540
you're getting sold bullshit and with
that

862
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,800
thank you so much everybody
