1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:06,230
either

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,940
so my name's Phil Lapsley and as some of
you may know I'm

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,570
been working on a book on the history
phone freaking I'm I presented at the

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,400
last hope

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
I and both my wife and the FBI believe
that I'm never going to be done with

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,850
this book but I assure you it will be
done soon

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,890
on but what I'd like to do today

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,760
is arm is talk about the cats and mice
the phone phreaks

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,559
and telephone company in the FBI and
this is great because

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,800
on you know i i tend to come at the
stuff from a little bit of a

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,420
have a history perspective but for them
which is cool about this talk I'm

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,210
excited to give it

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,930
is I get to tell war stories and they
don't even involve me

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,440
this is just wonderful so before we talk

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,680
about the actual stories I do need to
give you a little bit a context

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,390
i'm for those who were actually around
during the 1960s and 1970s doing phone

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,149
free stuff

18
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,260
so I want to give you the background on
who the players are

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm and what they're up to and where to
start with the phone phreaks that is to

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,600
say

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,150
the mines up

22
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,610
so

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,820
what's the phone freak a fun free cuz
the phone hacker right

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,840
and just like how the word hacker kinda
has two meanings writers meeting that we

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,670
tend to use in this crowd which is you
know somebody who likes to explore

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,820
things play with things and polka things

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,330
I'm there's also the hacker meeting
about a person who you know breaks

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,530
computers and writes viruses and
whatever phone phreaks

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,460
same thing rights to the best the best
possible kinda spin on fun being a phone

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,729
freak on phone freaking as is somebody
who's interested in learning about the

31
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,310
telephone network some who is fascinated
by how the phone system works who likes

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,250
playing with it like

33
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,729
exploring it takes great joy and
pleasure in figuring stuff out better

34
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,390
still

35
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,250
figuring out a way to make the phone
system do something that wasn't designed

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,160
to do or is it supposed to be able to do

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,229
and it's just it's a a pure exploration
and

38
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,970
and sort of creative joint the course
there's another

39
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,240
definition of fun free which is in use
and its in some ways a

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,390
equally valid definition at least
certainly you know it its commonly used

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,800
which is a fun free to somebody who
likes to make free phone calls I did

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,649
somebody who wants to rip off the phone
company

43
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,110
who wants to screw up the telephone
network play pranks a you know GM

44
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,150
switches whatever

45
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,150
on so

46
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,310
fun freaking was what still is
commonplace but

47
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,269
that from purposes have this talk in my
book I'm concentrating on 1960 to 1980

48
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:30,840
so this is you know at some level at
this point almost engine history it's

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,600
from history

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,280
to one phone phreaks would fun free to
do what with the tools the trade

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,459
help let's talk about this baby this is
a blue box even though it's not blue

52
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,650
this is from 1964 you note on the dial
there this is a a homebrew

53
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,850
contraption a moment I'll I know if you
can read it says please wait for dial

54
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,459
tone

55
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,049
which is an old thing used to find on on
telephones instructing you because

56
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,340
you're probably weren't familiar with
I'll times back in the day

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,600
on the a the phone company

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,840
in the nineteen thirties based

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,500
its entire signaling system isn't are
switching system on these tones for

60
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,079
controlling the way phone calls worked

61
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,680
and because of that um

62
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,760
if you were able to generate these times
you essentially have the phone

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,179
system at your disposal you can route
calls you could bypass billing equipment

64
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,209
you can do almost anything

65
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,459
I'm this made sense this design that
they did in the nineteen thirties was

66
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,410
really very high tech nineteen-thirties
was first put into operation 1943

67
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,139
and your they didn't realize at the time
that gosh anybody could do this they

68
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:31,150
thought we've actually

69
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,199
big equipment everything else are to be
able to generate these towns

70
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,510
and this equipment is in fact fairly
large arm

71
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,989
by nineteen even by the nineteen sixties
gotten smaller by 1970 was a hand-held

72
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,570
unit you can actually get a blue box

73
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,239
app for the iPhone and right now um you
won't have much luck on the

74
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,470
on the actual telephone network actually
make calls but there is a website you

75
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,620
can go to call project

76
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,769
MF .org where they have lovingly
recreated the old telephone network on

77
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,739
the digital switch

78
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,750
and if you have a blue box application
on your iPhone or Android or whatever

79
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,900
I'm you can you make make blue box calls
their

80
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,799
arm so there were other colored boxes
two black boxes red box and i wanna talk

81
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:12,660
about those

82
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,760
but so this is what phone freaks we're
doing is they're playing around with the

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,720
network they were exploring things
they're building blue boxes making freak

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,260
on phone calls export stuff

85
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,270
so who cared about this other than the
phone phreaks well

86
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,770
for one the phone company cared about it
right

87
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,180
um AT&T back in nineteen sixties

88
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,470
was the largest corporation in the world
I'm

89
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,060
it had employed thousands of people

90
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,810
and it had in made a huge investment in
this telephone switching system only to

91
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,449
find out

92
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,699
that but why we screwed up and might
actually take a billion dollars worth of

93
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,790
investment actually fix this problem so
the phone freeze can use their blue

94
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,470
boxes

95
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,180
and I was back on a billion dollars is
real money so

96
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,960
you know this is not by the way like you
know okay so Microsoft has a security

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,008
flaw will just push out a security patch
know this is an actual like

98
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,460
hard physical goods right you know
switching equipment in central offices

99
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,620
that need to be replaced so this is a
big deal

100
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,780
so AT&T is free unhappy about this whole
thing I don't like the potential for

101
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,979
loss of revenue they don't like this
really at all

102
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,699
now there's another group that cares
about this phone freaking business

103
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,850
and that's the Federal Bureau of
Investigation um

104
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,069
they cared about it for some funny
reasons

105
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,590
first of the technique we had to care
about others along the book called fraud

106
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,580
by wire

107
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,258
and that and and that would make it a
federal crime if a phone call cross

108
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,819
state lines now of course

109
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,419
if you're making if you're going on
Justin's fraud is gonna cross straight

110
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,639
line so it falls to the FBI to do this

111
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,580
but the FBI wasn't super enthusiastic
about becoming AT&T is revenue police

112
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,698
right the FBI didn't want to be AT&T is
watchdog like a disguise ripping us off

113
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,009
you better go out and arrest

114
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,050
writes like outlook we got better things
to do what better things we have to do

115
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,050
well there's organized crime

116
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,710
now this is a photo I got from a guy at
San Francisco State University who has

117
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,909
and interest in academic interest in
bookies and

118
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,300
this is described that the caption for
this photo is high-tech

119
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,789
bookie operation nineteen-thirties which
I love

120
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,860
but if you're a bookie what you do is
you take that from your customers years

121
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,849
actually playing one customer off
against another trying to balance this

122
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:21,009
this thing you have a line that you move
in order to make the best work out what

123
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:21,749
it means is

124
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,969
you're on the phone all the time so if
your bookie

125
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:29,090
you love the idea that you could make
free phone calls cuz that's good that

126
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,249
comes down your cost

127
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:33,289
but you also love the idea that I'm

128
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,330
your phone calls would be untraceable in
the sense that you don't leave billing

129
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,560
records for the turns out one of the big
weapons the FBI had against organized

130
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,680
crime

131
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,520
was looking at billing records and so
they would say okay well this guy talk

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,409
to this guy and this guy talks this guy
discussion on mobster

133
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,840
you know you can fill in the blank right
if using a blue box for black box that

134
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,259
data goes away and Sophia

135
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,860
the FBI while you might not be thrilled
about being AT&T

136
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,849
revenue please your plenty thrilled
about figuring out a way to stop that

137
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,740
data from going away

138
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,509
okay so you got the phone freaks you out
the FBI any of the telephone company in

139
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,849
the so that those are the sort of
players in the drama

140
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:13,199
and with that we can actually get into
the the actual stories here

141
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,919
our first story is in 1962 units from
617 land where 617

142
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,310
Boston right and term

143
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,710
a I'd like to show you will spur is

144
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,919
takes place in the Harvard campus this
is a map of Harvard University in its

145
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,919
surrounds and 2010 is a lovely campus
you should visit

146
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,409
um here's a more interesting map to me
this is a map Harvard campus in that

147
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,879
surrounds in 1962

148
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,150
some looking at telephone tie lines

149
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,770
so what sort of anti line if if you and
I are

150
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,430
companies campuses organizations schools
and we each have our own phones which is

151
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,169
a time line is

152
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,580
nection between those two switches so
instead of actually having to dial your

153
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,090
number

154
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,999
maybe i'd I'll 8 and I get connected to
your phone switch

155
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:04,069
so vis is a a map

156
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,249
how all the phone switches were
interconnected at harvard and its

157
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,059
surrounds kinda hard to read

158
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,059
so clean it up a little bit here and
I'll show it to you

159
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:16,529
I'm it starts off at the top with ninety
control that's referring to the ninety

160
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,039
air defense missile control system which
is then connected to mitre which is a

161
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,460
defense think tank

162
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,080
which is connected to Otis Air Force
Base Lincoln labs

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,539
IBM Hanscom Air Force Base MIT

164
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,140
MIT University BB and the people who
built the original part the original

165
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,789
hardware for the ARPANET

166
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,620
I'm you might remember President
Eisenhower talk to 1961 about a

167
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,419
military-industrial complex you can see
the military-industrial complex here in

168
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,890
1962 right all these people their phone
systems are connected together cuz they

169
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,029
call each other all the time

170
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,680
so this map came from

171
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,529
I'm a group love folks who are known as
the Harvard 5

172
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,060
and 30 from here 105 is actually a

173
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,980
a misnomer is actually the Harvard for
in the MIT one

174
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm but Harvard I guess is better
marketing so

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,220
they get there to get the so um these
guys

176
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,820
were all freshman at Harvard in 1962

177
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,360
they were sir to the first they weren't
necessarily the first phone phreaks

178
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,800
but they were the first we'll grouper
phone phreaks at least I'm aware over

179
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,200
a group for people who pull their talent
and imagination playground

180
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,279
stuff now back that time line chart that
you saw their

181
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,410
back there this was they discovered this
by

182
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,020
a very old venerable phone freak
technique

183
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,750
which is picking up the phone and dial
right you pick up the phone you to dial

184
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,210
tone

185
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,520
I wonder what happens effect this is
this is how phone phreaks always get

186
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,420
into trouble

187
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,990
I wonder what happens if right pick up
the phone and I'll

188
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,150
so they've been doing a lot of stuff
like this but it turns out that a couple

189
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,300
haven't actually been doing stuff

190
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,980
even earlier what I'd like to do is i'd
like to play you a tape recording a ver

191
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,490
a phone call this is from 1960 in order
to

192
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,420
to get this to make sense of this
reporting

193
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,089
a couple things you have to now in the
old days and long-distance network

194
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,910
direct distance dialing the idea that
you could pick up a phone and dial a

195
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,780
long distance number was relatively new
invention

196
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,310
and inside the phone company that these
folks called inward operators

197
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,250
an inward operators basically operators
operator so every big city would have

198
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,900
won

199
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,090
and so you would if you were I know if
you work trying to make a call say to

200
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,370
San Francisco on it was

201
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,710
wasn't going thru you might call your
local operator your local operator we

202
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,580
call San Francisco inward the San
Francisco and we're operator would place

203
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,550
the call for you

204
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,620
and inward operator for great because
they can basically do anything

205
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,350
now if you show up you can customers
can't call in or operators right

206
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,320
but you can if you have a blue box so if
you show up on an operator's position

207
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,880
pretty much you're with the band right
we assume that you've got to be a phone

208
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,180
company person

209
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,630
except for one niggling detail which is
that in those days cuz it's the phone

210
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,050
company all operators are women

211
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,280
you don't see a lot of women in this
group right

212
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,370
so they can't quite pretend to be
operators but they can pretend to be on

213
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,110
a test for

214
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,430
which is essentially a testing position
because in those days again the phone

215
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,040
company

216
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,250
test engineers are all men

217
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,240
so the final thing you need to know is
these guys are starting out in Boston

218
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,240
and with that here's the call

219
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,850
ok

220
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,850
out test for

221
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,210
or sparked a spark could you get my
point

222
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:54,210

226
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:36,560
sensing a pattern yet

227
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,130
work could you get me in little rock

228
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:49,130

I racquet sport of

234
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,699

Ark o'clock hour

235
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,499
a

236
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:08,660
up them

237
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,069
fuck can be a number

238
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,260
it plays that till

239
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,260
want white guy

240
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,390
well charles I

241
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,949
%uh Holloway

242
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,770
crime II

243
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:44,770
pretty good about the circuit for for
for cow

244
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,950
can I get a round of applause please

245
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:59,950
cities

246
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,939
so that's 1960

247
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,110
roughly as the person who made the tape
was not sure who is 1960 1959 he was

248
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,840
actually in high school at the time

249
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,670
so can actually yet gotten Harvard on so
those of you who saw the social

250
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,230
engineering panel last night

251
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,270
you know social engineering long been
used by phone phreaks

252
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,360
it helps if you can come in as an inward
operator you know

253
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,310
in a position where it looks like your
trusted I'm the other thing is funny as

254
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,630
a common phone freak thing later was
tandem stacking where you would use your

255
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,950
blue box to essentially

256
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,710
set up a manual Lincoln on what this is
basically as operator stacking right he

257
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,500
didn't like all around the world
recently called around the US is kinda

258
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:38,810
cool

259
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,270
okay so back to Harvard 5

260
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,790
I'm so these guys by 1962 the freshman
year at Harvard

261
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,430
they've got this pretty well figured out
they figured out the boxes they figured

262
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,550
out black boxes

263
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,640
on they know about these MF towns that
you need to do

264
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,090
they've managed to call the President of
Mexico or try to call him anyway

265
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,390
one night just as a prank arm they
actually at one point a

266
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,900
you need to generate two tones at a time
to make these blue box towns

267
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,990
so they actually did was the organized a
concert in front of a phone using flutes

268
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,430
to try and play in the town's

269
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,470
together although they said one of them
said later that

270
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm it didn't work very well because we
were laughing too much I'm

271
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,060
so there the whole notebook other
experiments

272
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,190
are and which is amazing to me about
these guys is

273
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,610
they figure out stuff that really at
some level would be rediscovered for

274
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,010
another 5-10 years I'm so they were
where where

275
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,460
other time so what happened this is a

276
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,980
recurring theme and phone free stuff
they talk to the wrong people

277
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,440
they talked to a guy who is a friendly
phone company employee

278
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,620
except he turned out not to be so
friendly in fact

279
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,960
he ended up going to telephone company
security because you want to get ahead

280
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,530
in

281
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,689
you know phone company and the phone
company security guy

282
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,230
turned out to be ex-f_b_i_ which is
another thing which happens a lot in

283
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,260
the phone company and fun freaking is a
lot of the security people are ex-f_b_i_

284
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,439
so he called the FBI

285
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,580
now one of the problems

286
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,879
that you have is remember that time line
chart pressured you

287
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,170
right all this defense stuff around and

288
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,620
as an example one things that we do when
they would make those timelines sharks

289
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,450
as they would on they would you know
they call up various operators you call

290
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,490
Hanscom Air Force Base new top talk to
the operator there and after chatting

291
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,440
with her for a few months

292
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,150
what you got on your porch got aboard
accords the plugin I well I got you know

293
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,960
arm I got Stewart Air Force Base I got
room air force base now these guys don't

294
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,430
know from air force bases there

295
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,060
freshman in college answer that's really
weird because what they heard as

296
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,110
Stewart and wrong like wow you can call
Stewart drum how strange just becomes a

297
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,550
joke among the group that

298
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,350
yeah your friends to our drama every
time they have a phone call that start

299
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,520
with this conversation about

300
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,770
you know how is how is you lunch was 20
stewart's doing great how to Romney I

301
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,040
just became the shtick they do

302
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,629
so one night they're having dinner and

303
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,010
one of them says the other guy I'm 51
see the Dean tomorrow at 10 a.m.

304
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,580
and the other is out this week %uh a
weird time for us to see the game

305
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,790
tomorrow at 10 a.m. to

306
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,530
and they kinda look at each other and
and I find their their compatriot

307
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,010
his first to see the team tomorrow at 10
a.m. as is the fourth they called a

308
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,970
friend at MIT

309
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,580
oddly enough at a separate campus he is
supposed to see the dean at 10 a.m.

310
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,570
as well and at the dean's office the
next 8-10 a.m.

311
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,970
their new demands to be seen really
they're just FBI agents Graham

312
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,590
humorless FBI agents who are certain
that they've stumbled on expiring

313
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,060
wire this service well

314
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,060
they've got map serve you know ninety
missile control telephone systems in

315
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,830
this and that

316
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,790
and at one point on says you know says
look we know we know that you have

317
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,220
people inside tell us about Stewart drum

318
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,250
and they say

319
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,530
no no Stewart and Jerome is a joke and
they said oh this is no joke

320
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,570
so um you know worn-out

321
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,280
windup okay and I'd like to just read
you probably can't read this but this

322
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,350
is a one of the Harvard 5 this is his
freshman

323
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,440
advisers I a valuation Cardiff

324
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,970
have him as a freshman students can read
it here son so has been an enigma to me

325
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,790
all year.

326
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,899
I've spent more time with him trying to
understand his problems than

327
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,010
the combined time I've devoted all my
other freshmen devisees

328
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,210
in an attempt to arouses motivational is
my entire bag of tricks to little avail

329
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,830
then suddenly two weeks ago always made
clear we learn from the FBI and

330
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,240
telephone company is tampering with the
whole telephone system

331
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,480
instead of studying night after night
all year long he and three other Harvard

332
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,900
students with the cooperation

333
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,020
MIT student have been discovering ways
to beat the telephone company and how

334
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,629
the whole system works

335
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,910
no wonder his studies have suffered from
what I now know he's been pursuing the

336
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,990
Centers for years

337
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,010
if you want settles down really applies
himself there's no question in my mind

338
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,100
that he can do the work

339
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,160
in fact he possesses vast knowledge of
electronics in general on the telephone

340
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,610
operation in particular

341
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,910
surely they should stand him in good
stead now my

342
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,360
favorite line on this year's arm
probable concentration probable major

343
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,510
engineering sciences do you consider
this a wise choice

344
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:08,510
two ish the adviser rights I'm inclined
to think so now

345
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,910
alright so what I'm trying to do I we
have been trying to figure out as we go

346
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,510
through this with this kinda keep track
other cats and mice in their playbook

347
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,540
so you what are the lessons we can learn
from this cat

348
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,550
so the PlayBook here for the telco on
the FBI is

349
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,480
first of take defense in espionage issue
seriously somebody's breaking into your

350
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,030
you know claims to be breaking into our
looks like they might be breaking into

351
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,820
your defense thing you want to take that
seriously

352
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,939
the second thing is informants your
friends right your lot a good

353
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,210
information from informants people tend
to talk

354
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,580
on the phone phreaks side the lessons
learned are dusk with anything that

355
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,310
looks remotely like defense for
espionage because of

356
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,679
and informants are not your friends time

357
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,190
alright

358
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,300
so our next time our next story is

359
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,680
in 305 land Miami

360
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,180
that's right and this is a 1969 so this
is this is seven years later

361
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,490
and it involves John Gracia I'm

362
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,730
joy bubbles sense the mid 90's

363
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,300
so joy levels up was a

364
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,290
disputes one of the stars ron rosenbaum
article on Esquire magazine in 1971 con

365
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,250
secrets a little blue box which was the

366
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,700
the magazine that sorta brought phone
freaking into the mainstream

367
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,390
he was actually the time is twenty two
years old he had already been described

368
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,670
by rosenbaum is the granddaddy in the
phone phreaks

369
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,780
on guy has been blind since birth I

370
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,460
he has you know been interested in

371
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,760
telephone since he was little kid
unfortunate passed away in 2007

372
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,000
super nice guy super just interesting I

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,450
I and in 1968 when he was in college she
drew widespread national attention was

374
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,240
written up in the

375
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,830
in the newspapers and actually got on TV
for being able to actually

376
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,520
whistle free phone calls so you need a
blue box if you just whistle 2600 hurts

377
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,900
and my with some polls that he could
actually make a call on a few you too

378
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,470
if you could do a google or look on
youtube for joy global verge on dress

379
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,290
you can find a video of him making these
free phone calls

380
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,550
so its 1969 his home from school he's
actually just been in trouble with the

381
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,490
you know it's gotten gotten you're
busted by the phone company got in

382
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,110
trouble getting all the attention

383
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,630
but it's summer his home from school if
your phone free what do you do when

384
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,830
you're home from school

385
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,620
you play with the telephone and so the
thing that he had figured out how to do

386
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,050
tom is again a social engineering thing
which is arm

387
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,070
he would do something called an openSUSE
lead conference circuit

388
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,689
now an open sleeve Lee conference
circuit now what this has to do with is

389
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,380
in the phone

390
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,360
within the telephone company central
office you've got tip and ring which are

391
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,580
the voice signals and there's a sleeve
lead which basically says at some level

392
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,990
is this line busy

393
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,960
by opening those two things by opening
the the sleeve lead you can actually

394
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,690
cause multiple lines to get conference
together this is sort of a non technical

395
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,840
explanation but it'll do

396
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,570
so the key thing though is that you have
to be able to talk somebody at the

397
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,980
central office you have to be able to
call the switch man

398
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,480
and know what you're doing enough to get
into US and more importantly sound like

399
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,690
you know what you're doing enough to get
him to do this

400
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,860
this was not really a problem for joe
joe pretty much had this kind of thing

401
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,200
wired

402
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,130
so he he was able to call it is local
central office and create these

403
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,500
conference numbers that people could
dial into

404
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,380
in particular it was on him another fell
on the phone freak

405
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,700
by name RJ they were spending a lot of
time talking on these conference calls

406
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,040
unfortunately it runs out and this is
another recurring theme

407
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,950
the phone company I got suspicious and
was listening

408
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,230
and the phone company security agent in
Miami

409
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,840
was axe FBI

410
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,070
and so well he heard this he heard gosh
I'm

411
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,770
mention a Otto von which is a military
telephone system

412
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:56,000
I and so he called the FBI and they
started an investigation

413
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,450
the this is a letter from Herbert Hoover

414
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,780
the director of Stevie J edgar hoover on
J

415
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,389
J edgar hoover a to john erlichman the
council to the president and it was also

416
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,790
sent to the Secret Service

417
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,570
I and it's essentially a report on the
investigation they did on Brescia they

418
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,480
really couldn't prove anything

419
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,940
and so it didn't really go anywhere but
it's just interesting thing on August 27

420
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,370
1969 the spirits Kansas City office with
confidentially advised that blah blah

421
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,490
blah blah blah

422
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,370
on that these guys have a allegedly
discovered a means to intercept

423
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,750
telephone calls transmitted over the
defense communications agencies are von

424
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,710
voice network

425
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,670
automatic voice network audubon and the
wider a telephone service

426
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,720
we don't know whether that actually done
it or not but they say they can

427
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,800
so again answer to that that same lesson
that comes up right

428
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,070
love you know if you the phone company

429
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,710
wiretaps your friends and you take
defense and that's been our stuff

430
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,050
seriously if this guy says that he can
break into

431
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,210
into government communications stuff you
better pay attention that you better

432
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,679
investigative

433
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,910
and on the phone for each side shut up

434
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,990
heck right it's not just that you don't

435
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,090
screw with anything that looks remotely
like defense rescue you don't talk about

436
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,889
screwing

437
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,070
you even think about it right I'm you
know just just

438
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,580
be quiet about that you see this this
comes back to haunt us later

439
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,360
ca alright

440
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,870
for our third area gonna go to for 15
which is

441
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,160
San Francisco and I'm gonna play another
tape

442
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,630
mercifully it is free for them the
previous one you heard

443
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,760
I'm all I can say the audio quality is a
better

444
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,230
novak

445
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,810
back ca handbag wanna talk

446
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,309
somebody there I

447
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:56,530
FBI get no makeup bag

448
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,470
fire

449
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,289
right yeah

450
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,500
alright so that's a call

451
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,700
from the FBI's San Francisco field
office to the Santa Cruz County

452
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Sheriff's Office

453
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,230
I and there's nothing unusual about that
right the FBI calls

454
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,530
very sheriff's offices all the time and
see I see by the way is a National Crime

455
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,740
Information Center

456
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,990
I so you know this is just an FBI agent
checking on the whereabouts of some guy

457
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,809
that they're trying to find no big deal
there

458
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,830
arm the big deal

459
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,049
though is that this was wiretapped

460
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,440
iPhone freak damn so

461
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,659
that tape recording that you just heard
was a

462
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:45,400
wiretapping not just a wiretap it turns
out to be a remote wiretap it was not a

463
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,580
guy sitting there with test leads
clipping on

464
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,379
a so this is actually reporting have a
telephone call that occurred without the

465
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,539
FBI or the

466
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,799
Santa Cruz a county sheriff knowing
about this okay

467
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:03,470
that's that's a big deal I'm you can
imagine that the FBI's knock-kneed

468
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,880
the real enthusiastic about that idea
okay

469
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,679
um so who

470
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,789
who would do such a thing who who would
who have the audacity

471
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:20,510
to wiretap the FBI so

472
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,250
there's there's really I would guess
there's one guy who might have done it

473
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,970
and the FBI would have told you that is
one guy who's actually in the audience

474
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,679
right now

475
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,679
and perhaps you'd like to stand up and
take a bow

476
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,850
so that that's john draper AK Captain
Crunch

477
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:52,700
now this was another one of the stars of
the ron rosenbaum article

478
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,270
out the the secrets little blue box and

479
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,450
a as a result

480
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,490
love the publicity that he got from the
secrets a little blue box article

481
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:09,020
I he was arrested 1972 for making a
phone call to Australia to a radio

482
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,590
station

483
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,690
and ended up getting convicted for that
getting a suspended sentence and so in

484
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,100
1975

485
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,000
he was on I probation so this is sort of
a nifty thing

486
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,760
now um but

487
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,230
we've got this tape and we've got this
intercepted call

488
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,730
and so what are the questions that comes
up is how is such a thing possible

489
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,680
how is it possible for iPhone free with
a blue box to remotely wiretaps the FBI

490
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,060
and there's a couple different ways even
ask that question the first one is a

491
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,129
any technical level the technical level
is

492
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,340
how technically have that work in the
answer is it turns out due to a

493
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,230
configuration

494
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,870
the telephone switch and the San
Francisco Bay Area if you had a blue box

495
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,690
you need this you just need only a blue
boxing in the connect up to San

496
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,730
Francisco and then if you knew the three
digit code 127

497
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,410
and then a a seven digit phone number
that you wanted actually connected

498
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,700
that's what you need now didn't work for
every seven digit number in the San

499
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,710
Francisco Bay Area

500
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,140
but it turns out randomly the 552

501
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,420
2155 which is the FBI field office

502
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,080
that happens to be one of the ones that
did work for on

503
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,189
and you can kind of imagine from there
it's kinda how things go

504
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,270
right it's just it's sort of their serum
often there's a flame you know it's just

505
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,180
you you can't help yourself really

506
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:35,500
on I John's actually doing a pompous
over there yeah

507
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,390
I'm now and it turns out to be a little
bit more

508
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,060
I mean the you know why would such a
thing even even and why would the phone

509
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,720
company allow such a thing the answer is
how many people here

510
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,560
remember what busy signal sound like you
only get them anymore but you do

511
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,669
occasionally right so if you'd call a
busy phone number

512
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,450
on maybe it's busier maybe the person of
the phone off the hook and so used to

513
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,600
have a a service called verification
where you'd ask the operator could you

514
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,830
please verify that this number is
actually busy

515
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,760
and so that's what this service was for
it was for allowing the operator to

516
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,480
actually check the number is busy and
she

517
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,810
if she dialed this using her her
operator keypad she would be connected

518
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,360
to the phone line in question

519
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,600
and she would here in cryptid speech
would be scrambled speech so she

520
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,730
wouldn't be able to tell what's going on
she could tell that somebody actually

521
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,760
was talking on actually the report back
to you the other ones really actually

522
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,420
news now if it was an emergency you
could tell the operator hey I needed a

523
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,050
break in

524
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,250
in which case she would connect up just
like before but she'd hit bring forward

525
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,820
which would send a little burst the 2600
hurts down the line at that point who

526
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,510
the the encryption goes away and now
you're actually on the line now there's

527
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,260
a beep

528
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,210
that is supposed to be generating
letting the people know we're now on

529
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,790
your line

530
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,000
that beep turns out to be pretty faint I
know if you guys heard it

531
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,620
in the in the San Francisco to Santa
Cruz call

532
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,680
it is indeed very faint I think with a
pair of headphones I can pick it out

533
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,230
every so often be it real quiet

534
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,050
in addition of course for law
enforcement agency you probably have a

535
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,510
beef like that anyway so when you hear
you're probably not thinking anything

536
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,600
big okay so that's the technical
question have

537
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,320
how is such a thing possible to
technical level there's a different

538
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,020
question that comes up which is more
like if you're

539
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,210
the say special agent in charge San
Francisco field office for the assistant

540
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,360
director the FBI labs for

541
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,030
clarence kelly the director of the FBI
it's more like how the hell is this

542
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,889
possible

543
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,230
what is wrong with these people and AT&T
this this can't be

544
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,320
and so a letter ends up getting sent

545
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,730
I from the director of the FBI to the
chairman is AT&T

546
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,290
I am advised that information just
developing confirm discloses a condition

547
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,440
which permits any knowledgeable person
using a blue box to intercept and

548
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,340
monitor telephone conversations to and
from the San Francisco FBI office

549
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:55,340
this is the most alarming situation a

550
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,750
people that I've talked to who are
familiar with the investigation

551
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,920
at the FBI their their friends was all
hell broke loose

552
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,610
I'm you there the year 1 comment was

553
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,550
as the agent for told you solve this you
solve a quick

554
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,480
you figure out who did it you figure out
how he did it you make sure it never

555
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,850
happens again

556
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,690
this was a big deal the FBI

557
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,940
so how you solve it

558
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,810
well what we learned thus far was a
great way to solve a case

559
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,679
informants exactly something only way to
solve a case but it's a good way to

560
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,420
solve a case

561
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,720
was another thing that we've learned is
a good way to solve the case

562
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,680
wiretaps exactly right so

563
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,410
for several months after this happens
this was an made 1975

564
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,030
the FBI spends a lot of time trying to
figure out

565
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,550
you know how do we how do we the phrase
was good it wasn't just viewed as

566
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,260
just a John Draper thing this was a
phone freak problem

567
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,370
specifically as they were for to an FBI
memos it was

568
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,940
the underground phone phreaks and Steph
BI agents were instructed to quote

569
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,380
penetrate the underground phone phreaks

570
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,530
so you recruit informants

571
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,290
you do wiretaps one of the problems you
run into some time with informants

572
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,540
is that informants don't particularly
want to testify

573
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,600
and in some cases you may not want your
informants testify

574
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,830
right because you're informants maybe
pre pretty well placed within whatever

575
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,440
circle they runnin

576
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,530
and so informants help you but they
don't always help you think they may

577
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,690
actually help you get fax I'm actually
help you figure out who did this they

578
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,970
may actually in fact get a tape
recording

579
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,370
a call being intercepted but that alone
may not be enough to actually get you

580
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,350
anything like a conviction

581
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,600
and so the FBI had a lot of problems and
was trying to juggle with

582
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,730
now at the same time

583
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,330
um they became aware love another
problem

584
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,460
um anyone recognize this or to keep add

585
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,150
okay so this is Otto von this is the
automatic voice network does the

586
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,800
military phone system

587
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,930
I this is actually a fake keypad

588
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,140
I'm its somebody has built an autumn on
pay phone keypad

589
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,270
but it sorta illustrates the idea which
is the autobahn phones don't just have

590
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,800
the normal 12 buttons are used to they
have this nice

591
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,280
red column on the right hand side the
letters stand for flash override flash

592
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,710
immediate priority

593
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,240
and if replacing president's calls if
the country is under attack or

594
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,280
you know whatever bad thing has happened
and it's not a it's not a secret network

595
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,380
it's not a secure network even but it is
the military's phone system

596
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,700
and you know they took it pretty
seriously

597
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:37,530
so around the same time around and 1975
beginning in 1976 the FBI's getting

598
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,910
reports that phone phreaks have been
hacking and

599
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:44,690
to the Autobahn network and they don't
like that

600
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,470
and in particular one of one of their
their sources tells them

601
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,050
well you know you know who knows all
about this is John Draper guy knows all

602
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,929
about this stuff

603
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:58,040
and so now it's like okay so we got
retrievers wiretapping us

604
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,140
we are breaking and Audubon week we
gotta do something about this

605
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,259
so you know it's you redouble the
efforts you were born for miss you do

606
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,090
more wiretaps you get the phone company
more involved than they already are

607
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,270
there's a bunch of stuff that happens
around this time

608
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,430
which is really unclear from the people
i've talked to i get lots of different

609
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,290
confusing

610
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,820
contradictory versions of the story I
think part of the problem is

611
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,390
not necessarily everybody has the
complete picture or if they do perhaps

612
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,960
are not saying

613
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,560
on you can go to John Drapers website

614
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,779
I and you can read a version of the
story

615
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,130
arm one other versions of the story is
that

616
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,480
he he Draper ends up getting set up by
an informant

617
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,510
I another version of the story is that
no

618
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,960
he see John Draper just end up making an
illegal call

619
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,580
but much like getting um al capone for
income tax evasion what the FBI

620
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,190
eventually managed to get

621
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,300
Cap'n Crunch for was simply making a
couple have fun phone calls with a blue

622
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,260
box

623
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,430
I'm no Otto von no wiretapping know
anything else just your basic

624
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,330
garden-variety fraud by wire charges

625
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:15,110
and that was enough for them they were
happy at that point because what they're

626
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,300
really wanted

627
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,540
the side sorta making front for example
and getting him to not do this anymore

628
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,690
was to get a chance to talk to them and
debrief him and find out

629
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,620
exactly how I did this morning new
analyst other stuff

630
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,950
so indeed a on April 2nd 1976

631
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,640
the FBI knocked on john draper store and
ended up

632
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,250
arresting him and I serving

633
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,360
for months along park is that right so
so he ended up going to a

634
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,130
going to prison I think the first phone
for it to actually go to prison for

635
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,400
making an illegal phone call

636
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,550
so

637
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,730
what we learn well

638
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,040
the first thing is that you take report
secure communication system being

639
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,529
on seriously right if you're the FBI or
the telephone company

640
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,930
if somebody if somebody is allegedly
wiretapping your calls

641
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,930
you take that seriously that's a big
deal

642
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,310
now the second thing is I didn't mention
this but

643
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,880
when the FBI went to the phone company
and said this guy's

644
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,560
breaking into our system he's his
listening to our phone calls they set

645
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,000
out some possible

646
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,200
and this is another thing that comes up
a lot right now possible

647
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,850
absolute not possible well don't believe
people when they tell you things are

648
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,100
possible because one thing we always
learns that things are always possible

649
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:36,380
it may not be in a way the anticipated
but it's possible

650
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,200
on the phone for Exide you don't
wiretapping FBI

651
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,890
you just I know it's tempting II

652
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:48,310
believe me I know it's tempting but you
know you don't

653
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,730
alright so that's actually my air

654
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,960
my formal talking want to save a lot of
time for questions here but I didn't

655
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,410
wanna

656
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,500
make some thanks I want to thank the
many phone phreaks

657
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,260
telephone company in law enforcement
people who help me I'm via interviews in

658
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
providing materials

659
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,620
in particular I want to thank the
Harvard five for a lot of their archival

660
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,650
material and photos and things

661
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,130
and then a few people who provided some
photos that were that I and after

662
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,720
swiping of the net but they were
Creative Commons

663
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,070
I no caps from mice were harmed and in
this production

664
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:25,070
so I'm questions

665
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,250
ifill

666
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,570
great shock thank you I understand
you're working on a book documenting all

667
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,570
this could you explain a little bit
about to the progress that that the

668
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,330
project

669
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,480
how long you been working on it or where
it's going in a when we might see in

670
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,440
I'm you should put away from my check to
clear before actually asking questions

671
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,810
like that that's such a good question

672
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,920
I'm so been working on this book for
actually

673
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,350
quite a while I I started in 2005
part-time employees now working on it

674
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,060
full time

675
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,250
I my target as a hundred thousand words
I'm at forty-five thousand words at this

676
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,980
point I'm

677
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,650
pretty much done with the research I'm
just actually no sorry and Mike a

678
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,650
recovering alcoholic

679
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,150
I am done with the research I really am
I'm

680
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,370
a so I'm about halfway through the
writing I would figure that the book

681
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,650
will be finished by the end of this year
certainly

682
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,690
I and that and then

683
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,390
what that means is that it'll be done
it'll be actually imprint sometime in

684
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,509
2011 I don't know when it's sorta
depends on the publishing schedule

685
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,700
so not not decided yet so

686
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,370
her to was a question um on our

687
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,150
on the timing on our multi3 I heard that
during the

688
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,740
mid-seventies it wasn't so there was
some modifications that were made

689
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,740
are on the Multi freak timing as one if
you have any information about that sure

690
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,400
so the commuters explain the question a
little bit um

691
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,460
when you're sending out these
multi-frequency polls blue box towns

692
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,900
you can send them just like as if you're
dialing a touchdown pad and so you know

693
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,890
wonder one or two pulses per second are
but of course the telephone company

694
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,670
equipment actually sends faster it's
more like about 7 pulses per second

695
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,770
and one of the ways that they thought
they could detect fraud

696
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:22,180
was by looking at the pulse rate so if
somebody is setting up horses that are

697
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,279
very slow or

698
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,750
or not timed correctly that may be an
indicator fraud and

699
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:31,010
that is true that is an indicator fraud
more though it was mostly a

700
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,220
indicator about equipment somewhere in
the network and so

701
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,300
certainly if you're using manual gearbox
you might be generating trouble cards

702
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,600
the various which is ready for actually
these

703
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,600
these idea my cards to print out trouble
reports but from the people i've talked

704
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,610
on telephone company security they said

705
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,850
yes you know for the most part this
which meant not really interested not

706
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,860
with a mostly just wanted to do was for
this problem to go and usually their

707
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,410
first thought was well this is just an
equipment malfunction if you're

708
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,720
generating hundreds of them because
you're using a lot

709
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,120
eventually that might get to security
but they said I wasn't really the most

710
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,790
effective way of detecting

711
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,390
you know a blue box use what was
actually

712
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,779
what mark much more effective was people
would call a 555 1212 numbers to make a

713
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,710
blue box call

714
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,920
and the thing is 555 1212 number should
never

715
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,640
return answering supervision and
telephone company lingo they should

716
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,799
never look like the answer

717
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,460
but when you redirect the call with a
blue box it goes to a number that

718
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,680
doesn't answer and that was

719
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,240
as one as one telephone company engineer
but he said that's immediate bird dog

720
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,980
but something fraudulent is taking place

721
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,190
so this bill I was wondering I'm a fan
of the audio

722
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,080
progress made by Evan doorbell yes I was
going through massive archive them I

723
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,120
haven't image have

724
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,839
the Freak known as Evan doorbell if I'm
sorry repeat button if I was wife you

725
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,930
might have it image

726
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:47,049
02 I do not have an image 11 or 11 or
mel is a

727
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:52,030
is a a from the reclusive guys I've
never seen an image

728
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,390
Evans not his real name on but he has
done some

729
00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:00,640
amazing amazing audio material on I
talked on the phone a couple times you

730
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,839
should all if you're interested in this
sort of thing which I

731
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
hope you are a few just after 45 minutes
other on

732
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,410
I would go to fun trips dot com and you
can download

733
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,200
a specifically event or bill has a
series called how I became a phone freak

734
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,600
it's about six parts now

735
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,970
is wonderful it's like listening to this
American life for phone phreaks

736
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,910
I'm and then if you're a little bit
harder core there is a thirteen or

737
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,549
fourteen part series called sounds have
long distance which is basically tape

738
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,270
recordings that are narrated by Evan

739
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,350
I love how the old long-distance network
sounded what is a crossbar switch sound

740
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:34,560
like when it cuts over the sort of thing
is great so thank you

741
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,890
thank you in there

742
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,040
do you plan to get into anything work
temporary

743
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,400
in your book you know it's kind of
interesting that the things that you

744
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,150
brought up

745
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,030
are all actually possible today water

746
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,980
additional switches especially some
wipes right

747
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,820
so at it was a couple thoughts on that
one is

748
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,910
a that from many in the modern day fun
fix that i've talked to

749
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,730
because I am focusing on the 1960 1980
paired it with one thing since

750
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,780
do not whatever you do do not tell
people the phone freaking is dead

751
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,350
it's not dead we still do phone freaking
and that makes sense I think as long as

752
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:17,020
their telephone networks are going to be
people who want to explore

753
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,910
miss you know back to that first slide
talking about what a fun treat asthma

754
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,379
love exploration

755
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,780
I'm and to your comment that this stuff
is still possible

756
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,540
I really I take your word for that I
completely believe it in particular I

757
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,240
know that on a lot of the one of the big
problems has been the law enforcement

758
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,020
access right for wiretapping

759
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,020
what your law enforcement needs
legitimate way they claim to be able to

760
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,009
wiretap calls

761
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,830
but if they can do that it turns out
other people can do it too ass like goat

762
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:43,770
see

763
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,820
indeed on so I'm not

764
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,610
the most family planning on doing in my
book is talking about in a kind of an

765
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,910
epilogue chapter

766
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,580
you hear about to themes kinda like
we're talking about here that come up

767
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,810
from the 1960 1980 period kinda how they
apply

768
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,660
a you know to the modern day but I'm not
really planning on covering any in the

769
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,140
modern stuff and I'm actually kinda
embarrassed I just don't know that much

770
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,220
about the modern stuff although I do
have an asterisk Swisher

771
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,760
so thank you

772
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,300
so I noticed that you definitely
obscured names

773
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,320
the Harvard people yes

774
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,370
can you not to ruins and in the

775
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,770
your some major piece if your book
obviously but

776
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,710
eight can you give us a little bit more
about well they went on to be

777
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,110
engineers are they did sister they did
that or or

778
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:39,160
you know how many of them are still
alive then and things like that

779
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,560
they went on to be engineers they did
this and they did that several former

780
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,500
standouts are

781
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,900
I I'm know I was in action and I'm not
actually trying to

782
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,830
to obscure anything in terms of the
story in the book is just more out of

783
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,890
privacy that you know they don't want
their name

784
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,680
out there on so I'm they actually

785
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,569
would see love the Five Guys all of them
went on to become engineers

786
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:05,330
all them had very successful careers in
and done good things

787
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,560
um one of them has passed away sadly

788
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,270
on the rest are still alive and

789
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,250
and they're just all happy fun great
people

790
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,060
and and it was really kinda fun you know
tracking down actually chatting with

791
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,200
them they had a they had a great time
reminiscing

792
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,700
did to they still talk to each other
regularly read it is it

793
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,040
regularly pay for the phone calls they
do indeed there for the phone calls and

794
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,000
and regularly is too strong a word but
they they definitely do talk to each

795
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,220
other

796
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,300
you said you omitted you research on
black boxes

797
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,070
and possibly with boxes from your book
not from the book just from the stalk

798
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,030
purchases yet okay if you have any
documented were anecdotal

799
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:51,850
you know information on was a foreign
intelligence

800
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,089
penetration into the system using black
box in

801
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,720
great question am this is something that
did a

802
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,040
I think should be really worrisome and
in fact actually that was there is

803
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,830
definitely

804
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:07,020
from the the 1975

805
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,960
wiretapping the FBI there was definitely
a concern about that

806
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,400
right that you know gosh if Cap'n Crunch
can do it then probably the soviets can

807
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,340
do it too

808
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,630
on although I think that was actually
almost in the back on just because they

809
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,370
were still reeling from the idea that
anyone could do it right

810
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,420
on it seems to me like

811
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,510
you would be you we as a country would
be super concerned about that

812
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,780
oddly enough it doesn't seem to be the
case and I actually

813
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,590
talk to some folks who are familiar with
the matter from an essay

814
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,960
and they said II yes that's the
commercial

815
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,000
phone system we don't deal with
commercial things

816
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,400
we don't worry about that we worry about
a you know things like

817
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,260
you know the military phone system and
even then we mostly just worry about

818
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,980
things are interested because that's
what we do

819
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,070
so on so it's sort of like there is no
one really watching the store other than

820
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,370
AT&T

821
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:03,240
and I think AT&T you definitely took
seek receive communications

822
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,820
as a important thing right they
instructed employees on it and this

823
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,880
this pacific telephone thing that
allowed this wiretapping to happen was

824
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,460
not for AT&T policy this wasn't
something I was everywhere in the

825
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,290
country

826
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,730
arm but there it's an interesting thing
because and Steph rice me as I was doing

827
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:17,410
a psych Wow

828
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,310
gosh it seems like if you know it seems
like this would be a real concern I

829
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,890
haven't found anything that actually
began

830
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,910
really was on anybody's radar no freedom
no further than the

831
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,299
information

832
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,190
this nothing nothing it's turned up
anything so

833
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:34,589
thanks sure filter cattles

834
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:38,420

838
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:49,150

dollars that is fantastic sure thank you
for doing that and

843
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:06,420
and is there me ask you a question are
there any plans

844
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,609
to do there is the best to 2600 that was
published a couple years ago

845
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:13,680
are there any plans to do any sort of
the printed I i'm

846
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,359
despite being a high tech guy I like
printed things is there any plans for

847
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,299
printed version

848
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,680
I was at the broadcaster off the hook
you up at night

849
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,319
and major that manual brought in his
publisher

850
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,700
and so I got in pretty good with her and
give

851
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,530
captive just markedly here at the
conference so I

852
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,760
made wind up putting something out the
trees myself

853
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,260
that would be awesome thank you the just
as

854
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,960
as background for those who don't know
it on there is a newsletter started in

855
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,579
1971 called your pool

856
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:47,299
I was an offering to the youth
international party as the youth

857
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,720
international party line

858
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,200
and that was the phone freak part the
yippies

859
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,369
and that eventually became tap which

860
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:58,549
Cheshire was one of I think there were
three editors al Bell

861
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:02,730
I'm Thomas and Cheshire I and that was
essentially the forerunner

862
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,339
2600 and its its wonderful stuff when
you

863
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:10,529
flipped through it and you see the stuff
from 1971 to 1980 roughly

864
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,559
it just is it's like taking a societal
core sample hackers and phone phreaks

865
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,260
over the years it's really fun to read

866
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:23,260
other questions alright well thank you
very much
