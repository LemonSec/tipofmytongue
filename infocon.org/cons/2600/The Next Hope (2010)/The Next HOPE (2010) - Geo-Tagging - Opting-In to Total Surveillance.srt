1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,740
I run thanks for coming I and my name's
pas pas that

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,960
I do have a last name I'm a grad student
I'd give it anybody first

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,710
I'm a a grad student right now and i'm
looking at geo-tagging and social media

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,740
and in particular I've been looking at
Twitter but I've been chatting with

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,210
people

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,689
other other services and so I've been
doing a project the tool to website

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,650
aggregates tweets and a and show you
some examples would have been doing with

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,010
it

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,480
I'm not gonna die live because an
interest in at work with my my laptop

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,049
but a

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:35,839
if you wanna see it feel free to come
check me after and we'll go somewhere

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,230
grab a beer around I'm

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,300
so the quick overview wanna talk about I

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,300
she give you a quick intro to social
media I'm sure everyone here knows what

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,059
Twitter is

16
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:50,239
but as for measurements on the same page
than a scare you with what I've been

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:50,690
doing

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,419
and make you rethink using you taking if
you've been doing it and I know some

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,980
people here at the conference have been

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,059
ass maybe a rethinking FTC this I

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,890
and then once again that scared you and
try to cheer you up a bit with some good

22
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,920
aspect to do you take so it's not all
bad news

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,290
and is a balance and I think it's
important that we take a look at that

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,150
and then after that I can I'll be around
you can chat we can go for beers

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,380
I am sore here some

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,500
typical social media sites like I
mention I'm focusing primarily on

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,110
Twitter

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,549
for my project I but a chat with people
before spring Yelp which are set to let

29
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,110
you check into locations

30
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,049
or give reviews restaurants things like
that

31
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,310
which are basically social media and
your can you taking your location if you

32
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,780
check in

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,090
your hope and I think I saw the somebody
is the mayor hope so

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,880
so that's one example and then Flickr is
another one that you might not think I

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,780
visit you taking social media say

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,939
but if you taking lots of photos you can
embed your year

37
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,100
GPS coordinates in them if using an
iPhone for example

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,380
and then when you upload them to Flickr
can expose that for you and

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,329
that's getting a bad thing and I was so
there's one big social media said

40
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,180
missing from this list countries because
its absence and I'll talk about it a bit

41
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,930
later

42
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,820
it doesn't really have to you taking
right now I but is can be a problem in

43
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,329
the future

44
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,979
think so for somebody that just got the
first

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,959
smartphone right and a good they got an
iPhone it comes all the tabs on it is

46
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,890
now an official Twitter for iPhone app

47
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,280
and the the fire up the first we just
got the fire under new phone

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,170
gonna it's gonna happen and it pops up
this product here to do taking disable

49
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,290
what you want to do as a configures the
default option

50
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,870
and and the other one is cancelled so
clearly the the typical person

51
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,209
who trust your creative dialogue boxes
as fast as possible just click Configure

52
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,190
NSSA do you want to do this and yes go
away stop asking me on a tweet about my

53
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,550
mail

54
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,300
and so that's gonna be the typical case
right but that's not the only case rate

55
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,840
I mean

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,930
its other other people like their

57
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,220
I'm sure there are a lot of gadget
hollick sinister right now great I'm

58
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,790
and I think somebody asked for showing
smartphone hands earlier

59
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,540
there are a lot of right so it's so even
if you're aware that there are

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,400
indications these decisions are made
here if you consciously making them

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,629
it might not be for the right reasons
and I i divisive interviews as I was

62
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,340
talking with people about you taking

63
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,470
and this is kind of a typical example by
people starred

64
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,680
I started to get into got the

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,510
the iPhone 3G heard about whether signed
up when I

66
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,299
got forms of mistreatment assault ride
out say a

67
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,170
might as well try it that's the heir to
the train of thought that that's as hard

68
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,209
as people think about shooting for the
stories

69
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,819
typically and so does he understand
efficiencies a

70
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,049
a tech podcasters I'm sure he has some
sense of what's going on

71
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,580
but does everybody who makes this blue
shiny decision note

72
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,620
I'm so a brief time line have do takes
on Twitter

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,230
originators that you put in a location
field said it when everyone is just tax

74
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,319
my location was tryna other people but
in a city or country Year's Day

75
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,549
and eventually client started updating
this with GPS

76
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,090
chords as less I started getting agents
may be worth looking at

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,120
and I thought I was gonna have to scrape
Twitter & extract this field and figures

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,400
who was actually updating and one is
getting updated

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,230
but likely for me later on in 2009 they
admitted at each tweet

80
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,400
that you can embed to be escorted is
that made it much

81
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,298
much easier for me for this project
because I could just get them the tweets

82
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,289
and Polya

83
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,300
the metadata rated I and originally
there is no way to ask her just for

84
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,419
GaTech trees you got all the tweets no
matter what you had to discard them

85
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,560
feel to them on your own and eventually
the API's got richer and

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,979
I stop having get gigs data for the
occasional tweet super

87
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:37,159
ISO so this is on blackberries what
happens when you enable

88
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,970
when you try to setup for Twitter which
is kind eyes for geotagging

89
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,360
you see that it has a bunch of options
it gives you some choices as to how much

90
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
you wanna share an actor you want to be

91
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,639
so frances I picked the second one not
the cell tower but the assisted GPS

92
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,690
setting and here's a his geotech treated
at a concert

93
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,040
answer the question is where where the
Mike phone reported me as being in that

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,820
red dot

95
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,659
in the corners were actually CNC them
about three streets of

96
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,090
so that's that's pretty an actor great
and that may be reassuring somebody but

97
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,190
as we find out it's not actually that
reassuring

98
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,479
because one tweet sure is inaccurate but
many tweets

99
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,550
Aster Data accuracy as this is worth
between looks like from the API

100
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,669
you can see is just got the GPS data
rate in there

101
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:27,190
and it sees super easy to use Twitter
gives you everything you need

102
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,520
so wise is a big deal grant like who
cares iight

103
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,719
photo myself eating ice cream do you
take that posted at work but doesn't

104
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,460
matter who cares recognized

105
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,820
right but nobody great but there are
reasons to care I don't know can anyone

106
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,500
speculate as to why this may be a big
deal

107
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,949
and you should excite can't see anything
right stockings gonna

108
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:52,580
the man RF robbery at yes exactly so
they're always good reasons

109
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,609
exactly that would be brutal are

110
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,550
so arm and if this came up in my
interviews again

111
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,030
and so the same the same podcasters
talking to before

112
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,039
had a head has a little anecdote you
gave me that with that he did

113
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,440
right on the head exactly what you guys
have been saying and exactly what

114
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,210
worried me when I first heard this one
of the guys that I know

115
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,229
he's a freshman from from Henry's we do

116
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,289
so the work together for a beer stuff as
he treated me

117
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:23,389
a few weeks ago saying bluntly are
looking to your tweets and by the

118
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:27,180
you know but we did see I think you live
in this area Mississauga

119
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,410
which for me it's not a problem I I'm
pretty open with what I'm doing but I

120
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,050
can see that becoming a a

121
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,990
an issue with some people there might
not be aware that they're showing that

122
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,270
sorta data

123
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,500
so somebody saying there is basically
the ones you take is just an anecdote

124
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,080
it's a it's

125
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,280
one load tidbit but many do takes put
together become

126
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,100
data you can look at the menu to make
inferences I'll

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,039
and so this this is one are obviously
want to find a way to get to illustrate

128
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,650
this to people

129
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,120
where this is kinda nebulous concept to
grasp is kinda abstract you thinking

130
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,729
well maybe people can do something with
my tweets be you not really sure

131
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,219
light and I i'm talking about Twitter
specific that's what I looked at this is

132
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,030
true either do taking services

133
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,250
I as well rate so how

134
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,250
a try to figure how I could expressed
this to people and

135
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,970
most people are visual are a lot of
people think visually and the tends to

136
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,330
make

137
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,030
a big impact on people so I decided to
start collecting geotagged tweets

138
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,099
and do some houses on them and then
visualize that put it on the screen so

139
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,849
people can see it was a scary

140
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,940
my go ultimately is to keep people there
in to make the think what they're doing

141
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,419
I SIA and and on top of that great

142
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,560
people are already doing stats this is
the same reason we

143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,250
like for full disclosure great people
are doing this

144
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,590
and they're not telling anybody but that
doesn't mean it's not happening

145
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,349
so my goal is to be the person who tells
people this is going shine some light on

146
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,569
it

147
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,099
and I want people to to realize making
that choice long-term consequences

148
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:54,219
confronted and make a conscious the and
maybe they'll choose to share

149
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,970
and if they do that's up to them but at
least the be fully informed

150
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,270
soon an early experiment this is

151
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,068
was an early prototype I I was just
looking at

152
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,160
act grabbing trees and finding them on
to get a sense for what's going on

153
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,490
and this person asking features creepy
and I think the answer is yes

154
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,800
I absolutely think it's creepy feature
us at this point I was describing from

155
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,099
water caused garden hose which they have
a streaming API seeking just

156
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,719
connect to it and now the fire some
percentage between your way

157
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,139
and those fighting about 1 percent 33
geotagged espy's

158
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,599
months ago or something and it's gone
way up since then but like I said

159
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,559
earlier is getting

160
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,779
gigs bandwidth just for megs tweets it
was unsustainable

161
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,939
I salutes the first up is to build on
that

162
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,300
and use filtering so they added own
ability to filter based on occasions

163
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,010
so that's what I did edge test for
geotagged tweets in certain locations

164
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,890
ask for three cities in particular

165
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,459
tryna which is where I am I New York and
San Francisco

166
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:56,070
so I've been collecting do take trees
from those locations

167
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,490
for maybe six months now I and

168
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,519
except one when the process crashes and
I'm not around to restart it

169
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,920
I have pretty much the entire sample for
that period in the city's

170
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,209
an answer to one tweet a second his
witches getting

171
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,240
I which doesn't sound like a lot but
over over the course

172
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,500
that this has been running at about 350
gigs tweets

173
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,180
I so here's an example

174
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,010
I've just one user that I I was going to
its from that i'm gonna keep coming back

175
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,839
to a bit

176
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,850
as their the demo just grabbing the user
during a tweet on a map

177
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,519
and when they did was they just ask the
database is accused who's tweeting

178
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,019
electric work crews

179
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,560
whose what are the top 10 users and then
I went through them and work up a box

180
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
which was kinda interesting like a fire
service is talking about the fires were

181
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,100
which is continued but then this guy
came up he makes a perfect example you

182
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,070
can see

183
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,480
radon screening out a couple of clusters
just by looking at it right

184
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,589
I this three clusters that are pretty
obvious and now a different amount

185
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,760
tweets you can judge how much time the
person spending each at these locations

186
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,420
and then if you look at the text what
they're saying so the text I it that are

187
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,810
highly

188
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,390
here this guy's just finish work see you
have a sense that the street is probably

189
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,350
at work in the parking lot and there's
some other tweets that

190
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,620
cropper that story so this is kinda
kinda scary to look at if somebody was

191
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,570
like here's a map where you live for you
doc

192
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,240
that's weird but I think really I think
I we can do a little better

193
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,300
technology so I thought I would teach
computer to do this now sits on its own

194
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,459
I'm so I spent a while trying to learn
about clustering algorithms and it turns

195
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,130
out it's complicated field

196
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,709
and is an np-hard problem and their
various heuristics I spend your days

197
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,490
reading Wikipedia

198
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,079
Wikipedia is not coding this it's just
not so when I started my friends

199
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,890
this demo tomorrow and I'm not done
clustering and S&P

200
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,240
hired and we are going to use news I
just come over

201
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,950
and and get this done so I went to his
place and we just act with that name

202
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,200
and my body is came up with this
solution right here

203
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,880
which is again I said is an np-hard
problems the briefer solution

204
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,300
I but it works which is all matters

205
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,360
I so again is not efficient but it gets
the job done

206
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,850
and it will be a lotta classes which one
tweet according to sawyer them but I

207
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,360
just ignore them because they're an
interesting

208
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,839
see can see the results here so it's
pretty successful

209
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,269
a bunch of custer's been highlighted the
big one in the middle there

210
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,140
and is not perfect you can see there's
some overlap in on some

211
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,569
bugs to Sordo but for the most part

212
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,120
for the most part it works and works
well enough

213
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,110
so the next step I thought is thanks we
have these clusters and that's carrying

214
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,290
like yours we spend most of your time
automatically

215
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,699
but what how can we make this evening
even creepier feel even more

216
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,250
visceral so they're like wow I really
think about what I'm doing

217
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,029
and the next step then is to
automatically classified locations

218
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,720
I so began to put up a QP is documents

219
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,639
document classification and read about
filtering improbable models and

220
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,709
guys as I cannot forget this I just
pulled up

221
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,720
something big clusters that I knew as I
could tell by inspection where somebody

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,040
was a

223
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,519
and I just for kids so you can see the

224
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,399
these are some example somebody was at
home with the dog law so that maybe

225
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:06,949
people

226
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,269
on it would but the dog owner people to
do but sleep in bed

227
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,480
that's the sort of thing that people do
when they're being awake at night

228
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,740
and and there are other types of
locations that you can identify pick you

229
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,930
were to rate so

230
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,839
at so-and-so sex I mean that it doesn't
get easier than gray

231
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,350
I am and watching TV right nobody
watches TV at work too much to be a

232
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,100
unless its break-up yes so I saw what
I'm doing now

233
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,370
is I can I did when I pull up you wanna
tell users report

234
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,769
we just I have all the cluster data
available i scan through each cluster

235
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:43,839
look for look for these keywords that
man identified and managed to sign a

236
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,839
skirt each cluster

237
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,069
and one cluster tends to win I

238
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:52,459
so if you look at the tweets added in
this cluster where there are hundreds of

239
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:52,999
tweets

240
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:57,170
it's quite clearly where this person
lives and if you zoom and you can

241
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,550
get it completed pretty accurately and
you could reverse geocode that if you

242
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,429
wanted I'm not

243
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:05,420
despite accessory Michael but it's
pretty scary right

244
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,829
and so this person is unconsciously not
like hey come to my

245
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,779
you know I'm hey it's great and take
pictures in the house is something that

246
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:12,309
just

247
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,689
treating the casual mundane things that
are going on in their life

248
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:18,929
and based on that it's enough to you
extrapolate

249
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:23,029
did the type location and I haven't done
it but

250
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,749
you this could be easily extended as I
should you to work place isn't it

251
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:29,199
friends houses and

252
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,360
trust people ca anything but I thought
this is an example to try now

253
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,110
and not most people fat most people here
are gonna be from traps that may be

254
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,410
kinda

255
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,249
free sovereign New York skin New York so
I got here Thursday night

256
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,899
set up in a coffee shop and just let map
and I have a map in real time so I just

257
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,019
like like tweets

258
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,259
for a and this is about an hour's worth
tweet

259
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,959
you can see that it's

260
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,009
it's pretty busy here in New York but
two people tweeting what's going on I am

261
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:04,620
and sorted as I just kinda just clicked
at them as i i'd get a username and goes

262
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,230
person that's a good night with a light
and a check at the Twitter page

263
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,339
maybe the maybe they didn't and then I
was asked that I just did a database

264
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,519
query again use

265
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,850
aggregated everybody's streets as a coup
are the most prolific New York tweeters

266
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,759
energy to take and so one example came
up and I thought I just run with it

267
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,459
ISO liked him this example on Thursday
II

268
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,809
in still over time so this is this
person's Twitter tag

269
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,870
her Twitter page you can see a bunch
tweets there

270
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,059
and with interesting I find about this
example is that

271
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:38,339
on this Twitter pages process thousands
of tweets none of these tweets here do

272
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:38,899
you detect

273
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,009
I so only a small fraction

274
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,360
this person is treated you take not not
a significant number at all

275
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,809
and that's still enough that we can
extrapolate I love details about them

276
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:55,480
so I ran into the system large plotted
and you can kinda visually see

277
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,620
if you don't see that this is a
particularly popular cluster

278
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,920
the system works

279
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,639
and areas I automatically and I decided
inspect the tweets Isaac

280
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,620
what application is this just by hand
and I know if you can read their

281
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,059
obvious as wide awake at an hour when I
was ever why to sleep

282
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:17,449
so that's this guys in bed can sleep
history

283
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,819
ISO again that this emissions evidence

284
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:24,819
the automatic classification fail rate
is now the home icon

285
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:29,490
I so that that's an illustration that
there is room to improve the algorithm

286
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,100
and maybe I missed some key words me it
actually tried to take a summer house

287
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,049
farm that was wrong so

288
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:38,980
slightest chance means is never treated
you and saw another thing I did

289
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,220
I was sitting on Friday afternoon
between talks I thought I'd

290
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,179
I'd I try to make it more interesting so
I add keywords for and I Sturgis

291
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:50,139
searched for the next time I and look
for people who were tweeting

292
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:54,240
about next 20 and won the game at those
my favorite was this one

293
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,600
Ben Jackson told me why shouldn't we
this picture that was a talk by Geo

294
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,339
tags:

295
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,720
in pictures and learning too much about
people I

296
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,039
so but then I thought that access the
database as a Realtor these new hope

297
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,069
her next hope up tweeters Havlat

298
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:15,410
tweets that are in New York San
Francisco track and i cant

299
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,660
one Michael and if you're in the room
have but I'd love to talk to you after

300
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,339
I so also here to some trees can in the

301
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,459
Hotel Penn area and a so if I send out a
bit though

302
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,039
I the retreat all over in the new york
city greater area

303
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,360
in particular I know that Michael likes
hanging out on the beach

304
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,329
and when I also know the system did it
did make a guess as to you

305
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:42,669
to try two classifies house and not
gonna show it

306
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:47,049
because he may be in but again if you
hear my God look Chelsea after as if I'm

307
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:47,630
right

308
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:53,179
and if not see if I can improve it

309
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,350
so there is %uh I mean that the system
it works really well right like

310
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,419
like shirt exec case where it nailed it
near the spot on again if you zoom in

311
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,279
you can get right into the Crescent rate
to the

312
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,369
to the house itself I and and and that's
a beauty if

313
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:11,639
data right like I said one one do you
tag is just an anecdote many your data

314
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:15,370
and use that it even at the heirs
because if your GPS there's somewhat

315
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,220
consistent

316
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,299
in truly random the center all those
tweets

317
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,349
is is the actual true center over time
rights even if you're up by five hundred

318
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:28,178
meters if you tweet a thousand times
that's enough to really complain it down

319
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:31,870
and see it it like keep in mind I'm just
some guy right like

320
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,510
I've been trying to do classes have been
working thesis and been going to

321
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,190
concerts apparently

322
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,250
and like to try to find time to work on
this as my project

323
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,250
and it works pretty reasonably and so

324
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,289
look at somebody with resources derail
its

325
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:50,850
paying multiple programs paying people
to classify what different types

326
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,350
locations are work people with untold
budgets do

327
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,240
no accountability and and it goes
further than that

328
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,570
II did this on date in the people chose
to make up great

329
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,289
I mean nobody forced them to you posted
you take tweets other the dialogues

330
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:08,960
encouraged

331
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,010
to you I but other organizations have
way more data

332
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,970
so if you just thinking about Twitter if
you treat vs UMass

333
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,789
your cell phone company knows where that
came from I can take them location

334
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:26,039
the NSA knows where that came from
takers your location

335
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,220
because it goes past 33 soco's I mean

336
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,720
but if you text message somebody I don't
have access to that and i cant do sir

337
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,139
houses with it but there's no reason the
NSA we know them

338
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:39,750
wiretaps in our everywhere every it's
just a fact

339
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,919
and there's nothing stopping them from
day and they know your location so

340
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,679
there's nothing stopping them from
building a similar database

341
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,740
with all these other disparate pieces of
information they have

342
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,510
and having that much more data to do you
to do the analysis with

343
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,250
and does kinda terrifying

344
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,090
and it but but again what's the big deal
like you where where you live is public

345
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,760
knowledge your problem most of us are
probably in the phone book

346
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,370
I and their credit reports on arson is
all sorts of information

347
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,850
so wise is a big deal couple reasons

348
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,070
first I mean again like I said when you
as you post more and more it stops being

349
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,870
trivial facts

350
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,159
stars being something that you can work
with and analyze

351
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,379
and never has not just you know this is
where you live

352
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:26,129
also what you do while you're it's who
you're with because maybe you take your

353
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,190
friend is watching the show

354
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,740
with you maybe maybe you don't take your
friend but they're tweeting at the same

355
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,510
time too and they have a cluster tweets
at your house

356
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,139
now we know that this connection

357
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:41,210
maybe you went to a hacker con and you
tweeted from there

358
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,750
and their overlapping treats with other
people now is certainly your own lists

359
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,200
right

360
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,590
I mean who knows what's happening this
and it's not it's not

361
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,908
a family right so a conversation takes
we have

362
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,629
if we could have a conversation is done
and maybe a person forget we talk to

363
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,139
bear

364
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:01,700
are maybe they remember they don't tell
anybody but every tweet

365
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,780
and and this is true in particular for
Twitter but likely for other

366
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,510
other date on the Internet basically in
this river at this point

367
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,139
I mean with is a fact that Google's
archiving all of Twitter

368
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,240
I it's one of the project the Library of
Congress's archiving

369
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,859
all of Twitter I'm archiving all it is
to take 33

370
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:24,270
like it's it's it's not just big
organizations easy

371
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,059
and serving organizations are certainly
doing it

372
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,460
and another thing that's interesting is
funny where somebody lives like it's not

373
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,049
interesting if you know some his full
name to fine with it that's pretty easy

374
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:38,990
but whether we don't know the real man
sorry necessarily somebody posting

375
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,419
thinking they're anonymous but you
taking is giving away

376
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,490
their location based on the location you
can find out the real name

377
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,889
finer things but the real-life and

378
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:51,960
that scary

379
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,149
so music do you really example

380
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,549
sir to the bigger picture why this is a
problem rather than just that you know

381
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,080
where this guy lives three

382
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,559
so we found his house how we could

383
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,100
reverse geocoding get an address hi if
you really wanted to you

384
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,280
and guess what he was with his brother

385
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,359
I some surveillance I

386
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,299
so now we have this connection right
it's not just him that we have

387
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,609
information on

388
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:23,139
also his brother anybody goes further

389
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:29,139
because he tweets about his brother like
his brother

390
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:35,070
you really don't like we know his
brother breaks the law

391
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,359
so if the police had a headache for
drug-drug bus for the month

392
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,658
that they need to do they now have
somebody to find great

393
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,609
and it goes further than that to rate
cuz even if the police don't care about

394
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:47,119
this and hopefully they don't

395
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,330
maybe maybe maybe his brother in 20
years two sides

396
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,199
to run for government

397
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,470
and again this isn't really a big deal
but when you're running for office the

398
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,480
smallest thing can burn you rate

399
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,510
and so an enterprising journalists can
look through the archives Twitter could

400
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,408
look for tweets at this location

401
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:08,059
and BAM has some or maybe is not a
journalist maybe is the other political

402
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:08,668
party

403
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,909
great as I can sorry is a pothead would
you want a pothead

404
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:16,149
did making your children's decisions or
something like that graydon just think

405
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:17,030
about the children

406
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,500
there you're a there's a smear campaign
right there

407
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,690
I am so that's what worries me its its

408
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,720
is when you put it all together also

409
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,559
so what more do I wanna do I am
technically I i

410
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,649
when you get more Tweets for an honest
look at three cities I'd love to do it

411
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:33,970
for

412
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,240
word the world or or have users that
aren't in the cities of these be able to

413
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,590
say give me my data

414
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,850
just retreated Isaac honestly and I
means any better storage Kors

415
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,409
like I said is there lot of tweets I'm
on shared hosting

416
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:51,490
to get very upset if they keep this up I
am

417
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,799
in like to improve the clustering I
showed you that they're sometimes

418
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,549
overlaps

419
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:59,619
issues like that better clustering we
could do better houses

420
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,799
and I'd like to do better classification
like I said I should be three examples

421
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,700
one right now

422
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,799
got a great one are angry knowing I
gotta wrong

423
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,240
and one where musher again Michael
contact

424
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,340
after I am so I want to use better

425
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,790
a better model pics basically one you
spam filter

426
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,000
spam filters can tell within a
reasonable there

427
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,629
if message spam based on not too much
information

428
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:26,419
and I think it ran something to do the
same for these different types and

429
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,799
locations

430
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,750
and sometime best analysis right us this
is a map when I tend to tweet

431
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,320
I so typically noon to the afternoons
you may get a sense that I'm a late

432
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,490
riser

433
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,220
that I sleep night so that our
connection you know when I'm asleep

434
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,030
from public so much reading when I'm
asleep and so the server now says he can

435
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,830
factor into locations to

436
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,629
and interest give more data is every
Thursday at three something like

437
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:56,139
hey I'm at the park playing frisbee you
know where I go every Thursday

438
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:00,419
and and if you're after brought me which
somebody suggest was a possibility

439
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,609
them and you know I'm not a hand or that
I'm probably not

440
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,158
and finally I want to do that now
scissors time where you look for

441
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,809
overlapping clean

442
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,000
clusters from different users see can
try to make inferences about who knows

443
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,720
who

444
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,260
and angled further and I'd like to go
public with this

445
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,158
I mean again the whole point is to draw
attention to put this in people's faces

446
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,799
make them raise awareness

447
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,830
and at least have people bill to make an
informed choice whether they want to

448
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,730
choose to share GA tix

449
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,720
tweets are not some kinda trying to
decide what I wanna do with a renowned

450
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,070
I'd love to get your thoughts on this
afterwards

451
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,189
I weather just at the microphone are
after the session

452
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,500
over a beer just had was the best way to
present it is

453
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,869
originally I was going through all the
data out there and that you look up

454
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:41,909
every user

455
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,010
that was a scary but then I got to
thinking I mean this is all public data

456
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,590
none if it is Lego is also people chose
to share

457
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,740
I've been keeping it from Twitter
following terms and services nothing

458
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,559
unethical but the collection data but
I'm worried there's maybe something

459
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,299
unethical about

460
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,809
sharing all the conclusions with
everybody despite the fact that they

461
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:01,740
could generate the same

462
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,179
for themselves some kind of torn between
wanna do back

463
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:11,700
so like I said I was gonna creep you out
with was possible to do it your tags:

464
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,419
and if you'd like to see a live again I
it's running and I can

465
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,190
contact me after we go somewhere else
where battery on my computer so much

466
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,659
and we'll look at it I'm so but I wanted
to share some good news to

467
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,770
anchors because people are choosing to
geotech great like

468
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,830
nobody's forcing them to you what are
they getting into what are we getting

469
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,820
I am so here's here's an example this
isn't you taking the situa- cation data

470
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,090
that you choosing to share

471
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,679
if you bring up Google Maps does Google
where you are faster

472
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,820
and aggregates and you can tell you how
long it's going to get to work

473
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,869
that's awesome right I mean that's like
Wikipedia you there

474
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:50,049
channeling people's idle time and
something awesome and for the public

475
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,379
benefit

476
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:55,520
and that's great great thanks who
doesn't want to get to work on time

477
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,869
and another example came up recently in
china there's a g20 summit

478
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:03,369
II tryna and I don't know how much
pressure got sidetracked but inside

479
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,740
China is a huge deal

480
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,710
I am expect time and money over billion
dollars on security

481
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,090
biggest arrests mass arrests and Katie
history as far as I know

482
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,639
thousand people arrested I new
surveillance cameras installed

483
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:21,049
rights cop cars on fire tear gas all
that all that jazz the comes like the

484
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,580
g20 summit

485
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,658
and was interesting was trying to follow
it and learn I was going on

486
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:28,800
Twitter was one of the best ways to do
it and

487
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,780
you two examples have Twitter was a
powerful tool would you tags

488
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:37,309
during the g20 so the first of all ok
allied such matters Flickr

489
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:41,428
but day at like a mention in Solomon's
new surveillance cameras

490
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,880
and try for the g20 and the promises
they be temporary

491
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,040
yeah exactly exactly so

492
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,809
wanna a professor at the University Tron
and your comment was

493
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:56,600
skeptical as I'm sure everyone is but
decided to do something about it so he

494
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,920
grabbed me by the new

495
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,590
a phone could you take photos got got
the list

496
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,780
where they're installing temporary
cameras and walked in took pictures

497
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,809
and the post them publicly on Flickr
video takes

498
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,910
so by doing this it means that after the
summit anybody who's interested also

499
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,760
skeptical could just wander around

500
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,129
go to the dot on the map look for
whatever the pictures I've

501
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,140
to head the camera still where the
camera is not there and that's a pretty

502
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,880
powerful use

503
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,920
using the surveillance tool to turns
around back great counter surveillance

504
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,330
and I'm as far as I know the last I
heard a half the cameras

505
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,960
gone which is surprisingly good news and
I'm not sure what's happening

506
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,929
the rest so another example where'd you
taking

507
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:40,870
was really helpful during the g20 summit
stir two perspectives

508
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,090
the events I and watching them

509
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,690
was was quite interesting there's the
mainstream media which really love this

510
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,160
picture

511
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,440
really love pictures like this mean
that's an awesome there some with

512
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,309
protester

513
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,730
protesters jumping on the cars in that
burning cars make really good TV it

514
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,250
answer

515
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,230
I am but that's not the full story and

516
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,270
some bio by following the the hashtag on
Twitter by looking at

517
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,480
do take tweet on Twitter as they popped
up you got is our pictures coming in

518
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,809
that had different perspective he said

519
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,040
videos got commentary I am

520
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,790
so for example he risks

521
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,690
ok this is one uses worth tweets during
the energy 28

522
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,330
clustered I so you can see the kinda
wonder drugs downtown Toronto where the

523
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,659
g20 was just west of it and you can see
that there's a

524
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,690
yellow cluster me to use that there's
more tweets there than the them

525
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,570
Louis green ones and so you can see that
there's one kind of off to the side

526
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,020
and you might wonder why did this person
to be so much from the spot

527
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,929
Queens but I'm security Google that or
search for it on Twitter

528
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:50,850
very first had the you get would be this
by yeah

529
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:57,039
yeah

530
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,660
I

531
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:07,660
yeah

532
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,190
so that's a different story than the Big
Pictures painting I mean the big picture

533
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,220
makes it look like there's a riot going
on in the cops are struggling to

534
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,160
maintain order

535
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,020
whereas the the video those you
generated posted to Twitter

536
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,780
makes it seem more like three people
just hangin out singing the national

537
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,190
anthem

538
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,020
we were getting assaulted by police and
thats very different stories in fact

539
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,330
rate and it's a perspective

540
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,020
that for some reason the mainstream
media wasn't really picking up on it

541
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,629
first

542
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,470
I but as time went on and people are
tweeting been talking about it

543
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,400
were first to a little more hustlers
annisten case if

544
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,730
not only getting both perspectives but a
the certain ground-up Twitter

545
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,380
perspective

546
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,480
having an effect on Mission coverage and
so one final

547
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,920
good example and give you is exploration
I showed you heard you take for on

548
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,560
Flickr

549
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,840
and has been used for counter surrounds

550
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,360
but there's another use and this is
somebody a interviewed said that when

551
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,380
they go somewhere new

552
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,570
they never been before like Papa map
place

553
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,080
and like to you look at the pictures
that and having seen the pictures place

554
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,360
makes them feel more comfortable and
safe actually go there us I think that's

555
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,620
a pretty compelling

556
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,810
good benefit assuming it's not a false
sense of security occurs

557
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,860
but I so maybe you're going to New York
for the first time going to khane

558
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,840
and you're wondering what essayist shows
and see you look around

559
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,880
map anti-government hooked up and looks
like to have good views

560
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,050
see can even pull that up and you may
rethink your decision

561
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:50,470
no it does not have good views I am

562
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,860
so to put it all together than I just
went over a couple benefits did you

563
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,440
taking

564
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,160
I am and I give you some scary as
earlier about what

565
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,330
do taking at the large could result in

566
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,050
for an individual person so for me and
the point

567
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,180
a project and I'm trying to make is that
to Bo informed choice

568
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,540
I people have in need to connect to rate
people want to participate in public

569
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,490
there's no there's no reason we ought to
be in this room together

570
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,210
we could just be watching the stream
online other people like to be known

571
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,480
people like to meet people people like
to connect even

572
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,120
even over the Internet even in reality
some people use Yelp I've heard a story

573
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,260
about people sitting

574
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,080
to different people sitting in a coffee
shop to check in on Foursquare and based

575
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,740
on both checking in the same location

576
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,980
decided to check like those people were
in the same

577
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,220
they could see each other but it wasn't
until they use technology to mediate

578
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,510
in break the ice today started chatting
and that I mean seems a little strange

579
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,710
but that's good right I mean ultimately
we want to connect its good

580
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,890
people do so it's kinda is this

581
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,570
this is balancer trade-off and it's
really hard to quantify

582
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:02,070
the long-term risk sharing too much
information it's really hard to get a

583
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,840
good sense

584
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,750
for and my hope by doing this by

585
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,880
taking people's tweets clustering them
class fineman showing them

586
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,630
hey guess why is is that people at least

587
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:18,790
get a better sense balancing making that
decision arm

588
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,790
but even informed choices and

589
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,470
isn't perfect and this came up in an
interview I did and this person

590
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,900
is a very technical person I is a social
media person

591
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,270
and this is what they said when asked
them about why they were shooting

592
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,030
to its to

593
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,590
until you mention it's just that I i
totally forgot that my tweets for being

594
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,540
just had his

595
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:48,540
well so so really liked she went on to
say that when he first got the phone

596
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,389
and as always when people first get the
phones asks and the medicine to share

597
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,730
but totally forgot so tweeting garland
with not even I'm considering that they

598
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,210
might be giving out personal information

599
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,990
situation from like that's a problem I
think that

600
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,480
the word people giving was information
be and some

601
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,630
what can we do I mean I think improving
the app sabia separate all the

602
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,960
was the abs as once and then never tell
you again so these

603
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,300
periodically showing you what's going on
would would make you

604
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,890
think about great in which at least
trigger that memory that oh yeah

605
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,840
yeah I did decide to do tech nineties
because unless you look for it I guess

606
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,560
you just don't know

607
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,409
Ann Arbor something I'd like to see i'd
like to see an improvement in the

608
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,000
absence

609
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,920
reminders for people and have people
look at what they're doing and think

610
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,730
about it I get the feeling that is
actually gonna get worse before it gets

611
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,210
better

612
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,880
another you guys

613
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,110
but Facebook I did that I think they're
gonna be big problems

614
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,540
Facebook turns on geo-tagging which
looks like is pending

615
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,820
concerns back in May on average wanted
to do it

616
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,899
I am and their numbers reasons for small
most people's Facebook account a tight

617
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,170
fit real identity

618
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,740
ASO nobody even has to try to figure who
is this person in reality it's just

619
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,120
there

620
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,819
face but never delete anything day never
took received anything if you delete a

621
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,000
photo on Facebook exactly did

622
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,649
just check like desert is a buoy and
enhances deleted

623
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:22,239
that's what happens when you delete a
photo on Facebook and

624
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,540
even even cue track clickstream whose
photos you're looking at the whose wall

625
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,989
use you're looking at

626
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,950
this don't lead anything answered now
they're gonna have cheered it on top of

627
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:32,830
that

628
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,270
and they know you really friends graph
already so they can but now the Canon

629
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,060
for people who use may be deliberately
didn't tell Facebook

630
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,149
now based on hate being

631
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,429
treating injured acting just asking the
same location

632
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,270
and it goes worsen access facebook like
as an immigration and if you think

633
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,168
Facebook is an ethical company

634
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:57,460
right great exactly so I'll give you an
example a blast that

635
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,910
I am there's a Blackberry app for fiscal
today's

636
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,640
and you can optionally allow it to you
sync your contacts on your blackberry

637
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,830
with Facebook's are automatically
download the photos

638
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,620
people on for dinner but see you think
it would connect to Facebook

639
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,690
get your list a facebook friends and
sink that on the phone

640
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,140
you'd be wrong but actually does it
takes all the contacts on your

641
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,170
BlackBerry

642
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,910
upload them to Facebook and Facebook
comes back as early as persons on

643
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,680
facebook to but we're going to remember
the rest

644
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,230
are there they say that maybe they say
that the night keeping it all but they

645
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,470
may be right so even if you deliberately
didn't

646
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,710
friend somebody on Facebook you have the
contact on yourself

647
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,980
now Facebook knows that and in that
they've been up front about that

648
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,170
and that's the problem Facebook is that
they're not friend Jenna

649
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,650
rate I mean every time the change the
privacy settings they don't ask for

650
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,430
permission

651
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,040
they don't then I say hey guess what
this change is coming i click here to

652
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,990
turn it on

653
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,840
there's like a by the way alt our status
is on a public I you can turn it off

654
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,180
configured said and ants

655
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,350
who would be surprised if that's what
they do you know the next iPhone for

656
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:03,730
the next version the iPhone app is just
earned you take on by default

657
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,580
and then you can make an informed choice
because most people aren't even aware

658
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,690
that it's happening

659
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,850
so I'm not the only person to worry
about the service use I'm

660
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,150
some other ones that are interesting I

661
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,290
his army TACOM think everybody's
probably seen to kinda did the rounds

662
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,680
while back to

663
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,720
taking your Foursquare chechans and
telling people where your

664
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,030
not which is at home I am your open book
is interesting cuz

665
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,480
again like as if it's becoming status is
public necessarily informing people well

666
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,140
are these people didn't get in fact
about it as a people are opting just as

667
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,259
a buddy the status

668
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,610
DUI conviction stock its terrified I can
stock you was presented yesterday

669
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,270
it's awesome is doing the same with i'd
just do you take photos that you post

670
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,610
has again iPhones tend to you once you
add location data

671
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,350
to you photos and you can for a lot of
people

672
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,759
are you can do the same thing I've been
doing but with just with the photos

673
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,650
I am and yes so so

674
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:05,030
to summarize man I mean I think the key
point is that

675
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,100
like I mentioned earlier one tweet is
harmless want you take is mostly

676
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,220
harmless

677
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,860
but once once you start generating
amounts of data the people to start

678
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,120
making inferences and you need to beware

679
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,049
people need to be aware but it's not all
bad news

680
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,670
I am society reap the benefits from G
attacks

681
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:29,170
I both sometimes the users get a benefit
I had a interview one guy said

682
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,630
ask him what value could ever gone from
Foursquare

683
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,810
and one of his stories was there she

684
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,210
woke up one morning hungover and look
through where he checked in from last

685
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,280
night was a caring I went to the bar
that's awesome

686
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,680
and so so there's a personal archive
value right there any

687
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,129
told a married man and that's that's
kind of cool maybe

688
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,800
maybe not great cool eniac

689
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,690
and so my final point than wanna leave
you with his two years ago the last hope

690
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,730
I want to talk on wiki scanner by
progressive

691
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,230
and he was talking about how others all
this data on the net

692
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,810
I he looked at wikipedia: I've been
looking at Twitter

693
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,590
I and their ton/tons other sources the
data can be aggregated in the house is

694
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,470
Ron

695
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,800
and is my hope that that the people in
this room in two years we'll be doing a

696
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,560
presentation

697
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,049
about some interesting data set they've
mind from the internet

698
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,400
and prosthetics conclusions for me to
see so

699
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,730
thanks any questions

700
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:36,730
lights

701
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,060
I think there's a microphone

702
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,560
battery one thing I would mention is
that the ladies first the iPhone

703
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,840
software does show

704
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,130
an arrow in the upper right hand corner
whenever

705
00:38:54,130 --> 00:39:01,130
GPS is feeding did now

706
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,330
a.m. I don't know if you study this at
all but arm Basu your house

707
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,100
on now a lot of people are sending out
feat Google on searches along with the

708
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,910
real Google searches a scramble that

709
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,350
ABC anyone doing that which you location
same one day there in turkey one day

710
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:14,890
then you're

711
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,310
but clearly every day by their tweets
their home just to scramble stuff like

712
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,100
what you doing

713
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,390
I haven't seen neck in the data set
actually won the slides I took a

714
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,009
I'll I was gonna say step 1:

715
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,800
makes it scares people but you're taking
step to question mark step three profit

716
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,350
and then step two is going to make an
app that lets people live over there

717
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,380
on selling so I'm sure that will start
to see people selling

718
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,930
Twitter absolutely you just pick a
location on a map is tweeting from

719
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,859
picture help people carried alibis if
nothing else

720
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:53,120
and the questions

721
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,279
it'll be I like I said I'm happy to chat
after or

722
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,210
des moines after I am for beer

723
