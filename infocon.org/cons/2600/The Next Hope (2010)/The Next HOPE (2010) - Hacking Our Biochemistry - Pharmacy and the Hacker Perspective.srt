1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,009
be some love you may be wondering what
this guy is

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:11,009
someone re-ask fact this is a master

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,720
hacker it's a cold virus a common

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,220
cold virus and recent so common

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,299
is that the hacks are ni immune system
we have

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,390
two main aspects to our immune system

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,470
the adaptive which is specific to

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,120
particular viruses parasites

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,959
and that's what antibodies are and
that's how vaccines work they stimulate

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,230
production antibodies and then there's
our innate immune system

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,739
which is our basic

12
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:52,090
are it's our bodies you know best
security practices

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,840
our bodies firewalls that sorta thing
our skin

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,190
are feel mucus

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,480
two years stomach acid

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,810
everything that generally protects us
from

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,610
Jan happened so in our nose

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,810
we have cells hair-like projections
called cilia

19
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,250
they're always bringing stuff

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,409
down into her throat and into our sonic
where the acid

21
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,650
kill stuff this guy hitches a ride

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,220
on those Celia down

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,658
%uh but he doesn't go Angeles Tomic once
he gets the back on the throne

24
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,189
he latches onto receptor call the

25
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,180
intercellular adhesion molecule and this
receptor

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,390
is there %uh sorta like an open port

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,860
firewall you need some on so that you
can actually communicate with other

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,610
computers

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,509
%ah and our souls need to communicate
with each other

30
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,219
this receptor is used for army skills to
be able to

31
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:03,700
attach when our cells are infected need
help but the sky

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,289
just only takes advantage that and uses
it as a entry

33
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,959
and chill cells and back some up
versions

34
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,270
rhino virus will upregulate now

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,099
construct the cell to make more those
receptors work

36
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,760
attach and so viruses

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,870
in general they can't reproduce by
themselves they need to bar

38
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,020
borrow are cellular machinery

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,690
and nay other genetic code there

40
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,129
are an air DNA and

41
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,319
follows guy when he gets in he turns

42
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,450
the sound to a little virus making
factory

43
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,220
eventually sell ruptures and spreads
these things

44
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,879
all-round makes more of course
eventually

45
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,840
we start feeling symptoms coughing
sneezing

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,440
snot and and

47
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,739
these simple research has shown

48
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,459
that the symptoms don't help us get
better faster

49
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,569
from these guys we have to wait for

50
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,040
antibodies to be made in their nature of
although

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,090
this is an are in a virus so

52
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,480
mutates pretty readily which is why we
can get colds

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,810
over and over again even though we made
antibodies

54
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:30,220
but coincidentally

55
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,519
the symptoms really help out the virus

56
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,690
because in just a couple drops

57
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,930
me guess there could be a million these
things

58
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,530
and basically

59
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,819
and you're not sick enough to stay home

60
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,129
and where we can spread it around radio

61
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:54,970
just love it 60 we go out %uh and

62
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,739
me oh we get stop on our hands me touch
things

63
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,730
and this can survive for several hours

64
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,640
on a surface weighty someone to come
along and

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,670
touch it and then touch their nose and

66
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:18,670
naked and start the whole process over
so

67
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,580
the news he's is our sealy into getting

68
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,099
are receptors to effector cells are
cells to make

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,630
more and then are symptoms an hour to

70
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,909
spread so we don't only then act

71
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,130
finest common holes so

72
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,870
my name's Jennifer I'm a pharmacy
student

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,500
I am before going into pharmacy %ah

74
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,690
I got a degree and electronically Dr
Singh communications

75
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,800
it's basically a computer art degree hi

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,860
I did some programming and some well web
development

77
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,610
mom and then I became interested in
pharmacy

78
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,389
hustling and I talk a little bit about
the pharmacy profession

79
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,440
before I can see the actual biochemistry
hacking

80
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,190
com probably I love you have this image

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,690
%uh a pharmacist you know the counting
pills

82
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,130
I know I did begins %uh

83
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,900
is why thing still up there yeah

84
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,639
I can see anymore for some reasons %uh

85
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,680
so counting pills

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,530
and I am actually an instructor sign who
tosses

87
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,470
you know pharmacists are students or
whenever not tailored

88
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,580
any you know any media whatever's

89
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,719
taking pictures of Haas to let them

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,810
take pictures of us County kills me is

91
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,880
on no matter how many hours of footage
or how many pictures they take

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,340
it's the counting pills an engine bay
use

93
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,069
I am farmer says go to school or at
least six years

94
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,250
two years underground for years
professional school

95
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,319
%ah so obviously it's a lot more than

96
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,310
counting bills on I think gonna

97
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,350
I think pharmacy hands

98
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,590
requires women to hacking perspective
pharmacists are the

99
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,740
experts on the drugs much sir hundreds
now

100
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,190
on and on treatment courses of treatment

101
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,780
experts on how not just how drugs work

102
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,009
how they work together how they work and
different patients

103
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,340
why they would be different and
different cations

104
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,419
on even things like quality-of-life
issues

105
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:52,030
of figuring out on know how to get
someone better without

106
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,410
having really bad side effects %ah even
practical things like

107
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,740
how to deal with missing doses hustlers
some

108
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,930
medication management involved com

109
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,440
which has a problem solving perspective

110
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,569
may also work in many settings action
mention might not just retail

111
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,160
on in the hospital nurse psychiatric
nurse

112
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,180
poison control on some people of

113
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,220
talking with patience some people hate
talking with patients

114
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,810
work weird hours and work with
radioactive materials

115
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,150
%uh and they're called nuclear
pharmacist

116
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,630
I just use this to show the wide variety

117
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,710
upsetting some pharmacists can be in

118
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,449
and I also want to get

119
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,310
and two question up like why doesn't
seem to take so long to count pills

120
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,539
pharmacy and there like a Mac in 20
minutes

121
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,628
and you just 10 perscription it seems
really simple

122
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:02,009
com is a slight advancing

123
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:07,590
and speaking sir ASO

124
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,690
yet mainly it's your on numbers

125
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,819
of places process hundreds of
prescriptions a day

126
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,000
and I was a match in if you were at a
fast food place

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,180
and you for ordering a medium fries

128
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,729
face all 20 cars ahead of you %uh that
one

129
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,650
you'd expect a long wait even though
it's fast food and it's pretty simple

130
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,719
people have you might have for
complicated

131
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,890
orders I am another thing that goes on
in pharmacy is set

132
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,260
all prescriptions and stuff are checked
by the pharmacist before they go out

133
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,360
and sometimes there's only one actual
pharmacist on duty

134
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,130
om the technicians do most fulfilling
I'm

135
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,160
mail but imagine if you had to wait and
a fast food place in everything and to

136
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,120
check be checked

137
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,170
double checked by the manager om

138
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,880
and would be desirable fast food is a
word really slow things down

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,459
but pharmacy it's very important to get
it right

140
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,440
%ah at the pharmacist as also

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,500
often interrupted a lot %ah

142
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,480
yeah a lot of phone calls com to doctors

143
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,769
on doctors and nurses often consult with
pharmacists

144
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,850
%ah you know finding out what's best

145
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,680
%ah now insurance companies even know
the expertise is not

146
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,140
insurance hustlers lot that goes on it
gets pretty fancy

147
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,339
I but now I want to get into some actual

148
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:43,339
chemistry

149
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,660
yes ari

150
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,260
%uh sometimes like if you go to a drug
store in New

151
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,399
get your call prescription

152
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,690
I mean you're savon over the counter
stuff you might look at the ingredients

153
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,740
and see

154
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,110
you know soon enough and bring HCl
excellent orphan HBR

155
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,260
not in the name of the drug followed by
some

156
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,410
%ah the Oso DMRC trader

157
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,529
HCl I am man

158
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,350
yess I still wonder up men from the
title of this line

159
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,370
%ah else this a has to do with
solubility

160
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,440
ha solubilities important I am

161
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,730
be cuz and affects how the drug is
absorbed

162
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,200
how it's distributed how excreted on

163
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,220
and this is something we can manipulate

164
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,170
Anna with chemistry

165
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,189
so on some basic chemistry

166
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,070
and just sound assume you have any

167
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,390
a background chemistries all mainly
about magnets

168
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,860
and you have

169
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,300
an I have to check slide

170
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,260
yeah alright I like you know you've
protons and electrons

171
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,950
I protons are the enemy nucleus in their
positive charge

172
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,380
and electrons are and negatively charged

173
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,189
com with the I'm

174
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:26,160
carbon and there's I am more

175
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,969
well a carbon Essex protons and as six
electrons so it's

176
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,640
neutral om to loans electrons are happy
impaired

177
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,720
and there's a nucleus and underscore on
the

178
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,769
outer level %ah and their unpaired

179
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,269
and they're not all that happy all by
themselves out there

180
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,339
with oxygen other six Anders to you
they're paired

181
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,670
and happy fathers to their unpaired

182
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,180
and you can imagine a if they get
together and they can share

183
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,529
%uh make a pair of electrons as long as
they share them

184
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,829
and these electrons are on the valence

185
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:07,110
Science College Cole Vaillant bonds

186
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,730
and in chemistry when you see online
like on the bottom

187
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,510
%ah what the methane it represents a
pair of electrons

188
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,329
on the top I have a pair is actually
drawn a stock's

189
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,760
but usually there on as lines

190
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,850
I'm and that's what the bond

191
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,950
his how in the case of

192
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,730
on water over to the right om

193
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,529
it's all different than carbon as to Bon
Scott and it has those two lone pairs of

194
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:39,149
electrons out there

195
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:44,180
which affect its magnetism oMG magnetism
also was affected

196
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,700
%ah by the oxygen itself being bigger
and attracts the electrons

197
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,070
more closely to it then %ah the to the
hydrogens

198
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,360
sometimes electrons are closer to the
oxygen there's more

199
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,040
a negative charge close in the auction
and there's a little bit of a positive

200
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,990
charge

201
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,380
on your the higher share which makes
this

202
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,620
polar there's a difference in charge in
on the methane

203
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,350
the electrons are more like in between
the carbon and hydrogen so it's not

204
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,540
color

205
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,639
are some things that are they have this
clarity will tend to dissolve in water

206
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,760
com me another picture water I

207
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,730
where's things are nonpolar like and
methane

208
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,920
oil and stuff or not mix with water

209
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,139
and now only dissolving nonpolar
solvents

210
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,430
but we campaigned to be a late at

211
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,600
with some acid if and bass

212
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,250
assets basically are are molecules like
and donate a proton

213
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,339
%ah which is the same as a hydrogen
without an electron

214
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,889
Ascot it's positively charged com

215
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,070
and bases can except in a

216
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,790
accept a proton om

217
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,099
and if you imagine I'm sup Leviev

218
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,149
HCl on that slide I'm

219
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,440
and on you know NaOH

220
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,570
sodium hydroxide the HCL's a strong acid

221
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,570
hun dissolved in water filled associate

222
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,920
the chlorine while hang on to those
electrons

223
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,350
and it's all happy and now

224
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,470
stable nice hi and the hydrogen

225
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,790
on is on

226
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,099
promiscuous and well go metaxas on
January electrons can find

227
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,350
om and the case to the base again like

228
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,240
the hydroxide also DM is happy

229
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,899
hydroxide is ready to be reactive and

230
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,410
and grab onto any I hydrogens

231
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,639
com sound

232
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,260
those are strong acids and bases I here
we have a couple week

233
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,319
weaker lines on the case of ammonia

234
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,860
nitrogen because I has at lone pair
electrons

235
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,019
got a little bit of a negative charge
sticking out there

236
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,589
animal except a proton

237
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,810
I love the thing on the bottom has a/c
take acid

238
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,570
ants and vinegar com and

239
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,320
it will give up an electron donor that
proton it's alright

240
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,060
om and something to notice here is that

241
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,230
on the left but the ammonia the ammonia
is

242
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,560
basic it can except truck a proton

243
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,769
I'm but on the right its acidic concerts

244
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:49,170
conjugate acid form eg has an extra
proton that it could get away

245
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,070
on an existing equilibrium I could go
back and forth depending

246
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,120
if there's a whole excess of protons ill
keep the proton

247
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,480
om will stay and its acid foreman acidic
media

248
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,829
com but if you put it more basic media

249
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,880
and all kinda revert to a more basic
form

250
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,910
and this can be important because the

251
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,219
acidic conjugated is charged

252
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,079
com and the non acidic one is not and
the same with the seda acid

253
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:24,130
%ah on the left it's an ass inform
rocket on base form in the face

254
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,389
form is charged now companies molecules
are

255
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,910
up pretty polar Nilesh their soluble in
water

256
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,680
%uh you know whether charged run charged

257
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,089
%ah but the next time a is

258
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:43,690
I much more nonpolar doesn't necessarily

259
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,740
Anna 10 dissolve in water unless it is
charged

260
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,740
com hand

261
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,839
suspect all but up by hacker vision here

262
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,329
and a hacker Allah give you look in a
URL

263
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:09,039
and you're trying to manipulate a
website with the database

264
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,429
%ah one of the first things you know
your eyes

265
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,799
might just see him to neck wary line
wary where you could put in a seat for

266
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,629
injection

267
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,449
arrest us are really matter and what the
pages are named or anything

268
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:26,620
on you know you just go straight to the
vulnerable point and the same is true in

269
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,510
chemistry

270
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,049
%ah especially organic chemistry com

271
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,780
those nitrogenous are places record

272
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,770
accept a proton and as we know that can
be used to manipulate

273
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,940
charge which can manipulate

274
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,940
solubility I'm some somebody may be
wondering what

275
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,620
this is it's not mana potion

276
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,620
I

277
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,940
nearly 100 drink it would not taste very
good

278
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,159
and saw a two layers a vinegar and
turpentine

279
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,840
and a mix about as well as oil and water
the niggas polar

280
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,030
hi and the turf in time is nonpolar

281
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,928
used as a painter com and in the vinegar
layer on the bottom

282
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,059
I have I have some yellow food coloring

283
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,408
and I have some blue dye from

284
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,710
a Sharpie pen and the blue dyes a
molecule looks much like

285
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,780
up the one on the screen com

286
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,480
and right now it's dissolved in the
vinegar

287
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,000
because it's an acidic media its charged
OMF

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,530
here

289
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,168
I have some soda ash I'm see how I can
do this without making

290
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:54,570
too much of a mess soda ash is much like
baking soda

291
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,820
up stuff hmm

292
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,820
favor

293
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:12,600
ash for that in some fashion very from

294
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,889
if af

295
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:22,269
from said

296
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,909
handed a few

297
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:30,370
here I'm

298
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,590
yeah it's

299
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,009
a not sure exactly

300
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:42,870
I it's a little bit more basic than
baking soda

301
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,960
they have to look it up

302
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:54,960
I'll out remember these structures are
times sonya

303
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,009
oh yes I think so dashes sodium
carbonate where

304
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,419
yeah here where's baking soda here

305
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:09,220
asylum baking soda sodium bicarbonate

306
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,169
yeah I am so anyway the

307
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,340
if is up %uh cuz the

308
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,889
soda ash is basic and

309
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:25,139
in neutralized all the vinegar and also
affected the dye

310
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,179
I am we still have some in the bottom
here

311
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,500
dissolved in the vinegar but most little
blue lamb

312
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,480
up into the turpentine where %ah

313
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,950
that's because it changed as big as the
the base

314
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,529
ball the Anna proton

315
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:46,879
of up the dye and it became a

316
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,379
and nonpolar %ah so

317
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:53,500
when stopping soluble nigger and went to
the

318
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,370
on turpentine hands

319
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,360
how've

320
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,539
action all DAII used and Sharpie pens is
a trade secret

321
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:14,350
on however on 5 serving this you can't
tell her I can tell that %uh

322
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,320
has certain properties om obviously has
a

323
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,240
%uh an acid-base nature seller it can be

324
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
om video can be charged are not charged

325
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,649
ours online on the right of is

326
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:33,009
permanently charged Scott for bonds on
the

327
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:36,269
%uh nitrogen it's not acidic not basic

328
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,480
its solubility cannot be manipulated

329
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,389
so we know that the dye is something
like the one on the left

330
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:50,389
not like someone on right yeah

331
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:57,669
I spent some time %uh exploring are
trying to find some different guys I

332
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:58,509
could use

333
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:01,570
and this was them most accessible on
networked

334
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:08,570
yahoo.com won t saying yes sir

335
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,269
so people know he's mentioning azo dyes
I'm

336
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:17,619
archer depart on chemical structure com

337
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:21,389
my also be interesting to explore com

338
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:24,769
so undue

339
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:30,330
more like less chemistry chemistry and
more hacking our own biochemistry

340
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,860
%ah having pain killers work I've been
asked this question a few times

341
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,519
have and yeah it was pretty obvious with

342
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,059
an anesthetic that tolling numbs like a
course you don't feel anything so of

343
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,639
course you don't feel pain

344
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:49,070
oMG miles like you know I profane
aspirin naproxen

345
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,869
aerial like if he spent the day helping
your friend move

346
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:56,909
may really sore the next day com then

347
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,639
new new can take a Ivor profane or what
not and

348
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:04,460
and I'll feel better no more pain up
someone comes man punches you in the

349
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,700
face ill stop your

350
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,190
he'll still feel it no matter how much I
profane you to

351
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,299
%uh ass because they're

352
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:17,279
I are different kinds of pain nerves com

353
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,679
they've got %uh one ones like this that
have

354
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,799
a those yellow cells on them

355
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,539
back once lined okay good

356
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,710
thanks om those cells %ah

357
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,619
speed up transmissions all those are
very fast these early the idea punched

358
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,470
in the face you feel it %ah

359
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,750
nerves on there also nerves that

360
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,990
are much slower and

361
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,580
and they respond to chemicals called

362
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,689
prostate glands om prostate gland in ZAR

363
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,169
synthesized on-site in response to
injury

364
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,619
om are pretty important for a %ah

365
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:04,129
for repair %ah they dilate blood vessels

366
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:09,279
com which shall apply get senate brinks
nutrients and stopped and what you need

367
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,460
to repair

368
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,480
com it it heats up the area would speed
up chemical reactions to help you heal

369
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,570
faster

370
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,830
they can be used to give me %uh
immobilizing

371
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,299
uses a scaffolding to on you know

372
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:27,200
prepare the site for healing and also
causes pain

373
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,619
%ah and week we don't like pain very
much

374
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:34,230
on the brain tells us that where hurt
and

375
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,460
%uh always a yeah reno I'm just gonna
take

376
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,059
the ibuprofen of so

377
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:45,269
across the planets are pretty
short-lived

378
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:48,960
I am and they decay quickly so other

379
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,279
just synthesized when we need them and
are synthesized by a

380
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,809
a chemical called RM enzyme I'm sorry

381
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,678
on help cyclooxygenase so I can imagine

382
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,980
every inhibit cycle oxygenase keep it
from doing its job

383
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,109
%uh we'd stop feeling the pain

384
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:12,809
an hour two kinds oMG cox-1 and cox-2

385
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:16,009
%ah hey ok ox1 is that good

386
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,809
type which its protective for the GI
tract

387
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,809
om and it's not associated with pain
cox-2 makes prostate gland and

388
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,049
that are painful to us

389
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:33,690
and most Lisa an over-the-counter pain
medications like aspirin and ibuprofen

390
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,919
are a they inhibit both of these us I
stop the pain

391
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,080
up a classically have a problem where on

392
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,149
they her are us to make have used for a
long time and

393
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:48,169
can even induce ulcers I am

394
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:51,899
or even their prescription ones too
others are really potent

395
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:55,710
one reason hospital sometimes called
Carol ac

396
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,279
and and its really potent

397
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,759
just as potent as morphine chilling pain
but

398
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,570
I can only be used for a short time
because it so bad

399
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,418
%ah for the GI tract if you use it for
very long

400
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:14,950
Obama as a few years ago %uh some people
came up with the brand I

401
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,009
enough I know of almost only inhibit

402
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,200
the bad one and usually this is

403
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,389
usually selectivity and drug is a good
thing

404
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:28,409
cuz left your side effects on

405
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:32,730
usually and om and is more targeted to
only on

406
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,440
do on fortunately are biochemistry

407
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,240
and a long way since like all code out
of you had the pleasure of working on

408
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,990
old gone before

409
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,609
%ah you know stuff that has been French

410
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:49,869
stuff that's bring on top of other stuff
that's

411
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:53,049
not necessarily related heard attached
on are

412
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,168
as clues is an ego and tried to a

413
00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:01,559
change something and it change is
something that seemingly unrelated

414
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,809
om and so these %uh

415
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:09,369
cox-2 inhibitors came out IOC's Bextra
celebrex

416
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:12,759
on two of them have been withdrawn from
them from the market

417
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,259
especially by ox because they caused

418
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,830
heart problems I am

419
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,799
and I remember wondering of and a speedy
happened

420
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,509
%ah nearby oxygen and it does last then

421
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,210
I for pro friend doesn't I X is bad for
your heart ibuprofen isn't

422
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,519
also I look into this and actually
because of

423
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,019
%ah this we figured out that ever for a
friend can actually be bad for your

424
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:41,899
heart

425
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,980
on now I'm not talking about a one-timer

426
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,619
like you got a headache or yours or
whatever om

427
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:51,679
mio taking it up

428
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,649
this is what happens actors this becomes
a problem with daily use

429
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:59,570
Eyed Peas patients with arthritis and
things like that they're taking it

430
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,889
all the time om ibuprofen

431
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,799
/url there's a spectrum of how selective

432
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,730
these all are and I prefer opens kind of
in the middle

433
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,230
om that's not the worst %uh am IOC's was
the worst

434
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,139
om and the best are approx and an
aspirin

435
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:22,419
/url Lee selective I am and

436
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,549
aspirin is cardioprotective om

437
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:30,000
but they're the worst prayers comic I

438
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,520
and the mechanisms I clearly understand
but it seems that both cox-1 and cox-2

439
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,760
affect the blood vessels and %uh

440
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,849
cox-1 and and churches clogging

441
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm and cox-2 balances that out sophy
take out of the cox-2

442
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,809
without taking out the Cox on om

443
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:53,020
then NHA funny Mr %ah

444
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,168
Bo's strokes and heart attacks in other
problems like that

445
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:01,559
I'm so I was an interesting lesson about
side effects

446
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,609
%ah going on I'm not gonna talk about
tylenol

447
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:10,970
I much just got its own unique mechanism
which is not fully understood

448
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,309
I am I did want to mention OPI its

449
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:18,889
I am opioids don't work on me

450
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:23,230
they own and have it information they
work on the central nervous system

451
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,289
which is your spinal cord in your brain

452
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:31,240
and as because the body the body has lot
mechanisms to do

453
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,740
different things I'm Monday needs to I
obviously

454
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,889
can make us feel pain a can also

455
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:41,559
%uh modulate pain and the I'll be lights

456
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,099
work on that system to to modulate pain

457
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:51,158
com they've also got some central
nervous system side effects for side

458
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:53,080
effects like euphoria

459
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,408
om nausea respiratory depression

460
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:59,549
I'll which people on get tolerant to do
so

461
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,940
it's not again these limiting mom

462
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,750
but it's not too bad %uh may also
inhibit cough

463
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,960
com and they've also got some peripheral
affects

464
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,700
%ah and constipation is banking on com

465
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,379
people don't get %ah large show the
constipation unfortunately in XP

466
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:25,039
%ah release limiting

467
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,169
Yeguete tolerance to %uh near

468
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:31,500
pain relief %ah hero2

469
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,019
a lovely del centro a fax I am and my
love for for all tracks but not

470
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,549
constipation

471
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:41,649
%uh but 100 known to

472
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:45,839
another thing about side effects
sometimes they're not

473
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,589
always bad I am I'm sure Eve

474
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:54,029
I policy num odiaum I'll a pair mind

475
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:57,230
it's also an opiate it works on the same
OPI

476
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,750
receptors as morphine and the others

477
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,389
have I and a sitter for

478
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:08,639
Tyree acres like it has the same
constipated effect

479
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:12,619
thing is on it's kept out of the central
nervous system

480
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:16,500
so only answer for for all affects I

481
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,369
as kept out by on Hurley because it
doesn't cross

482
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:24,309
love it does I cross the blood-brain
barrier our

483
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:29,230
are and blood vessels like go to our
central nervous system

484
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,309
are %uh the most selective of

485
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,649
but they lead and it sorta like some
things on your computer

486
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:40,730
yuan only health administrators are
super users to be able to access

487
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,940
and it sorta similar I when our bodies

488
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,099
I am we also have another defense

489
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:50,649
com and that's a

490
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:54,519
p-glycoprotein as an enzyme that mall

491
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,720
comp stuff out %ah Sony repair my
tickets and

492
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,260
I will be pumped out by this %uh
p-glycoprotein

493
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,369
com clothing is like another thing

494
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,960
el-amin pharmacists have to watch out
for

495
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,710
%ah interactions om

496
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,970
there are a lot of peak like a protein
inhibitors

497
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,269
om there's one called clementine

498
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:24,250
and and it's been observed that if
someone is on

499
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:29,609
when eighteen they can I experience
central a fax from a paranoid

500
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:33,549
such as respiratory depression om

501
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,889
Solar's an interaction there that we
have to be careful with

502
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:41,309
%uh a farce probably %uh the next

503
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:45,519
PO thing you might wonder is this
possible to get high off of ammonium if

504
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,099
you are taking money these

505
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:52,389
pgp inhibitors %ah it seems that I tried
to find out who else

506
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,839
through research %uh

507
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:01,070
not personal research there's no water
for snow research out there right there

508
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,149
are few who have posted to the Internet

509
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,320
ninety basically said doesn't scratch

510
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,869
but

511
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:18,519
its

512
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:24,289
hi he says yeah I have shot if you
injected directly and

513
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:27,700
because one I it gets on their

514
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,700
I'm yeah I mean sir

515
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:37,429
%uh you it would be easier to socially
engineer someone to give you just

516
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:44,429
have yeah um

517
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:54,329
its

518
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:57,408
this tram at all

519
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:01,859
I yes travels a synthetic

520
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:06,299
painkiller that is unique it's %uh a
pseudo all be i'd

521
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:10,750
it worse heartland of Vienna receptors
and it also works on a

522
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,049
neuro transmitters serotonin are
pan-african

523
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:17,909
and it's kinda weird but it tries to
balance out

524
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:23,599
I me now only affects

525
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,599
yeah I can sum up the same side effects
I am

526
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,139
yale has hardstyle pair might have I
have found out that

527
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:37,339
%ah it and is it does others not just
threw up beyond receptors that helps

528
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:38,918
with the diarrhea

529
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:42,578
I'm so I take a that's not at home at

530
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:47,399
%uh you not as potent went for sure opin
FX's

531
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,560
like you know that and a interestingly
to

532
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,029
I has a metabolite that %uh we suspect
might be

533
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:59,170
/url toxic to the brain com

534
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,529
this nevers a problem I with the

535
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:06,440
with actual of regular you serve it
because it doesn't get in there

536
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,750
com and we don't really know for sure
because %uh

537
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,310
we don't have any funnies like injected
themselves on

538
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:18,000
on fun is interesting to note

539
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,060
com coupler drugs with

540
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,240
interesting side effects I minoxidil of

541
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,040
there was developed as a Ave so die
later

542
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,329
%uh dilate blood vessels and help with
blood pressure

543
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:36,069
I'll put it aside annoying side effect
of

544
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:39,119
extra hair growth on so now

545
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,150
%ah if you are I'll male watching any TV

546
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,040
in the early nineties if I saw a bunch
of commercials for rogaine

547
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,230
and then tell you what it is on those
commercials but it was

548
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,240
on if you were going bald and you want
to grow more hair

549
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,069
and that's minoxidil thats up but it's
highly marketed for now

550
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:03,950
%ah another on a silver saldana now

551
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:08,759
%ah also developed as a face a dilator
for blood pressure

552
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,950
%uh and and dilates blood vessels %uh
turns out it's all

553
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,330
%uh more selective %ah

554
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:22,080
then as better known as by actor of

555
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:28,420
so and same are half

556
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,589
and last section I

557
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,450
afghanis hacking mentality is hacking
perspective

558
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,759
%uh can help us with drug design mom

559
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:41,759
soul attack something %uh heartburn

560
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:45,850
as a condition you get on male paintball
on your chest

561
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,330
when some stomach acid gets up into your
throat

562
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,619
and he appeared occasionally can pop
some toms that neutralizes the acid

563
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,819
%ah or even take a a on all over counter

564
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:02,920
%uh Harper antihistamines com

565
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,140
that slows down the acid production in
your stomach

566
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,049
a little bit om but chronic heartburn

567
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:13,420
can need something more powerful and

568
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,970
%ah chronic heartburn to be caused by
reflux disease her Alzheimer's

569
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,839
and and it can be very damaging if it's
not treated

570
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,890
com so we want to treat it

571
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:32,359
%uh and the best way we know how right
now is to

572
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,430
on a slowdown acid production on the
stomach

573
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,690
%ah acid is produced in triangle cells
in the stomach

574
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:45,130
and I there are several pathways several
things that stimulate acid production

575
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,850
and coding a particular type of
histamine

576
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,310
receptors gets 2 million um

577
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,890
and help but that's only one partners

578
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,989
%ah there's gastrin acetylcholine

579
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:02,529
up so the stop all acid production we
have two target

580
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:06,900
proton com and this is a backdoor jobs
because

581
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
I it would be very difficult to get a
drug

582
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,700
into the stall make for the mucus I down
and to where the parietal cells are

583
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,009
and still have it like yellow be able to
bind to the proton pump enough

584
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:24,180
find anything else on the way om

585
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,210
so you have to you %uh act

586
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,980
come in through the back door and it can
be active until it gets there

587
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,040
weekends %uh we aren't doing anything on
the way the F do

588
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,509
I have a drug that goes through a
star-making turn the intestine gets

589
00:38:39,509 --> 00:38:41,400
absorbed into the bloodstream

590
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,880
%ah and then it somehow activated when
it gets from the prying all cells

591
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,339
%uh I believe we have a picture of all
members all here

592
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:56,210
this is a proton pump inhibitor and I
can again to

593
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,489
every nitty-gritty piece of chemistry
involved in this

594
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:04,029
a design that this molecule %ah by will
mention one of the key things

595
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:07,230
first key thing is low sulfur %ah

596
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,369
a proton pump is a protein and

597
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:15,040
a good way to target proteins wanna make
a stronger bond to it

598
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,989
and there's an amino acid called sis
team that has

599
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:25,200
also for and and it's %uh susceptible to
making

600
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,730
Kong Mainland on I saw applied to bonds

601
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,770
some by using solver defined we can find
irreversibly

602
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,239
I and really I have something poking to
knock out that

603
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,330
home om

604
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:44,098
and but the sulfur as it is right now

605
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,630
and saw yeah I molecules happy kinda
staying

606
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,150
the way it is on until getting a very
acidic environment

607
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,750
and where's their an acidic environment

608
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,460
on Apr I'll SL which is pumping acid
it's just %uh make

609
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,770
on so it's really kinda clever om the

610
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,609
the protons all %ah and

611
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:11,210
attached to the nitrogen in the lower
right

612
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,080
com and now that part of the molecule is
charged

613
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,940
and the nitrogen on the other side of
the Salt her get really excited

614
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,239
and a I am parks in the molecule

615
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:27,270
all tax itself and basically this
molecule rearranges myself

616
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,430
%ah and such a way that the solve ours
now

617
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:36,819
like its on very stable and this offer
is sticking out there ready to go

618
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:40,910
already defined and by this time it's
right where should be

619
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,410
and cell and in a bind the proton pump

620
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,259
and knock it out and it takes we r body

621
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:51,759
pretty much has to replace it %uh an r2d

622
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:55,119
start making I and Archie

623
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,130
make as much acid and that takes couple
weeks

624
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,690
om so takes a while for this to work I
am

625
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,670
they only knock out a very small
percentage the palm spy

626
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,880
they can have a very potent effect and
it can be

627
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,940
extremely helpful for people with on
harbored problems and really allow them

628
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
to heal

629
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,170
and if they have a all sir a

630
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:23,069
infection rage file or i Ave even on a
course of antibiotics

631
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:27,599
%uh in conjunction with these and to be
cured

632
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,700
I'll so only ever

633
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,220
packed for health care and I believe I'm
on the last slide your hand

634
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,250
com I'm gonna be

635
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,940
HiDef and the Morse room tomorrow do

636
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,839

I might I have much time tonight

637
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,330
%ah but that's the end of my
presentation and

638
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:57,330
a questions life

639
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:14,619
you're known tropics um

640
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:19,759
I earlier kinda like there is research
on them a few years ago and as far as I

641
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:20,650
know

642
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,460
the research religion turnout much that
was exciting I can go

643
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,720
om you know didn't turn out to be a
helpful

644
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,930
%uh for people's memory and stuff

645
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:36,080
%ah me i mean there are some %ah

646
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,500
you and supplements out there and stuff
to do so

647
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,040
do some things about most of them are
not really research get

648
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:51,040
hi and Osama and I'll keep asking your
pharmacist

649
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,400
Sonny Luna

650
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,020
fire doctor %uh suggesting taking every
program regularly to

651
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,340
ahh LP love you have a injury

652
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,160
that is can do free

653
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,200
feat that re-phrase from uses for some
kind of brew is often your bone

654
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,980
the type a bruise that would normally be
slow to heal

655
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,840
farm and they say take ibuprofen every
day and that for

656
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,010
helped lead I okay um

657
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,350
water %uh you know processes in

658
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,529
information is obviously a part of
healing %ah

659
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,170
but there are also cases work can be on
working in pede healing

660
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:08,850
on because it %uh your friends love
blood into the area

661
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,110
om but sometimes

662
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:17,320
on ass sometimes is counterproductive
it's too much orders too much

663
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
information

664
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,970
and it gets in the way of itself INR our
body does

665
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:26,010
the best job I can %ah your doctor

666
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:31,480
10 probably knows more about om exactly
which kinds of conditions would be

667
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,280
better to

668
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,050
keep the information down mom

669
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:43,050
so but it's not about hi I know huh so
this is more for comment but if you are

670
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,080
interested me know

671
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,330
neutral Big Spring hacking or improving
cognition come talk to me later

672
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:55,220
I will agree with you as far as arm what
you're saying with gingko biloba not

673
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,710
doing much by itself however there are
number compounds that

674
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,180
to improve memory specifically and once
they're more highly researched

675
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,640
glance might hydrobromide in which is
marketed under the name

676
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,109
RAM Intel is probably the best
commercial example but their number of

677
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,230
especially SEO calling donors that will
have

678
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:18,180
benefits arm I guess my question was
more

679
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,180
with the improvement that we see in
terms of technology in communication do

680
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:23,740
see

681
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,940
some these drugs becoming more
accessible to the lay audience being

682
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,500
able

683
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,890
to experiment with themselves that and
minus

684
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,520
arm and the Eagles won size
experimentation and you see that

685
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,170
affecting your business in the future
I'm not sure what you mean by the

686
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:44,380
I'll ask our the on

687
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:50,510
being mark says Paul I could you
rephrase that: basically

688
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:55,540
internet Eagles communication and means
that a it's no longer me trying fun

689
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,170
stuff

690
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,640
in a corner but now I can communicate
and go hey you know if I tried this

691
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,799
it ends up giving tax result to me how
does that work but you see that's or

692
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,300
uptrend were information being more
distributed to the masses

693
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,910
sort of reducing some the power that
pharmacists and doctors have over

694
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,690
the control of fun and interesting
companies I i mean is

695
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,780
it's a interesting thing I do think I am

696
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,450
be on the internet to spread information
I can ever very big effect

697
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,900
I don't like it at all om mio

698
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,260
and is a threat to the power pharmacists

699
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,090
om I think it's it's a real opportunity
for pharmacists actually

700
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,470
on as we evaluate there's more more

701
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:46,130
things out there and chaos far as I A

702
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,590
now like memory improvement and stuff I
like to

703
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,100
keep an open mind nurse not much
research on something yet %uh

704
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,820
you really don't know %uh I'll save that

705
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,760
com that there are a lot of trends out
there that may not have any merit

706
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,460
and and it can be difficult for someone
and her friend joe says all this lurch

707
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,410
you know and this is great and and like
he'll cut off the placebo

708
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,940
and there you may or may not be research
out there that %uh

709
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,990
shows how well does or doesn't work om
Anna

710
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:26,590
I mean overall I like the flow of
information and I think it can be very

711
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,780
empowering to patients om and now

712
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,750
probably change only health care is done
mom

713
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,000
file CNN I just see it is

714
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,400
empowering overall I'll

715
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,870
and and also make things more
complicated for pharmacists

716
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,540
on especially and every if someone comes
in

717
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,140
at the like hired by AL

718
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,089
taking megadoses of you know vitamin D
Eve I

719
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:00,040
no scandal not be wrinkled anymore %ah
things I have

720
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,700
%uh get no evidence what whatsoever for
them in

721
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,140
on and trying to explain to people now
that's

722
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,160
that's not what works for a hi

723
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,100
buttons I'm an overall I do find it
exciting at least

724
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,020
from this is not much my question is a
little adjusting a site and

725
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,120
sorta but high-end your frog you brought
up to cold virus

726
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,480
you brought up aspirin now I receive
aspirin may help you feel better

727
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,810
but it turns out to from study they
didn't Lancet among other places well

728
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,450
least

729
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:38,680
post in the Lancet they discovered
interesting left because it affects the

730
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,220
frosting when system it also affects
your immune system

731
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,660
and it turns out to defuse they took
volunteers

732
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,100
and they checked the live virus quite
deed by titration

733
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,490
in the nasal secretions people used
aspirin had a higher level love them and

734
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,280
they're with their

735
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,060
longer which means maybe you're feeling
a little better but you're actually have

736
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,620
you called

737
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,640
longer these finance but Allah me the
others

738
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,060
have an interesting point there you
think about it I can happen every day

739
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,299
%uh I don't know about that specific
case om I know I learned to be looked up

740
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,370
to

741
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,630
yeah yeah %uh the stinger force was
fever

742
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,000
if it's minor you may be better off not
really did your body functions better

743
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,370
immunity wise with a slight fever a
devil and Selma

744
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,430
%ah the own structures talk about why

745
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,560
you know you might not necessarily one
entry a low fever and is

746
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,009
%uh helpful for your body to clear out a
lot of infections

747
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,810
arm just for some online Notre bit of
choices sir

748
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,980
coffee have what are the questions that
I had

749
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,280
or circa and then on the connection
between

750
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,560
on from SeaTac firm see and

751
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,000
hacking is intellectual property law and

752
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,840
in this country at least you can on Sat
Mar kills you can't get back bonds are

753
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,900
active sites here

754
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:05,630
by home there are countries specifically
Indian Brazil that have allowed under

755
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:11,150
on health crisis exceptions for
countries to produce

756
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:14,810
medications that are otherwise calm you
covered by Patton

757
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,060
in the US and

758
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,870
signatory countries arm at generic
prices

759
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:25,049
so specifically HIV drugs arm from India

760
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:29,560
are being manufactured by you know
people who go to the same colleges

761
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,049
the same sort of industrial chemistry
and and biotech colleges

762
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,030
people make this same drugs here but
they're available much

763
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,270
much cheaper and wondered if that was

764
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,610
something I have read

765
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,980
yell about on I'm

766
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,180
international issues can with patents
and yet

767
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,310
complicated and in some cases II

768
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:57,180
you know and media save even ignored
drug patents

769
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,649
om and it's really hard to say what

770
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,880
a good solution is i mean

771
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,350
%uh Dr drug companies gonna go over
there

772
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,160
try to stop for a moment and they om

773
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,950
you know I'll our I know what's going to
happen with that exactly

774
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,910
%uh 0 on a a slight tangent

775
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:22,990
I did read I'm recently about

776
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,520
%ah some drug companies banding together
onto

777
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,870
research malaria %ah on the grounds that
say

778
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,140
%uh neglected on disease

779
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,460
mainly third world you know %uh problem

780
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:42,550
with audience that doesn't have a lot of
am income like we do have here

781
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,830
and so to reduce the cost of researching
it

782
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,340
the drug companies are going to develop
their own drugs and eventually but

783
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,350
they're going to share all our research

784
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,779
on in our to market to this %ah

785
00:51:54,780 --> 00:52:00,540
third world market which is very
interest

786
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,590
arm quick one a you're talking about

787
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,720
aspirin probably being the best
painkiller

788
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,410
arm just because a the less side effects
as wondering about

789
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,210
a settlement if any om if what how it
rates on that scale

790
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:18,280
and then also one other quick question
is

791
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,550
arm if you could have you heard about a
they did a study where they showed that

792
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,350
basically because arm these pain killer

793
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,870
%uh I think the NS adid category

794
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,190
yet the arm that brain circuitry

795
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:38,340
love so social rejection is shares the
pain circuitry

796
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,930
and so they did a study that showed om
social rejection like pain

797
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:47,300
you know that your feelings basically
being her could be lessened by that

798
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,510
but then there's been controversy around
that people saying that now there's

799
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,870
different areas in

800
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,779
so what are your thoughts on that if
you've heard about it or just from

801
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,150
hearing Medina

802
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,190
up sparse second part I am

803
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,480
I haven't heard that about the

804
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,380
non-starter no anti-inflammatory
specifically

805
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,690
com I have heard cases of chronic pain

806
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:15,420
%ah let's definitely can be connected
with emotional pain

807
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,630
%ah and knows but Lee clinical levels
oppression

808
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,560
com man there could be multiple reasons
for that it's obviously no fun to be in

809
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,110
pain chronically

810
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:29,540
%uh and the owner can be disability
involved

811
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,960
but there could also be something
biochemically involved

812
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,650
com as far as aspirin like I don't think
it's

813
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,700
male the best pain killer because that's
the worst

814
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,630
for your stomach com it just happens to
be

815
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,660
I the best for your heart Adam Jones

816
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,160
%ah now and saves

817
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,129
and Tom

818
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,820
as far as acetaminophen acetaminophen is
pretty good because

819
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,520
com because it doesn't on

820
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,390
yeah hurt your stomach are your heart or
anything

821
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:11,210
om it can hurt your liver you take a lot
of it

822
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:15,570
are few take %ah like a lot of people
get themselves into trouble because

823
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,970
play %ah will take all preparations that
they are no

824
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:22,940
has acetaminophen in it and then they
also take acetaminophen and I do this

825
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,050
for several days and it builds up

826
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,080
and and damages spare liver

827
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,620
com

828
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,009
right it also it does not %ah

829
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,230
bring down information networks are a
different mechanism

830
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:42,070
om yes over some things might not be as
effective

831
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,900
I now and if you have a problem with
