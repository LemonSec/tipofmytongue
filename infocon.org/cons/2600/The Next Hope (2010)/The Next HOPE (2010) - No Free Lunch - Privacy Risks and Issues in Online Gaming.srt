1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,189
okay so the war kept on growing role in

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,890
and then all the sudden one day they
gave up

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,980
they had as a child things no big
problem in a got

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,250
nice apiece for a while and then Sony
came along with what a little trick was

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,550
and most you probably know what happened
the Sony BMG a cop sexual scandal

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,529
they went ahead and I install the
rootkit under Windows systems only

7
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,930
naturally ever happen was it open the
back door that other people to get

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,170
because they actually happen the socket
echoed writing

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,670
and then I am but what it did for me

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,210
in my mind anyway was it brought up the
idea that

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,660
companies style now looking at
commercially installed

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,690
kits and that's going to be a problem

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,940
I said doc is a problem we're gonna have
issues here things are going to work out

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,550
for us

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,129
in the slightest and then hello

16
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:58,769
blizzard came along the world Warcraft

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,080
and the warning came out and people
think I figured out with the warden was

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,679
doing well

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,720
fact that award was even running and
then people say well gee this is

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,650
actually running

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,119
as a Wikia it is looking at what you're
running on your computer

22
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,170
I'm to the words Arbor looking for
cheating software

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,189
we don't want players have advanced over
other players

24
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,560
my question became what else is doing

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,180
again can we trust them had they

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,290
earned at level of trust and now
recently this came up in the past couple

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,159
weeks I may not the real I defy

28
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,240
I was aware that okay

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,670
when they announced a real ID it was
basically gonna say we're gonna make you

30
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,000
all posts under your real name is now

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,259
I was actually dead set against using
email accounts as you login names

32
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,909
and I didn't log on for about X number
of months

33
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,130
and then my children all wanna play I
have four kids in

34
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,229
all for them have characters on all the
work crafting the cashier to account

35
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,200
yeah we violate a less I know

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,530
waco's I am but what else is going on in
there

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,180
well the timing I thought was relatively
interesting with the Real ID

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,660
because they came out with the
announcement from my viewpoint

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,989
within a few weeks China saying
basically

40
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,099
their citizens can't post anywhere on
the internet

41
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:31,149
under anything besides their real name
so my mind this was in a move to bring

42
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,180
the community closer together and help
stop trolls

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,160
it was a move to keep untold numbers a
players in China Plain

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,940
and you know I have some more colorful
expresses what I thought

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,090
would was because it was doing but I
don't use them here

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,420
by fifteen-year-old is actually here I
think somewhere

47
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,910
they backed off the requirement it is
now

48
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,209
voluntary but so was the idea of signing
up

49
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,209
under the the email accounts it was
voluntary initial

50
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,680
involuntary initially then they change
made man sorry

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,730
again why bother

52
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,359
the Accord is a day thus I pulled up of
a fanatical there are currently 1.5

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,080
billion

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,650
unique estimated registered users online
games

55
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,670
worldwide worldwide 1.5 billion

56
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,930
thats kinda shit love people now

57
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,120
his emergency thing is I found out that

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,610
biplane somebody's gains she is a lot of
people who play at work

59
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,319
a lot of people who play at work

60
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,180
oddly enough they advertise the fact
they play at work

61
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,340
okay tell people in the game I'm playing
at work today

62
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,739
it's really odd watching I'm some
students

63
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,510
are the I S Department playing at work

64
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,829
and one another researcher want to get
them to help out

65
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,769
doing some work for them they were told
by the supervisor of the for some

66
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:03,810
playing at work

67
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,810
no no no they're way too busy so what it
comes down to really is om

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,080
and oh by the way we also found out they
were given of work by the Facebook post

69
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,190
on a regular basis

70
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,358
om I don't understand the young people
today

71
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,710
with my kids if I walk past one on the
computers we have a home night we have a

72
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,560
lot of computers at home

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,320
might 16-year-old daughter would go
ahead even if 14

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,000
wood window out right away for I am ng

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,729
that would help China height okay was a
problem in yet on Facebook

76
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,050
they're sharing everything almost to the
point that we're finding out what cult

77
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,130
or paper that is when they wipe their
ass after the pope

78
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,930
and I don't need that kind information
its way TMI I active a block

79
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,350
up this I teach another class so bottom
line is the game companies were the

80
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,090
about trust

81
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,120
so what are we doing well we started
trying to figure how can we look at this

82
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,350
on a regular way

83
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,669
well we pick three games we picked Evony

84
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,690
which all by the way advertises itself
in a very

85
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,410
some very unique ways mostly by
duplication other people's work

86
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,470
in they advertise in cells as play at
work without being seen

87
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,699
okay but yet they do maybe they make no
effort to hide the fact you're

88
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,560
connecting to them which I find fairly
interesting because I think I

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,289
any 16-year-old knows a firewall does
pick them up the heartbeat

90
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,849
I basically the three games were Evony
me out a pic dunn's and Dragons Online

91
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,660
in the third game was which I'll pick up
modern warfare 2

92
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,800
through Steam and I'm do. uses the
turbine engine

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,470
they found out they also use something
from panda software

94
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,500
and then the idea was on task one boy
actually read those terms of service

95
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,520
read the privacy policies that see what
they actually say

96
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,039
number two we actually monitored
installations with us offer a plan with

97
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,699
to see that when you install a game

98
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,930
you are installing a lot of crap on your
computer

99
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,930
okay and the third thing was stopped
using firewalls and then later on

100
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,030
Pakistan first what's the traffic

101
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,789
these are my pics team was I won't allow
steam on my computer at home

102
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,650
because when I look at the other
computer that had seen on them

103
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,520
steven is doing stuff when no ones on
the computer

104
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
okay so that kinda caught me right away

105
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,250
every man in the back when I first got
Windows 98 I came back from overseas

106
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,729
I am I the station overseas for a bit
came back from seized by the one is not

107
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,020
a computer

108
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,539
and all the sudden every few nights
every couple nights in

109
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,159
around midnight my computer would dial
up the modem

110
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,139
and that seem relatively odd to me and I
i Westside tracing a figure it out

111
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,430
and I'm 95 percent sure it was my mouse
the Microsoft mouse

112
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,349
was calling up every night now is in the
first release of Windows 98

113
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,539
anyway what we're trying to do is a
little academic rigor on this

114
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,030
I'm trying to teach her how to go be a
good grad student and get paid to go to

115
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,720
grad school

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,150
I think no grad students a PayPal for
college the really good

117
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,750
I i think reston should all be funded on
some way or another

118
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,599
so the emphasis yeah seriously

119
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,150
the evidence for me is on repeatability
experiments

120
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,710
can sunk into selling go ahead and take
I work in repeated

121
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,289
well down the row but I really like to
think Ive is again felt some kinda

122
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,240
realtor at Realty

123
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,800
real time monitoring games with some
kinda constant vigilance because saw for

124
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,889
updates a pushed you all the time
however I'm well over the fact that the

125
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:52,080
user has to make any kind effort to not
going to do it

126
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,128
it takes away the reason plan once you
take away a reasonable a game to have

127
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,319
farrakhan's effort

128
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,349
now no one's gonna do it but I'm more
concerned with ubiquitous computing

129
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,729
I we all have a little smartphones now
my son get upset yes they won that one

130
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,008
the people

131
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,560
I asked how many folks have smartphones
and ninety serves on the other room

132
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,620
raise their hands

133
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,750
and he doesn't miss my phone so I can a
girl be careful about how come is a

134
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,560
smart phone right now

135
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,430
and I am but there's an app for that

136
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,410
but again anytime my kids download an
app because is becomes a new toy so

137
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,400
mission yesterday

138
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,539
if you wanna trip drive in some way to a
swim meet a basketball game or something

139
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,870
the kids want my cell phone to go stop
playing games

140
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,229
but how do I know what s offer comes
from is definitely a very trusting

141
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,419
person

142
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,929
so the first one and you're probably
have some fun with this one

143
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,990
how many folks actually read privacy
policies

144
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,750
okay in listen you guys other
knowledgeable ones

145
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,760
alright I ask other people and everyone
I has a swim meet to talk to people

146
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
no one reads that crap how come

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,540
they're hard to read their written in
legalese

148
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,779
alright and I've never ever ever trusted
lawyers

149
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:12,420
because anyone who needs it own language
to describe their work they do

150
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,689
is probably untrustworthy I and I'm
retired military officer by the way

151
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,180
okay a retired back in 97 and Tom we
have our own language as well

152
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,600
alright I am

153
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,860
the average privacy policy calling to
see any study in 2008 was about 2500

154
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,700
words

155
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,380
and does the small documents I'm tight
turn to services driver agreement

156
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,630
everything else those kinda things are
even worse

157
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,760
we read them even my teenagers help up
I'll use a couple words on my for my

158
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,500
15-year-old actually used

159
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,720
at some point engine stuff here

160
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
account information is stored in process
United States are any other country in

161
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,040
which

162
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,860
in which the company or its affiliates
blah blah blah blah blah

163
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,610
so basically they're covering their ass

164
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,220
privacy policies really started off

165
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,170
as a mole removed by the government to
say if you don't legislate yourselves

166
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,370
and then in industry

167
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,329
we will legislate you the idea is to
protect the consumer

168
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:19,450
okay and you can go wikipedia. Privacy
Policy is a find all the information

169
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,800
about this kinda stuff

170
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,300
its it's a giant interest in seeing but
what happened was in my mind

171
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,420
primarily the job is the cover the ass
the company I

172
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,880
and you look down here I am I blocked
out event his name but

173
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,149
yells from Evony om

174
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,240
does anybody know what the ex what the
fought

175
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,589
source ebony is

176
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,950
yeah the old Wall the work that Chinese
gold farmers what's supposed to be

177
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,470
heavily and they went ahead in

178
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,220
and the rumored that the only spent
about ten thousand dollars developing it

179
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,100
but they got a crap load of money

180
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,170
if you buy coins from them to play the
game the free game

181
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,670
to buy coins from them a goes two ways a
company in Hong Kong

182
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,229
anyway nothing it's always interesting
to see in privacy policy we were generic

183
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,510
one pager

184
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,660
this five volume a change in time to
time so please check back periodically

185
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,939
bottom lines for the most part the
responsibility to check on the party

186
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,640
policy

187
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,630
is on you you have to go look at it

188
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,910
alright if they change it in you play
the game

189
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,180
you're still bound by it although I'm
really interested to see what happens

190
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,550
this has court

191
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,079
I'm curious how all these you Liz and 50
polly's

192
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:38,890
policies will survive court challenges
I'm not sure how i the might be legal

193
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,850
that is all talk to lawyers asked them
because lawyers

194
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,779
had a scare me I

195
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,689
his other sing one your web browser
client software may transmit certain

196
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,230
geographic information for miss got your
computer

197
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,290
blah blah blah blah blah because often
there I

198
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,870
information regarding billing your
account in a connection the

199
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,589
product/service tonic appear upload the
server

200
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:07,459
susser privacy policies nice to look at
the generic terms of service

201
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,450
the Euless the subscriber agreement the
various things you agree to

202
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,639
turbine actually had three of them they
have a Terms of Service

203
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,410
neur both the lanes I describe their

204
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,810
in its written in very high tech
legalese

205
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,680
Evan eases 10 pages long I steam has 12
pages

206
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,170
now an Evony

207
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,170
it was pretty much a complete duplicate
up another game

208
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,260
as a complete duplicate up another game
of which they are rumored to have been a

209
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,769
primary source of

210
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,970
out official currency on so I don't
wanna name the name had accused them of

211
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,589
doing bad things but

212
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:57,000
if you read I am World of Warcraft

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,839
and Yuri te Vinny's missus as a about
three weeks ago

214
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,269
I going to bed by verified it om they
are

215
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,450
word-for-word identical

216
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,620
including some in the lines I put here
because

217
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,139
Evony doesn't do this stuff

218
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:19,180
okay so this is their caps when running
the game a monsignor computers random

219
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,310
access memory in a sea view process from
unauthorized third-party programs

220
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,649
running early with Evony

221
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:28,860
there a web browser game only it turns
out we found out they really don't

222
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,200
install anything on the system is
actually chill

223
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,910
seems to be seems to be truly since only
in the browser

224
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,250
and you can actually download the every
client of BitTorrent

225
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,870
although you can hear that I am when
running

226
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,029
the game a monitor your computer's stuff

227
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:50,410
and how do they know how to determine
what's unauthorized

228
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,209
so obviously is a area of concern for us

229
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,690
now in the event the game the Texans
unauthorized third party program

230
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,190
the company may communicate that
information back to them

231
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,949
okay and again I don't know what the
word unauthorized means

232
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:11,410
and they can go ahead and grab all kinds
of higher information about you

233
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,130
now this is actually a bad thing
normally if we are trusting people is a

234
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,000
bad thing

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,949
well that's right optimize the games the
with the user bases machines

236
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:26,100
okay I can actually understand that but

237
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,370
is that all there taking when you go
ahead with and most people go ahead and

238
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,139
do online banking for the bank they ran

239
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,980
okay what happens they hit every default
thing right

240
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,100
so everyone who banks online with chase
manhattan

241
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,949
has everything the same director you the
same find file names

242
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,579
easy to snatch right off right people
Sep file-sharing easily

243
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,740
one guy one year winning grabbed a bunch
a bomb people's tax returns of their

244
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,880
computers

245
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,209
and then called them and told them you
don't realize when you have file-sharing

246
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,050
turned on you forgot to install it
properly

247
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,970
and only allow certain directories so
anything on your computer is get a bill

248
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,899
as if they're there

249
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,639
I am they may disclose everything about
you and your activities anywhere they

250
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,300
want pretty much

251
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,360
some work some turbine kinda scare me
here

252
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,449
you're responsible for all charges
incurred as well

253
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:28,130
for yourself as well as any third party
prop Ross and third-party

254
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,500
even people you do know or don't know

255
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,970
the weather without your authorization

256
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,310
I'm not sure that some force upon the
slightest okay

257
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,339
but they probably get away with bowling
a lot of people

258
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:50,550
again I'm trying to build muscle case
the same you do we trust these people

259
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,810
and that of course they come up as a
live from time to time a scan your

260
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,560
computer

261
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,899
at not the the the little thing a
president is not

262
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,029
floats thats my little attitude

263
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,529
I am steam has basal the same thing they
can scan your computer for anything they

264
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,899
think is causing you

265
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,029
unfair advantage over over competitors
which means that the skin your computer

266
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:13,380
for

267
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,860
anything for anything

268
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,680
ice a task to but finished them a task
one is not really the only big fall one

269
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,430
work

270
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,920
for those three games there is a there
is a study going on right now

271
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,290
where somebody's going ahead and looking
at how frequently a la the major

272
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,300
companies

273
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,990
are changing their online privacy
policies

274
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,300
without telling you still looking at
that kinda thing see how quick I quickly

275
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,690
changes go go through

276
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,040
alright we first thought of or trying to
figure out

277
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,779
I missed out the baseline system I might
take a snapshot the baseline

278
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,820
I'm install the software tickner
snapshot and track all the differences

279
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,110
I to know it's a simple thing to do
right this offer does that rake shot

280
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,100
with a control five does it pretty well

281
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,549
om the problem is they always actually
kinda

282
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:11,849
differ some they don't catch the same
things

283
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,899
so that kinda causal the concern for us
and I don't review SLE work previous

284
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,280
work has taken %ah graffiti

285
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,459
where we done this procedure to I am
uniquely identify software

286
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:28,640
on a some work done separately from this
so we done this process funny at times

287
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,990
turned out a software that we build the
script be a bill to take care of all

288
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,830
this for us

289
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,889
which basically does automatically
installs a new OS on a laptop

290
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,669
does it start takes a snapshot has
details things very file

291
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,730
and we were sure because its homegrown
software

292
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,870
it was catching everything changed
because we wrote the code

293
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,650
again die right rick Scott now

294
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:55,679
do I know how exactly how it works know
all I can do is black bloc tested

295
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,770
go by their words and then see if the
two-match a control five

296
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,879
that cause a problem for us because in
control five

297
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,630
doesn't do MSI files on it as cables

298
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,780
severe stalled on MSI file

299
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,789
it's not catch is that gonna work so

300
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:16,820
we're actually you son is a homegrown
software now for the next set of tests

301
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,320
we done these test several times

302
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,559
problem areas for us

303
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,780
stuff not really the installation is
always going on your computer

304
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,830
one thing we kinda forgot about I am
Lizzie was gone and do not forget to

305
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,668
mention the herd be careful with this

306
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,470
is that when you turn on when you when
you turn on the computer or when you log

307
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,630
in the computer

308
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,299
it I'm at least as checking for all
kinds of opera style updates

309
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:48,600
other all use of a second updates sarra
catching a lotta stuff that was not

310
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,679
game-related has caused some issues and
then we go through manually go through

311
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,690
all the results

312
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,440
now I was on the bill their own tools to
go through the results into all

313
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,789
comparisons for us

314
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:03,120
and actually hopefully we can build our
own tools add on to them

315
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,559
that will scan everything for us got
together mation on the Internet

316
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,010
about all the processes are being added
your system

317
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,510
I'll and we're not really completely
sure what happens in the browser based

318
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,230
game

319
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,340
show what the is that we've done so far
shows nothing's being installed

320
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,178
but we gonna have to find some better
ways of looking at that

321
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,630
I'm basically every single stall nothing
the first time you in

322
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,880
about forty mods were done and then

323
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,940
about a week later we settin this may
seem kinda funny so we went ahead and

324
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,460
just

325
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,240
star the internet browser without
logging on to the game

326
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,580
and pretty much all those mods were done

327
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,340
so the mods weren't event-related

328
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,668
done and Dragons Online we did a few
times you learn the first time we did

329
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:51,450
have a gut

330
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,890
almost twenty eight hundred mods on upon
installation

331
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,330
because it was having a lot of non-game
latest up installed

332
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,990
again the importance of some kind have
experimental rigor

333
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,289
that's why we're running these things
several times certainly

334
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:10,799
is lots of people doing this cut s
Regina lay down some kinda foundation

335
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,980
for repeatability so that way when we if
we ever actually publish the results in

336
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,200
the journal somewhere

337
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,799
all you guys and what we PT test and
find out relatively similar results

338
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,480
so basically on the future runs were
getting almost 600 changes to your

339
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,559
computer

340
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,720
after you install at and Dragons Online

341
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,010
and again the father manually checking
everything most were

342
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,270
registry changes which I found
interesting

343
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,350
I am more interested though in files
being dropped on the computer

344
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,510
especially anything execute a will and
he had DLL

345
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,870
I wanna find out those are the things I
wanna watch for

346
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:54,190
exit traffic and test three

347
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,470
I what's back up on Steam

348
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,950
had about a only a hundred area so mas
the system that surprise me

349
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,650
because I would have thought based on my
previous exposure to its behavior

350
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,400
had a problem a whole lot more mods I am
to have a try to uninstall

351
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,919
of on my laptop's want i think is my son
installed on laptop

352
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,559
and they had all kinds of problems
getting it uninstalled

353
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,940
shows coming issue is I thought oh my
gosh is a min nightmare

354
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,690
only 180 and then we put in all the
Warcraft I am

355
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,780
modern warfare 2 18 you know the 160 S L

356
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,510
but I'm not so worried about modern
warfare 2 I don't think the game itself

357
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,830
as the palm I think steam is the problem

358
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,899
his example some other files added
several prefetch files

359
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,929
I am mostly know the feet that's
directory does

360
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,520
but I try to do okay I'll soon that's

361
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,620
yes it's somebody said hell knows give
us more

362
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,730
her

363
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,610
0 when operating system runs a process

364
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,429
I well even external file on the
computer right

365
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,490
and that's a program a program becomes a
process I teach of released by the way

366
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,240
so

367
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,690
a program becomes a process by then
getting a PC be assigned to it

368
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,490
and then be in the throne into the
long-term scheduling cue

369
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,860
okay a process isn't active entity

370
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,429
the PCB contains all the point is all
the memory spaces

371
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,140
on the instruction can a week away goal
for next instruction

372
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,690
so lots of things %uh store net PCB

373
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,880
but only a piece if it is actually the
execute will code

374
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,190
I mean that the link to where to go with
this Google Code

375
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,570
so now when you process what's out that
PCB gets updated constantly

376
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,760
so I can come back in again to go back
and forth that we have multitasking

377
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,640
okay the the way it goes about building
that PCB

378
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,169
is setting up all the files it needs all
the handles it grabs all other stuff

379
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:04,490
is time-intensive when you double-click
on a Windows computer and a computer

380
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,850
what do you expect something happen
right

381
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,590
well they be used the pretest directory
wannabes are using is to go ahead and

382
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,740
have all the stuff

383
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,270
already preset each time you wanna
program

384
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,270
it'll probably have very similar PCB's
source that's all the stuff up at a time

385
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,889
okay have the prefetch is due
interesting a lot glove no love feat

386
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,440
that's

387
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,549
including a lot of investigators 1 a.m.
on my previous functions arm

388
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,690
I was spotted the ideal J effort to lay
down the arm

389
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,350
about a year technical working group to
I

390
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,970
lay down the requirements for computer
forensic examiners

391
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,419
from the associate's degree level all
the way through bachelors

392
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,770
graduate degrees and and then on into I
am

393
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,929
post-training on-the-job training tax
stuff size publicly admit

394
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:00,799
six times for over the course of a year
doing that and I'm

395
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,480
the first up marry its those ghastly I
am

396
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,429
the matter is nothing compared to this
hotel okay

397
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:15,669
I now the second which I do is what
stock what's not getting uninstalled

398
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:19,880
to see all the artifacts are being left
it was until the artifacts left behind

399
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,860
we do this also in the second of the
work that I was working with

400
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,929
this necklace that sorry I install
system

401
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,830
Demi uninstall it right away user what
everyone else will use

402
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,158
the windows uninstaller right make sense
coupley

403
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,289
everyday humans use civil looking for
recycling residuals

404
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,779
I am the company I was working with
calls artifacts

405
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:46,789
what we're looking for whatever's left
over after you uninstall

406
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,990
now playtime

407
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,830
on on i do. dozen Dragons Online

408
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,320
I was really surprised the fact that
almost nothing was removed

409
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,559
when you compare the install snapshot

410
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,770
with the uninstall snapshot almost
nothing was uninstalled

411
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,990
okay that includes arm

412
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,140
the pan dose of the panda software this
as a P&O

413
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,029
word okay a retard panda software

414
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,240
which is some kinda bomb accelerating
have some

415
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,500
move a bill to move faster from I gather
from was doing

416
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,440
on Steve my Steam the steam valve
combination software

417
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,400
actually most was removed but not steam
dot EXE steam service da TX Eastin TMP

418
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,500
to EXE

419
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,789
those kinds of things were still there
after you uninstalled

420
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,809
K which is odd because I uninstalled it

421
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:49,620
you're probably not many logging onto
anymore right

422
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,840
stott hi academia this

423
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,090
wanna be in the military whenever we're
done with the mission

424
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,120
hi folks in the military here okay

425
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,460
whenever you examine the mission the
first thing you do when you come back is

426
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,600
go over where you screwed up what

427
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,490
didn't work what expectations right
there on the ground

428
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,549
you know pat yourself on the back I and
then

429
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:18,429
maybe nowadays they do a little more but
yeah we go back we debrief and we try to

430
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:21,000
make it better next time because only
screw up

431
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,080
people die that's a bad thing okay

432
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,908
so I wish on a perfect things so in
academia

433
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:31,500
this is not well looked upon looking at
where we stood up

434
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,669
alright for you guys okay his we screwed
up

435
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:39,380
we're gonna redo everything again with a
homegrown software why

436
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:45,210
we trust mistrust that there is telling
us the information we wanna see

437
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,980
was probably look it's look it's getting
there tell you what you

438
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,559
what you what you think what they think
you want to see not what you really

439
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,490
wanna see

440
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,520
that's a problem look at so we build one
my students build software

441
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,960
that bypasses Windows calls so we can
try defeat marketing

442
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,330
and its built-in double checks in you
know I kinda stuff

443
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,559
so I wanna make sure that I I have what
I'm looking for

444
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,580
and I only do that is to write your own
software and I'm not a hardware hacker

445
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,460
by the way amasau for hacker

446
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,169
I am as a computor officer I can and I
don't know my way around however

447
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,230
somewhat

448
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,669
but I defer the hardware stuff a lot
size people smarter from short on time

449
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:28,409
rather than a bill better compared to
lose because Lindsay arm

450
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,490
has really enjoy the research I she's
looking forward actually be empowered

451
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,480
the community I think at some point much
is bullshitting me

452
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,309
I am was always possible I'd as four
thousand dollars doing this on the

453
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,480
somber them all jobs

454
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,630
arshia justify it however want to say
right

455
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,380
but she sees you be interested in doing
follow-on work and keep on doing this

456
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,880
and I wanted to take the actual paper I
love this an academic paper

457
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,620
I am got bill bennett also make a such
as do mean you only do everything on our

458
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,409
own

459
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:02,649
I essentially pain the ass om and
sometimes my teenager by all the teenage

460
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:05,710
daughter would help she's 16

461
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,840
success though that we had was we
learned

462
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,990
this is worth looking at

463
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,520
if anybody is evident dunnigan academic
research

464
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,580
we're not trying to find answers and
academic research

465
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:26,020
what are they trying to find the right
questions to ask

466
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,889
if you listen to a lot of talks here as
i've what i've listened to

467
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,919
you learn for small farms is a big deal
that's why I actually put this

468
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,289
this work and I apply for this work I am

469
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:40,539
but there also are always looking for
the right questions to ask

470
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:44,100
I think a la there may not have the
academic rigor but they have the mind

471
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,250
behind doing academic research

472
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,520
to not try to find solutions to china
fine with the next thing is what's the

473
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,460
questions

474
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,590
I think it's with the best research
comes out of

475
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,809
I'll test three monster in traffic we
only did a little bit this

476
00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:00,279
we're still working on some details I am

477
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,820
we try to sort a few firewalls lemon was
on alarm

478
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,990
he has some some some anomalies
definitely worth investigating

479
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,200
and the behavior to: and %ah steam

480
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,020
Evony had no traffic when you weren't
playing

481
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,049
we just can't expect is a browser-based
game right

482
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,250
so on the browser is open assuming we're
trusting what we see so far

483
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,919
is their issues eschewing other aspects
to the game as well

484
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,399
me play Evony now

485
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,760
okay we've we are used heavily last fall

486
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,679
as online game I am as part of a course
called om

487
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,210
vulnerability assessment so what they
had to do was we got that began on the

488
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,270
client

489
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,049
without looking at the code ever China
figure out ways you could build

490
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,418
additional tools

491
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:54,529
that would read the traffic flow that
would give us competitive advantage

492
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:59,270
and playing a game okay now have a
college class trying to figure out how

493
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,230
to do this kinda stuff

494
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,679
why like playing games no

495
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,200
a game is a convenient way to look at
all distributed processing

496
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,690
all distributed processing is going this
way

497
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,510
okay simi the same to why the same
techniques have been used

498
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:22,860
I am know suffers assault we saw so far
so that's why we use the game is really

499
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,110
an

500
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,010
a mechanism for when they get out in the
real world they know how assholes like

501
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,490
me in people like you

502
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,600
I got his attacking the software alright

503
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,610
that's the reality or trying to create
some guys have moved on computer

504
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,250
security

505
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,500
your defensive areas mostly going on the
programming jobs anyway if history major

506
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,529
and i got to tell you the first question
I get in every employer is what

507
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:50,610
are they trustworthy I'm not sure I want
to hire computer security gotta do

508
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,330
programming

509
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,428
for me and I always tell them yeah

510
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:58,289
you do casinos how people like me
attacks offer like you

511
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:03,070
it's all going online even saw for not
meant to be online back in the eighties

512
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,178
is still online even though was built a
shelf life for 15 years expected

513
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:11,340
if you've been the community along with
I had fifty by the wayside around for a

514
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,980
while

515
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,200
I am while playing video the DND client
to EXE is a regular traffic flow

516
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,250
connection

517
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,630
a consistently talks the same IP address
mostly

518
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,480
than once in awhile pops up a different
one okay it's worth looking at

519
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,140
but while you're playing you are signed
in in playing

520
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,260
deter my launcher file generates
outgoing connects

521
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,510
ensure intermittently as well I carry
15-45 minutes

522
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,440
it would do something on outgoing
connect something to pack the surface of

523
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,510
it I figure out exactly what's doing

524
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,559
okay that's why we don't trust them

525
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,210
that's in like are behaving d0

526
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,450
why is though why is the login mechanism

527
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:03,029
China talk to the world while you're
playing the game and logged in

528
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:07,019
now when you're not signed in we have a
turbine window up

529
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:10,840
is still Mason on not going connect
every 15-30 minutes

530
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,250
issues in a consistent IP address so his
leave the window up

531
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,450
as China connect the 15-30 minutes

532
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,049
even though it typing nothing in is have
it there is a

533
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:26,360
and the pixel lab they have lotsa
computers a plane on by the way

534
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,240
they're all in different stages of
install install

535
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,419
the steam traffic notes when you log
into steam

536
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,950
check time and not doing anything

537
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,470
but you logged in we saw outgoing
traffic every 15 minutes pretty much on

538
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,240
the button

539
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,470
outgoing connects at a different IP's
most packets a flag by ZoneAlarm

540
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,440
as data packets

541
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,850
some love them now playing the game as
dumping information out

542
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,870
so that's worth looking at right where
they dumping out

543
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,330
if you look at the talks film on a call
talk to the site right

544
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,210
but lovely the talks I I'm really
enjoying being here sitting on one

545
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:10,860
sessions

546
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,450
on Asher to sleep last night was
unfortunate so I couldn't get the peace

547
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,830
process all

548
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,220
but I'll the data about you

549
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,429
is much much more valuable

550
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:27,590
then the product you buy from the
company that's why I called talk

551
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,860
no free lunch team gives away a lotta
shit now right

552
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,190
the you know a lotta games by ken is a
playoff no free lunch them in computer

553
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,840
science

554
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,029
armadillos would something something
different but same idea

555
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:43,070
you the only time you get something for
free is when

556
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,240
when someone else is paying for it

557
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,700
and they're paying for for a reason very
few people altruistic

558
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,029
if volume it probably hear me more
altruistic people

559
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,899
in two or three days then you know when
your life

560
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:01,070
okay I am

561
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,299
now when the steam login window was up
but not logged in

562
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:10,690
but not logged in it doesn't outbound
connect every 15 minutes

563
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,500
and we got some all the IP's

564
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,409
up coming up wildly different the Class
A level

565
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,790
so we haven't looked at yep there might
be an explanation but simi

566
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,279
thats is amazingly suspicious also okay

567
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,570
and Ike I have to find all the files
Lindsay else has done a lot and I had

568
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,560
looked at it highlighted things like a
show them to you if we have any minutes

569
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,290
the end

570
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,469
if anybody actually cares about the
stuff interesting things I saw are also

571
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,369
been

572
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,300
yell the kinda business for a long time
when we tied in a bad password

573
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,320
no traffic was generated

574
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,869
which means was the passwords stored

575
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:56,349
the authenticator stored locally okay

576
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:00,150
which means hot

577
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,599
yep which means is it's easily get a
ball

578
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,339
I I haven't tried to get you had to stop
by the purpose or try do here

579
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:11,089
to have a student interested I made all
the money at him in the fall and see if

580
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,420
he wants to do it

581
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,089
so is all mean for us well privacy
policy this post be for you for us

582
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:21,400
but they can see why over the company's
they basically mean nothing especially

583
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,010
since they can change that will

584
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,980
chanda service this is where I called my
15-year-old son if he's around somewhere

585
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,630
he called the best by saying we can do
we want when we want

586
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,710
and you can stop us I

587
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,560
so you have 28 between 10 and 20 a pays
a legal documents

588
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,828
and they do a nice job a separating all
these relevant facts across the document

589
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:47,099
hoping that you get sick and tired of
reading it in your eyes a gloss over

590
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,880
like most people who want it.

591
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,140
security I people alright the comes down
so we can do what we want when you want

592
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,098
and you can't do shit about it yessir

593
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:01,650
I'll cover your ass I'm sorry I'm see
why is cut your ass

594
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,109
thats and was military terms I learned
okay

595
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:11,240
I am lotsa stuff gets put on a computer
upon insulation

596
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,750
I actually Russia teacher about this
really

597
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,730
but chime in on the concept I said okay
play with make shot play with a control

598
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,579
five

599
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:26,220
go ahead and download one of those free
screensaver programs

600
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,990
and I yeah weekly VM is that machine

601
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:35,790
I so I you know but she got I think in
that one

602
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,620
I

603
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:41,790
um think about 8502 so the gym a $500

604
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,400
stings chains on the Buick as a close
file attributes om

605
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,420
registry entries files added files

actually start doing this works and some

655
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,660
since May others I that is other groups
out there starting to look at this stuff

656
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,980
but they aren't doing gains Pacifica
certainly something worthwhile because

657
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,170
we can build will tall

658
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,670
the last name pair to documents very is
limit will skip a few lines in it

659
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,700
just always something worthwhile I like
the astute I like

660
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:16,090
I like to throw money as tunes I hate
when my computer science students have

661
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,350
to work at a gas station a work at
Walmart

00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,060
could not tell your students the
cheapest model abe let the final on the

665
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,720
workforce

666
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,160
they do good work in a care greatly okay
think I can answer the question

667
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,410
the answer is not yet maybe if I find
all the money thrown at us to dissect

668
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,250
things once a week

669
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:43,250

670
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,550

676
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,860
I usually only think a trip wire as a an
IDS

I'm making you so that and I'm we were
doing for to build add-on tools

702
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,470

traffic when you feel this offer still

703
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:13,830
in

704
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,869

722
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,710
easier to take a reinstall look at very
quickly now that we know the stuff worth

University I wanted a small school

776
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:07,690
actually work with students

777
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,750
up the other big schools and you have so
much pressure to bring it X number of

778
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,269
dollars a year for research

779
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:16,910
om I like working with students the
regular base I do I'd like to undergrad

780

781
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:20,670

782
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,279
I just yet more one on one with the
faculty have known

783

00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:32,960
Kusumi once they graduate

785
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,509

relationship we appears

786
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:40,460

outgoing

790
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:08,529

794
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:24,839
States hot the world the way to fix most
problems

795
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:30,078
is a three finger salute and that does
not fix the damn things in with the ways

796
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,150
of a little bit longer

797
