1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,319
first hackerspace panel and hope history
were every panelist is actually shown

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,200
up the from

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,170
safe which is good because we get to
hear from everybody for which is bad

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,920
because I was counting on to people not
showing like last time

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,340
so just give it one quick minute to
rearrange the slide

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,340
and will get started week

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,750
this

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,430
yet so how many people here have are
ever been to a hackerspace

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,510
I'm cool how many

10
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,660
how many have never been to a
hackerspace one

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,670
people remember how many how many people
are members of the hackerspace

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,750
think

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,749
member actor if you've never been yeah

14
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:09,149
actually a nice ridge we have a bunch of
people in that

15
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:12,389
can't even more keys

16
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:19,389
Nick review

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,250
and so forum filling time

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,619
hackerspace is not a word is an amazing

19
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:40,159
resource a if you live in now if you're
not a member of the hackerspace have

20
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,219
never been to one

21
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,299
and you're wondering where is one may be
near by you

22
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,659
hackerspace is got word is a place to
look

23
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,959
vere some to wiki anyone can add

24
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,280
a new hackerspace that these are
existing reforming

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,700
and you can see it's a very impressive
man

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,079
Google now with leanza pinpoints

27
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,079
it's pretty amazing some continents are
obliterated with pinpoints

28
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,630
for the maybe when you're you don't even
know about

29
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,690
if you're forming a hackerspace and

30
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,410
you're not on Hector spaces that are put
yourself there

31
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,450
%uh it's a great way to attract new
people to you that you may not even know

32
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,060
exist

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,900
but they actually a nice format for
reforming spaces

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,220
so when you richard actually does
earlier jobs internal amenity about

35
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,079
where you're located

36
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,510
time you have with your goal is and
there's a really good section

37
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,819
you can say that you're forming space
the journey space that year actively

38
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,579
looking for members are your active

39
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:41,120
project yeah that's the worst part about

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,329
on slides is that you never know watch
slide is behind you are when the slides

41
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,200
actually come up

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,980
you can keep going for a little while
you have to give me an um

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,929
I haven't slept in a really long time

44
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,870
so that free

45
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,290
just really how many of my volunteers

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,858
actually made it to the session oh wow

47
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:11,989
okay who get cute yeah I know I always
do this but together around applies to

48
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:18,989
all the volunteers all the security

49
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,079
well

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,210
everything this year i think is gone
really really smoothly

51
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,550
%uh and I hope that continues but

52
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,480
moving right along with no hi I am next
for a

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,780
I have been called the Johnny Appleseed
hackerspace in two years ago

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,590
I came here and I told all your excuses
were invalid and you are approved me

55
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,180
rights give yourselves a round of
applause everybody's building hackers

56
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,180
cases got well so what I'm trying to do
this year

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,740
is bring together a bunch of people
who've been working on pushing the

58
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,400
hackerspace concept forward

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,140
I'm calling it had her spaces for ever
the driving thing with the panel

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,140
basically in three parts first

61
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,910
we're gonna try to get as many
suggestions on how to grow your

62
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,940
hackerspace

63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,600
goals things hackerspace actually done
hackerspace that have moved

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,489
from there for space to a second space
second points

65
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,549
how hackers spaces are connecting with
the community a lot of growth

66
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,289
is about connecting with your community
whether that's your local tech community

67
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,320
whether that's everybody in town whether
that's the global hackerspace community

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,150
as a whole

69
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,130
we're gonna be talking about that and
third the point that always comes up it

70
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,419
takes up a lot of effort

71
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,469
ways avoiding drama you guys for your
shoes are invalid

72
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,030
and the way this panel is going to work
each panelist is gonna have

73
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,460
three minutes to introduce themselves
and talk a little bit about the

74
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,280
hackerspace

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,990
and then I'm gonna ask them a specific
question about their space

76
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,440
following one of the three points the
goal is to try to get through all the

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,880
panelists as quickly as possible give a
brief review

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,990
and spent a lot of time on Q&A because I
know you guys have a lot of questions

79
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,960
about Tiger spaces now that you're
actually

80
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,539
building them are dealing with a lot of
these issues were wondering how to go

81
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,390
from the first hackerspace he started or
maybe the meetings you've been having

82
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,570
for a long time actually moving into a
space

83
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,159
or how to figure out how to grow your
hackerspace from forty members to 80

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,720
members

85
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,850
how to fight through attrition and all
these other things like that

86
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,850
the panelists have done that have a lot
of experience in that

87
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,250
and summer probably right where you are
and are fighting the same stories about

88
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,590
us

89
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,240
so let's just get right along with that
our first panelist

90
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,140
is from metal out the home attacker
space is not working convene tell us a

91
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,120
little bit about the little

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm and you

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,090
%um lived closer in them

94
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,500
good up soon I'm them hi ok

95
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,940
I'm from ganem summed up like arm

96
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,410
man method has actually been around for
more than four years now

97
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,910
and have not been around when when it
was founded

98
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,289
sewn knows cutting hackers basis details
from me

99
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,930
it's good that we not moon buckingham
Drouin

100
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,320
um region

101
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,599
I was basis very open so basically

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,590
whenever remember is %um the key members
you

103
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,599
sweetie key member very literally

104
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,340
everyone who has the key is a key member
even

105
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,580
this approximates 24/7 and by

106
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,390
open I don't mean you have to call and

107
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,150
a before you stop by but everyone can
stop by

108
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,820
anytime as long as the someone present
with the key

109
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,419
arm this some

110
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,469
some spaces do this differently and you
your love

111
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,050
but those as well um

112
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,320
we have 200 square meters of space

113
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,180
we've been going strong for four years
now in the same space

114
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,500
um I think we're doing pretty well

115
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,050
%uh last year I made some statistics

116
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,050
um we had one even

117
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,750
birdie in average into space this can be
used in meetings

118
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,539
upward huge a Cox the true love

119
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,860
all the first base so it's very exciting

120
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,099
thank you in 10 things we're talking
about beforehand

121
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,659
is this notion sort of connecting the
two points together

122
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,310
what sorts of things about connecting
with your community

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,210
have helped fuel the growth than that 11
upheld keep it a very big

124
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,430
and vibrant space what is it exactly
about

125
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,720
can the way the middle that connects to
the community that helps a grown helps

126
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,150
continue to be a good space

127
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,280
mmm to be honest must suffer

128
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,750
connection to people use by offering
stuff that's really interesting

129
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,810
own we've we've had two use when

130
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,270
when there were a few even view open and

131
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,639
few knowns things happening and weary
diem

132
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,350
a.m. that was have significant
difference in growth

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,540
when we had do

134
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,139
um givens compared to when we have lots
of events

135
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:23,130
had lots of interesting book shops and
we've been pushing our members to

136
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,510
'em tell stuff %uh give workshops
because

137
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,159
the tagline is basically in one the few
here

138
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,860
has at least one interesting thing to
tell me done

139
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,949
know shit about simply Stella

140
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:42,978
things and it will be a very interesting
experience for everyone

141
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,290
a great thank you now moving on Berlin

142
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,500
space I am reading at my name is Karl

143
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,410
and honored have crash space in Los
Angeles

144
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,550
and according to our card and the
Collaborative Research Association

145
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,319
official activity at the hackerspace
located in Culver City Los Angeles

146
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,060
is a place where people who are
interested in a wide variety of topics

147
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,770
ranging from

148
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,089
science and technology and to electronic
fan art can get together

149
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:13,560
and see how things work and find things
that can be built from the park

150
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,060
and we executed a car because I think

151
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,610
as a mentor to many people didn't raise
their hand red

152
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,370
asked whether or not people have been to
hackers bases and we thought it was

153
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,329
important to have a little color

154
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,730
I my hackerspace when it is actually
here

155
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,370
outta New York because I was at the
interactive telecommunications program

156
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,220
for a couple years as a student

157
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,360
and then as I read a researcher there
and so when I left New York everywhere I

158
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,750
went I was like

159
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,140
where's the hackerspace give a new and
wifey resistor and where's the place

160
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,089
like

161
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,500
ATP program where people can figure out
how to do things and

162
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,800
I can find one and then I was in Los
Angeles

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,110
and I was actually at a party and I met
someone who I'm was like

164
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,900
well I know this guy he wants to pound

165
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,089
crash we started from a at my mom in a
crash

166
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,150
Fran that made a I'm

167
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,939
we have a for two hundred square foot
space in Culver City

168
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,120
I it we've been open since January

169
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,420
and we have our membership you get a key
for you 24/7 access

170
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,079
and people can stop by but they do me to
have a member with them

171
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,949
and their not in her I we've got a lot
of open event

172
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:27,600
I never tried it more wave and

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,140
yes that's pretty much something up
don't that sounds great

174
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,439
we're talking before and you told me a
very interesting story about the camera

175
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,310
in your space

176
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,000
butter very interesting tag give us a
little background about

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,300
that unique ways to circumvent its and
potential drama

178
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,530
your space I'm well you got on a
hackerspace is done word

179
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,699
website you'll see a lot of design
higher than 1mm is about the bike said

180
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:56,010
and you know having too many too long
conversations about like what color to

181
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,300
make

182
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,400
and I think it happens to a lot of
hyperspace is we have a camera in our

183
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,930
space right now it's mostly just a
security camera

184
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,980
I'm we don't publish the feed although
where

185
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,150
were again having conversations about
what to do about it

186
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,360
I whenever members actually within the
basin didn't want to be incorrect

187
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,180
he just imploded so I we had a

188
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,810
restrain the conversation a meeting and
but basically abandoned not

189
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,900
we're all like but this is ridiculous
and

190
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,740
so I think our about his organization is
really to engineer solutions rather than

191
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,020
legislative solutions

192
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,020
though if we don't want people to I'm
hunt the camera make it to you cannot

193
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,350
and when the camera rather than have a
rule about I'm hugging the camera

194
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,140
so we're trying to keep our legislative
ever had as

195
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,660
minor if possible because no one was in
force anything

196
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,990
so if we can't engineer in a way for
someone not to do it

197
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,270
then we can't make a rule about I which
is

198
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,839
you know actually keeping it on a pretty
low because there was like no you didn't

199
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,620
do this and you're supposed to do that

200
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,230
a legacy that someone can like hit
someone over the head with the were

201
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,760
suppose to you

202
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,630
and that it's not funny or I so that if

203
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,089
so engineering solutions rather than
legislating and it's what we tried to

204
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,050
do.

205
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,920
awesome SoCon you were big mover and
shaker behind

206
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,569
getting hackerspace open in Los Angeles
and you're also a member to hackerspace

207
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,730
in Singapore

208
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,910
right um give people a quick little
introduction

209
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,640
to you and then sorta explain that
dynamic the difference between being a

210
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,560
mover

211
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,709
and hackers facing a member hackerspace
and went to be

212
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,589
either one when am okay so.i

213
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:37,970
among the founders a the space in Los
Angeles and

214
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,330
I'm has actively been involved with that

215
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,500
the talks in Los Angeles to try to open
after space for about

216
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,399
four years three years or something and
then finally just said

217
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,790
bike fuck it Amanda sign a lease and
then hackerspace and then we actually

218
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,040
got one after that out but a pretty good

219
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,149
an and then and because the business and
stuff I travel to sing for all the time

220
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,850
and I am and a buncha guys there reserve
at about the same point

221
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,910
as we are hoping the hackerspace the
other this Singapore hackerspace

222
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,730
open about two weeks before we opened
our space in Los Angeles

223
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,240
and so joined them as well just to

224
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,190
you know serve tied to communities
together but also have base reckon

225
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,690
working do anything there but as a not
in Singapore nearly as much time in Los

226
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,350
Angeles

227
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,450
I didn't want to take on any seeming
ministry roles that I do in Los Angeles

228
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,100
0

229
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,640
I don't vote on what color the carpet is
our worry about like

230
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,170
which which room the walkers get put in
in Singapore

231
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,060
whereas in Los Angeles take more sir
active role in

232
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,930
side lockers go

233
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,430
awesome next hour match also anybody's
been to the hardware hacking area

234
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,339
I really have to ask for special round
of applause for Mitch

235
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:02,339
and the also program

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,370
so bitch tell us a little bit

237
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,400
about Noisebridge for those of us who
are not

238
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,770
in the in the dough soon Noisebridge

239
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,069
gives me by my voice is goes away and
conferences and it's already happening

240
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,390
sorry but a me and Jake

241
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,880
started Noisebridge after going to chaos
camp

242
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,030
and Berlin if every if anyone has never
been to such a thing

243
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,170
go way out your way to go to camp 2011
coming up in August

244
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,300
totally amazing a bit at the camp 2007

245
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
does the talk go giving the design
patterns for starting your own

246
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,130
hackerspace in me and Jake

247
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,390
were both there from San Francisco and
knew that we were going to start a

248
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,900
hackerspace when we got home

249
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,340
along with them a brief from NYC
resistor an

250
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,190
Nick had BCE and love

251
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,460
we did it are that's all it took so

252
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,070
all hackerspace is start from you know
one or two are a handful of people just

253
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,880
doing it

254
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,930
and you start by creating a culture that
you want

255
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,240
the culture that mean Jake wanted was

256
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,210
the you know hippie freak up punk weirdo
anarchists kind of culture

257
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,330
so that's what we created and

258
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,330
it's grown from there as cultures are up
to do and it attracts more

259
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,790
the punk free weirdo anarchists and

260
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,069
I love it and some if anyone is a hippie
freak punko anarchist type

261
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,650
and once to visit Noisebridge
Noisebridge is totally open to anyone

262
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,699
always 24/7 if any of you out there are

263
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,130
thinking you might come to San Francisco
on one a key I have plenty of them I'll

264
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,820
give you one

265
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,620
and you don't have to be a member to
have a key um

266
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,710
we're open 24/7 so it's really no
problem if anyone comes in and no one

267
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,360
knows them

268
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,970
they're greeted when they come in and
people show them around and if any of

269
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,210
them start leaving with any of our stuff

270
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,330
people kinda say 'em

271
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,120
Heidi up that's our stuff

272
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,030
so we have one rule only one ruling we
have no leaders

273
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,120
the one rule is be excellent to another

274
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,510
it it actually works

275
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,650
because we have a culture that's grown

276
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,650
that we have enough overlap for this
very subjective concept of excellence

277
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,130
but it's up to all of us to perpetuate
our culture and help it grow its

278
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,330
you know it's a work in progress and our
so we tell people

279
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,130
when when we think each others being
excellent as well as when we think

280
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,610
people are not being excellent

281
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,250
walking out with stuff to excellent so

282
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,050
mom yeah that's that's kinda Noisebridge
were very very diverse very open

283
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,180
and there's anything from electronics

284
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,110
and craft and photography and music and
video

285
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,010
and food we have a full kitchen slowly
the

286
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,470
building a bathroom over the last year
are we have 50 to 100 square feet above

287
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,800
total chaos that is embraced with total
anarchy

288
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,339
and it's wonderful if you're ever in San
Francisco you should definitely come by

289
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,099
you are totally welcome

290
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,920
while sounds great I i cant wait to make
it to the

291
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,370
the second space to say oh I think I was
there actually something the first one

292
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:30,179
so you it seems like a lot of what
you're talking about people

293
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,820
encompassing the term radical inclusion
what do you think the really big

294
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,928
benefits that why should a space

295
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,220
open up itself to everybody and try to
be as inclusive as possible what sorts

296
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,640
of benefits do you get from that

297
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,880
that a more clothes Thacker space might
not experience

298
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,270
Golino um nose bridge design definitely
the extreme side of total openness and

299
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,480
that's not necessarily the correct
approach for all hackerspace is

300
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,410
on not every grouping of people might be
comfortable with that and if you're

301
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,440
thinking of starting a hackerspace you
should

302
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,600
create a culture that you are
comfortable with on the Noisebridge

303
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,679
mean Jake started it this way cuz that's
the culture we wanted to be a part of

304
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,310
so for us it works incredibly well

305
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,950
on hackerspace is just like hacker
conference is all about community

306
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,419
which they're so precious little in our
modern day world

307
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:27,260
and being together on the Internet if
you can call that together can be

308
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,929
really positive experience but being
together actually

309
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,270
in person like all of us are here is

310
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,310
total magic what can transpire just from
a a little

311
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,220
love quarter to body language can set
something of a new direction in life

312
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,419
and when you have a whole hackerspace
full of people doing this for one

313
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,460
another and sharing in growing

314
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,840
it's amazing and the more diverse the
better I think

315
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,220
%uh for people who fit in with the
culture so when we make ourselves

316
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,010
totally open

317
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,040
we invite Ian the world

318
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,610
I mean literally the world people from
all over the world they land in San

319
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,560
Francisco Airport near first stop is
taking the BART

320
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,260
the subway to the station a block and a
half away from us and they bring their

321
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,330
backpack and they're at Noisebridge

322
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,960
in the smiles on their faces are amazing
and what they share

323
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,040
is amazing in what they're learning from
all of us there

324
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,080
is amazing for them I mean everybody
wins as things ideally should be for all

325
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,449
the love life

326
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,540
so people of all ages as well

327
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,879
there's kids from middle schools and
high schools as well as college in all

328
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,540
the way on up to

329
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,210
a know people in the eighties people

330
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,270
learning and growing in sharing from one
another in all these ways

331
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,250
which is enhance the more open we r

332
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,760
spaces that are more clothes might be a
better for them because they're more

333
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,120
focused

334
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,770
um maybe not as a ver so they can go
further with certain topics I don't know

335
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,830
it depends on the grouping

336
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,879
um but for us having this brought
everyone welcome has

337
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,980
in love really on apps

338
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,030
fucking cool

339
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,280
awesome thanks much so max for those
that don't know tell us a little bit

340
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,610
about NYC resistor just give a brief
overview

341
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,200
so NYC resistor is a one the older
hacker spaces in this new generation %uh

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,050
vector spaces

343
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,810
kicked off after %uh Triple C um

344
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,870
basically two remembers George and Bri
fetus

345
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,740
up went with her Mitch out to Triple C
camp

346
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,530
which as he said before something you
should definitely go to I'm Ingenium

347
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,050
mention it to a harder last a

348
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,659
last summer and it was it was really
special it's amazing to go to either

349
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,270
amended so they came back they
immediately want to get the space going

350
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,590
and they kicked off in it it's been
around for two years

351
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,139
we are different from my nose bridge in
so much as be

352
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,780
set up in a way that's actually
relatively different from most of the

353
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,649
other hackers basis as earlier on the
scene

354
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,560
we decided being in New York where you
have you know space limitations we

355
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,120
wanted a small group of people

356
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,990
more for the meeting more for the
managing space

357
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,160
when we hit 30 people on our last base
our first building we ran out of shelf

358
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,710
space we ran outta

359
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,260
access people would come and it would be
places to said

360
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,830
um so we started with a exclusion

361
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,040
up rule which was things like boy for ex
boyfriends ex girlfriends can be in the

362
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,860
space

363
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,440
nights anyone can be to anyone else for
a legitimate reason usually

364
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,820
a we don't go after like the best
hardware hackers are the best offer

365
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,540
hackers

366
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,990
%uh we'd be like everyone it's just a
matter of sometimes he gets when it

367
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,840
comes in is

368
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,260
maybe a little crazy day a geometry and
a

369
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,450
they've had to take issue with the use a
triangles you know

370
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,780
this can happen there's some pretty
crazy people out there so a

371
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,870
we week went with the marks was very
role and we also

372
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,970
incorporated instead going in as a as a
5-on-3 see we thought it would be easier

373
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,060
and it has opened options for us that
otherwise would have been there

374
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,510
however you have ends up being wanna be
more strange

375
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,190
Packers basis although successful in our
own right

376
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,320
and so in with your sister just like
Noisebridge

377
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,340
move relatively recently into its second
Larcher

378
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,080
space what sorts of things do you think
people should embrace

379
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,129
as they're preparing to move perhaps for
their first read more incubator space

380
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,159
into a second larger space both in terms

381
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,520
up utilization the space and changing
patterns within the organization the

382
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,620
people as a whole

383
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,750
well especially in any situation like
this where we had been around for two

384
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,940
years we've had been doing really well
we all know each other pretty well at

385
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,740
this point you're bringing in people

386
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,470
you know cherry picking them and we had
a really good community established

387
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,530
that's kinda a problem as well as for
the great thing

388
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,230
the problem is is you don't wanna rock
the boat and in moving to a new space is

389
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,500
a real big change so there's a lot of
things to be afraid there

390
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,520
in my case I was afraid we'd all burned
to death a

391
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,980
we had a really great place that we
could want start fires on the floor

392
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,850
would really be a big problem our new
spaces like from the eighteen hundreds

393
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,730
and I was kinda concerned with

394
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,600
we'd all burned to death is things like
bricks on the outside but on the inside

395
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,380
its like another self

396
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,610
for every person is something different
that is Evans got concerns and big new

397
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,530
space bigger space means new members

398
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:35,070
different culture %uh that's culture
shock

399
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,139
its just a million different things like
to change

400
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,620
what you know if your space but have
been word

401
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,919
I it's been amazing actually we've got a
whole buncha members who were

402
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,190
all great marceca looking for even more
which is another huge benefit

403
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,960
on the new space is allowed us to do new
things but I think at this point

404
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,570
we've kind of taken last month or two
just to chill after doing like a

405
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,730
three or four months build-out new space
means doing a lot in new work

406
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,290
lay down your floors new CNC equipment
is brought in

407
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,720
you know new projects are kicking off
because we have all this extra space in

408
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,640
this opportunity

409
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,350
so lower Knauer we'll see

410
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,510
awesome and I think you actually made it
the whole way through a presentation

411
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,780
about a blatant row against somebody

412
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:22,629
oh we do excluder gingers for

413
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,200
I was waiting for that and then of
course we go right into a ginger

414
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,540
afar from High City 6 tell tales little
bit about them

415
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,408
Phillies hackerspace the awesome I'll
have 76 is in downtown Philadelphia

416
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:39,290
were on the fifth floor in arts building
so that means we're through with a lot

417
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,560
of people individuals to use from artist

418
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,790
both hobbyists and people who make their
living doing that on we'll

419
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,190
about 1300 square foot space and

420
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,399
about eighteen to twenty members are no
exactly how many

421
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:55,300
om so we've been around for about a year
a few of us

422
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,310
decided you know we he's

423
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,540
wanted space we want to build something
you want to do some cool stuff

424
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,620
so we ended up just getting a Lisa knows
about three of us and we went around

425
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,320
you know weaver hands in the air we set
up a wiki set up a word press

426
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,730
set up an email account love and then
just are gonna tell people hey you know

427
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,890
come build stuff come hang out to make
things annum

428
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,070
had an open house every Wednesday and
then just one by one

429
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,530
to buy two people search showing up in a
in make cool stuff happen

430
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,950
um so this is actually the second
hackerspace Philadelphia

431
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,350
that you've had the opportunity to to
build up a little bit

432
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,280
and then having been involved in the
formation process to hackerspace is

433
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,080
water some lessons from both

434
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,040
you know it not only in terms of the
building is agassi's but growing the

435
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,330
whole tech community

436
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,899
in philadelphia is a whole that you
think you would like to tell

437
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:51,570
you know yourself maybe two three years
ago when he started out on this journey

438
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,408
all I think the biggest one out of
myself is something actually learned

439
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:59,140
from starting to hackerspace and then
serve getting I'm sort on the fringes of

440
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,210
the startup community in philadelphia

441
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,929
and Philly has a really unique approach
where everyone realizes that it's not

442
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,050
us versus you its

443
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,220
Blake its collaboration idea its
collaboration set up and you have to

444
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,020
understand it

445
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,500
there's other people that are doing
similar things and in some ways you may

446
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,390
indeed be competing you may be looking
for the same members

447
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,590
it could be three spaces and your
friends can only for to be a member one

448
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,250
a which space to rejoin are but that
doesn't mean that you should Clarion

449
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,500
that doesn't mean that as a whole

450
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,080
ecosystem if not a better choice it's
far better to have two spaces in the

451
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,939
area

452
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,580
then have no space in the area arm in my
case there is better than

453
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,658
unfriendly forget first between couple
spaces

454
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:41,179
and after a few months sll me realize is
actually better because there's

455
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:44,590
different audiences the different
interests and as long as you know

456
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,630
group had decided re: things are cool us
relax

457
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,679
it was actually really nice step two
spaces because one gives you incentive

458
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,210
do some cool stuff

459
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,770
and you know to it serves different
audiences and it was actually record

460
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,620
highs I think

461
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,679
you know there's enough people in Philly
doing this to support all these

462
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,169
different add two spaces

463
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,240
that are you know really the similar
idea the idea is

464
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,970
let people do things encourage people to
learn give them the tools to do anything

465
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,250
and you know we have four different ones
that are slightly different you know

466
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,649
all around the area alright

467
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:21,200
um and then gym shoe here up next to us
a little bit about makers local 256

468
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,480
and I am from mayors local 256 and
Huntsville

469
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,750
Alabama we started and 2006 there is
about 10 of us meeting and

470
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,880
different people's apartments decided to

471
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,649
get a shop in 2000 8

472
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:41,120
where we grew to about 20 members and
then moved again in 2009

473
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,500
to a bigger place where about 2500
square feet now

474
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,790
workability donation based we don't have
a minimum

475
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,889
membership fee and everyone's welcome we
have open events things like that

476
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:58,750
we make on things like portable for both

477
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,450
women forge to classes

478
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,550
parties things like that

479
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,120
a.m. basically Huntsville's really kinda
unique in the fact that we have a big

480
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,350
tech community that's

481
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:18,340
so it brings what I've like-minded
together

482
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,040
cool and then because armored serve
leading the way in one area actor spaces

483
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,270
in the US you guys actually through
conference agassi is made up

484
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,418
com almost little you know that you're
gonna and you're doing it again

485
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,940
and this is actually exciting
announcement that pattern and programs

486
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,620
the panel so tell us a little bit about
the

487
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,850
like a space-based US arm sold last year
we

488
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,669
decided that wanna see what would happen
how to create a budget hackers faces

489
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:45,090
together to

490
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,659
you know talk about things at work on
projects and and

491
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:53,050
October of last year we had about 500
spaces come down to

492
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,370
are our space on which kinda you know
threw a party with a big cookout

493
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,230
everything

494
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,440
and I'm just can announce talked about
things did a

495
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,929
did some panel discussion things like
that and so this year

496
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:08,010
and November 12 to 14 really doing it
again

497
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,929
on whichever hotel set up and maybe even
some

498
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:14,980
some camping is if you as my campaign on
so

499
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,020
her on we do have a space & Rocket
Center City Kan

500
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,899
stop by that also %ah the me more
information up on makers local .org

501
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:26,350
of course like hackers we are we don't
do things the last minute or something

502
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,399
up there yet but

503
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,770
it'll be up there soon awesome

504
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:35,290
okay and then um Alex from hack Miami

505
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:40,370
to deliver at Miami a going we are just
are meeting around the

506
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,659
around August 2008 right after the into
the last hope

507
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,780
on we are coordinated through the
hackerspace is that our website

508
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,030
and we start meeting at Florida
International University

509
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,790
arm we became very comfortable with
their facilities therefore up for about

510
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,590
a year

511
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,860
on they had a near pretty much
everything you need to

512
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,250
to give were weekly schedule talks and
we stardom

513
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,800
scheduling talks every two weeks and
promoting them heavily through with very

514
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,919
social networks Facebook Twitter

515
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,050
on the jet Google Groups and that's
primarily our building

516
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,980
people coming out we had about twenty 20
weeks have about 20 to 25 regulars who

517
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,720
come out

518
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,830
on and then about them we officially
became a incorporated non-profit

519
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,470
arm and February 2009 and then earlier
at the end

520
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,100
earlier this year we are hosting the
hacking terrorist networks talk

521
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,620
and arm a.m. from what from what I heard
I guess some people from

522
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,409
in for guard were interested in the talk
and they wanted to come out so they are

523
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:36,700
the they they gave a call FIU to find
out arm

524
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,120
exactly what the details were in all
assign FAA is likely hackers

525
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,280
terrorist some FBI thing get out at the
school

526
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,720
and obsolete quickly had to find another
space and

527
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,300
we we had a warehouse that was on
donated to us and we're able to

528
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,840
really use this the second floor it but
we're in the process of getting

529
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,810
electricity

530
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,810
into the warehouse so in there in the
meantime

531
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,230
wearing that we're in a transitional
phase where where where we are

532
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,490
a a pizza restaurant that has a

533
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,800
that's a very it's it's a good setup
though they have a very big Tom screen

534
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,820
stage a nice projector a whole buncha
tables

535
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,510
and really expensive beer and good pizza
and arm

536
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,679
we've meet there every two Saturdays and
we get a we get it

537
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,359
a decent crowd 20-25 people come out
regularly and on were

538
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,720
we're looking to hopefully get
everything finalized by the fall for

539
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,379
warehouse where we can actually have

540
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:33,159
go and have a permit space there so
that's a pretty unique story

541
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,379
going from meeting space to getting a
warehouse donated put electricity it

542
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:40,980
um well I'm glad I didn't have to go
through that and and helping

543
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,850
get back to see going what sorts have
lessons are coming out at that sort of

544
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,119
growing experience this

545
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,510
having a persevered through all those
various different steps

546
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,000
all we we definitely learned that on
social networking

547
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,619
is i'd definitely help because we we
found our space through facebook

548
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:58,570
comedian the

549
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,060
we found our the pizza the pizza place
to Facebook when we

550
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,460
didn't have any place to to go through
so jazmine

551
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,580
maintaining good contacts on social
networking sites within

552
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,970
love people within the local area you
you can search out on

553
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,629
they don't wear our primary focus is a
hacking in information security so we

554
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,040
just search people with those interests
on Twitter and Facebook

555
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,580
start adding them a majority them with
would follow us back

556
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,020
and arm and would start and began start
participating

557
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,369
and arm from an organizational
standpoint home we

558
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:32,280
did have a bit we did have a bit of
trouble arm initially after incorporated

559
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,350
citing on

560
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,750
deciding on bylaws and exactly what type
of a nonprofit structure is going to

561
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,960
have was gonna be a member-driven not
structure

562
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,700
a nonprofit structure a border nonprofit
structure and Om

563
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,109
initially we decided to go with the
boardroom a nonprofit structure where we

564
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:48,030
have just a few board members are kinda

565
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,520
direct the administrative affairs and
and everyone else's

566
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,609
would be considered a a volunteer that
and they pretty much

567
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:58,230
guide the direction the the space in the
talks the

568
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,190
no the the actual projects going on
where's the board is kinda

569
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,740
focusing on getting electricity in the
warehouse

570
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,080
rock on and then rounding outs for the
group a schedule panelists i tech for

571
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,310
alpha one let's talk a little bit about

572
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,230
New York's I guess seconds big
hackerspace

573
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,060
sure alpha-1 labs start out

574
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,530
here though was

575
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,649
my original inspiration for starting a
lab was

576
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:31,010
and all these inventions inventor and
engineer

577
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,908
and I had this invention night but I was
gonna take millions of dollars

578
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:38,659
may collapse you know with all these
women and I'm

579
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:42,409
two years ago there the hackerspace is
talk here hope

580
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:46,320
and they went through all the design
patterns

581
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,020
and I learned a lot from that and one
day I'd

582
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,020
call then money expects that or call in

583
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,740
and they're discussing few issues are
going on through the hackers bases such

584
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,720
as

585
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,270
getting her spaces a.m. stuff like that

586
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,050
and I thought well let me just put this
all together

587
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,168
and start something and we decide to

588
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:13,359
phone was rich I heard they had a
remembers a time I was like wow that's

589
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,500
awesome

590
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,540
so we took on a radically inclusive
method

591
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,770
and we try to keep the place safe and
clean for all ages

592
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,250
make it easy for people to sign a which
has been a minute major factor in our

593
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,080
growth

594
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,699
we have taken on the duo Chris the
method nose bridge where the more you do

595
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:39,700
the more infants you have in space

596
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,820
and during our meetings on Tuesday at 7
p.m.

597
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:48,099
we'll go around for six minutes getting
updates pretty much similar to this kind

598
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,800
where everyone has a voice to direction
for space

599
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,240
on for a move we actually sort out a
small space paying for a last month for

600
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,260
rounds

601
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,940
and this caused by an thats that give us
a could boost

602
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,380
to get going an hour in a six in a
square foot place

603
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,830
and we found during the move that the
most important thing to do is

604
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,460
but tougher right away get things
organized

605
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,020
and help us with our medical spaces that
consume we've all been proven

606
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:22,210
its from so is going better and for

607
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,460
today whenever sunrise party in the hope
everyone can make it

608
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,130
yep as a reason the fire system
recordings

609
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,540
they're they're up there homie have some
here come up get them

610
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,599
after talks over cuz cuz such action

611
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,599
bring those fires pretty hard for
perhaps present at

612
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,630
just a quick show fans who is received
or seen one at some point the conference

613
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,240
okay good I knew the Reach is bigger
than that

614
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,690
okay cool so wow we got to the schedule
pen was pretty quickly

615
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,570
and then we have one special guest star
choice from heat see clouds

616
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,920
um tell us a little bit about your
unique setup an approach

617
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,040
forum building your hackerspace there's
a hundred

618
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,170
a Johannes your highnesses extra extra
special

619
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,550
guess surprise start the ferry and

620
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,599
and plus he's also the end because he's
gonna wake everybody up with this

621
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:17,780
ridiculous Austrian antics but

622
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,820
but that not true that so much joy
stress please tell us about

623
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,500
heatsink labs hi I'm from Phoenix
Arizona

624
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,810
and are hyper space is called heatsink
labs I'm so we're a little bit different

625
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,849
a couple were founders got together and
they got excited about this idea

626
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:36,260
hackerspace and I'm so were based on
this place called gangplank which is a

627
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,830
collaborative

628
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,848
started incubator which they feel like

629
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:44,660
we have a lot offered to them so they're
offering us free space

630
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,569
there so are based on their we have a
rep wrapping your space project

631
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,720
and a lot of other people working on
different different projects

632
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,770
I public meetings are held twice twice a
month and then

633
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,470
members can come in and use our our
resources

634
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,920
also we hold an Arduino night every

635
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,099
every month to get people excited line

636
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:13,730
who don't know about crime aren't

637
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,630
for cool in and you're at it

638
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,550
during a unique space how how does he
sing connect

639
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,599
with the community around its like a
starter

640
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,880
talked a little bit about that the take
place if you think thats has its

641
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,390
neighbors

642
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,000
okay so I guess is a big eyes on mine
owner

643
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,450
hyperspace in 0 kind of like startups in
fact that

644
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,740
you are trying to run business but your
hollinger never

645
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,740
you never ever going to get rich I'm so
it does take a lot of work

646
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,190
and you get me to hold a lot of fund
raisers so that have the money to buy

647
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,650
the equipment you wanna get

648
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,750
so we hold a lot of administrative
meetings to trying

649
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,670
raise money for to to be able to
purchase things like a laser cutter

650
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,930
and how these resources that people want
to come in and

651
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,060
collaborate and work on

652
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,020
alright cool and we're doing really
really well on time so Johannes

653
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,050
don't screw it up tell us about how bus
.at and your extra-special announcers

654
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:20,010
gather it's allowed so know my name is
Johanna some part of monochrome

655
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,380
and I'm the only member of the panel who
cannot wake under the table

656
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,490
and not BC

657
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,820
so hacer just like a year ago

658
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,980
we had monochrome and/or but Vienna we
were thinking

659
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,840
there is a space in Vienna its really
awesome I member of its medal at

660
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,880
but we have to have a certain form of
mobility

661
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,920
and that say if the hackerspace is

662
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,920
to an embassy we need a

663
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,330
X certain form of like people going out
there like ambassadors

664
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:57,619
to spread the information the main
problem is

665
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,410
for we can be very honest about that

666
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,480
there will never be a hack space double
penetration

667
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,810
montana okay so there so many spaces out
there

668
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,779
that nobody gives a shit about but
they're still interesting places because

669
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,849
there are people out there

670
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:17,290
so for example a year ago we started
packed bus

671
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,340
in Austria help us .at and we finally
got a bus

672
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,730
we got it working and in June we toured

673
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,869
through Vienna just yen not going
outside be started in Vienna

674
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:34,090
and first the of June 21st district
second day of June 22nd district

675
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,140
up until like the 23rd district in
Vienna

676
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,140
and every day we had between thirty and
250 people

677
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,410
coming to us checking of whatever doing
DIY workshops

678
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,140
building like basic stuff like let's
throw aways whatever okay

679
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,190
and reached more people then be

680
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,099
belief that we could reach and most of
those people would never ever

681
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,700
set foot in a hackerspace so the basic
idea is

682
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,840
and it's an old ideas so many had buses
out there

683
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,650
especially in the United States you know
you know you've cheap fuel

684
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,369
more in a Anna so

685
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,750
the basic idea now is other various

686
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,849
hackerspace s dollar and today it's an
official announcement

687
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,359
a it's a quote from year we want to
start help us start in four

688
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,480
which is a community site for all the
heck buses

689
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,170
and mobile hack a spaces out there

690
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,180
so please go to help us thought info on

691
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,419
and registered a bus if you have one and
I know what I talked to so many people

692
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,380
here at Hope

693
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,250
yet couple of more by the heck spaces
and hike because out there

694
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,940
and the basic idea is it's a long
there's a long tradition of hex base

695
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,440
a mobile hex basis and help the cause
and help us this

696
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,490
and it's a real important tool to self

697
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,800
empower people these units a

698
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,660
should be everywhere you should start
one yourself you don't have friends

699
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,580
for done it yet a please go to our site

700
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,240
at your bus if you have one or check out
would be we do

701
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,050
it's a pretty plain virgin kinda side
right now because I just put it online

702
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,790
you know like twenty-five minutes ago so
for

703
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,340
you can be there from the start help us
start info

704
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,280
and I hope you'll join the movement and

705
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,480
good luck with that and I hope that the
help us movement can support

706
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,950
the hackerspace is movement yep also

707
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:37,950
Gigabit Router across the panelists

708
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,720
and the second round of applause because

709
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,490
this gigantic panel made it in under
forty five minutes agendas

710
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:52,010
ever been done attacker on ever

711
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,849
okay so now I'm sure you guys have a lot
of questions that have not

712
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:59,960
I'm going to throw them out the panel
and as well I'm also going to be

713
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,339
going to the website so I promised on
the panel said I would be visiting the

714
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:05,820
websites that their hackerspace is they
came up during the course the

715
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,950
presentation

716
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,540
now the slides are done I feel
comfortable enough that if somebody

717
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,560
mess the wireless I don't do it it's
it's still okay so we have

718
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,849
our first question and when you ask
questions you got a microphone up front

719
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:21,119
and a microphone it back please line up

720
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,609
and we'll try to get the questions as
quickly as possible and

721
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,740
I M absolutely encouraging a discussion
here there's something that

722
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,900
somebody asking a question strikes

723
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,099
a need to respond in you go up to the
microphone and

724
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:37,490
and speaker voice not be alternating
between the one up front and on the back

725
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,040
so

726
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,690
introduce yourself real quickly speaker
and microphone and 3 a question at the

727
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:46,119
Palace you wanna answer it

728
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:49,880
I'm from Calgary with the XP since been
open for

729
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,190
per year and I wanted to know how

730
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,430
other groups are handling collaborative
projects

731
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,310
are the approach that we've basically
taken is everybody goes off

732
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,490
and does it themselves up until certain
phase

733
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,859
and then we look at what different
people have working

734
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:10,339
and Trent Cole s it over there but arm

735
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:13,950
since we've never actually finished a
project at this point I be interested in

736
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,170
seeing

737
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,830
you know what your experiences are with
us %uh things that take this one from

738
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,830
the Middle up

739
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,520
we do it this way up

740
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,349
really most of these projects go like
you said someone has an idea

741
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:34,160
implemented and them up people cider

742
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,399
come in and ask around watch they're
doing and will join in

743
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,839
eventually but a.m. many project

744
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,890
actually a come

745
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,470
together cook in a collaborative way

746
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:52,130
thanks to our lunch face so

747
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,089
um if you're about to have a smoke
assume

748
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:59,450
um should try

749
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,730
having one and I'm a non-smoker

750
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,500
and I'm actually opposed to how we
handle this

751
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,310
in some ways but this has been an
incredible

752
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,390
source of projects and source of
discussion

753
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,890
for us those been to startups

754
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,450
no three start-ups up found that

755
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:26,240
in that room in four years and just a
footnote that

756
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,099
will also remember that the med lab
isn't Austria where'd

757
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:34,690
they have a smoking machine every three
feet on the street just like in New York

758
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,010
they have ATM every three you can buy
cigarettes

759
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,240
in just as many places and the end as
you can get cash New York City's

760
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,990
remember that about the smoking like
that

761
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,680
then from based insisted

762
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,078
written I don't maybe you can see
something as an alternative to the

763
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:54,849
smoking room

764
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:58,329
get in line and tell us what it is I'm
but did any other panelists wanna take

765
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,190
on the clutter projects question

766
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,920
for yeah arm behind his condition I'll
most people

767
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,329
are most of our products are from one
person's passion and someone comes and

768
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:07,740
says

769
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,200
I really want to do this check this out
I something going and a lot of times the

770
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,849
first time you again it's very close can
also show your

771
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:16,750
and by about the second and third time
somebody shows up to meeting with this

772
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,579
great project

773
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:21,950
it just people are attracted to that you
know like fruit flies on

774
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,819
Annapolis been to New York for a week
and just you know you see something

775
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:26,819
passion about something

776
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:30,049
and you really want to help them out you
really wanna see sexy succeed

777
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:33,400
especially if you have skills that you
can help them with or they're learning

778
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,490
you can help along

779
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,690
arm and we do have our share projects
where they get

780
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,750
you know authored a way through and
people like okay cool that was funny

781
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,609
when I want to learn they don't wrap-up

782
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:45,990
but almost four projects are really
there sir passion driven by different

783
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,809
individuals

784
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:50,829
and %uh they bring to the group and then
they you know pull collaborators from

785
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:54,109
from the group eldest

786
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:57,630
at footnote Noisebridge being the
anarchist on

787
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,130
weirdo and all that stuff kinda myspace
um

788
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,230
its when someone is passionate about
something it doesn't necessarily mean

789
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,490
that other people will be but if people
are passionate about it then it does

790
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,910
become collaborative and that's those
are projects that move forward

791
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,359
and ones where other person is just one
person may be the disc off on their own

792
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:18,049
and there's no collaboration

793
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:22,599
bomb or maybe just kind of falls by the
wayside in favor something else

794
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,869
and a with within our culture people to
think

795
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:30,869
except that is OK because there's so
many so many creative people doing so

796
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:32,140
many creative things

797
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,420
is always something %uh that people
confuse yes to get behind

798
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,490
and against my better judgment

799
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:44,789
but I did promise that good alternate
the Mikes Irish what's your question

800
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:48,150
so mister far do you really have a posse

801
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,279
hook

802
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:55,359
this I'm actually glad that their reach
if that showcase gotten

803
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,538
so little that it gets that little bit
at the lapin a Friday night

804
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:02,130
and and I'm gonna let

805
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,410
open flight role on this one just to
wake people up so

806
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,779
I mitnick bar at a begun three hi I
remember the exact not this story

807
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:16,029
I Moreno I'm serious he was the
organizer that conference

808
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:20,390
and a wonder because actually ended with
police dog sniffing everyone leaving

809
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,210
but a to give you an idea of how much a
posse

810
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,990
as the first night that I've we ran into
him his his posse was carting another

811
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,960
hotel with a blood-alcohol content that

812
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,930
probably exceeded ethanol I'll so

813
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,509
yes Nick far does indeed have a posse
he's still here today because it

814
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:44,509
next question

815
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,799
lil yeah so my question is initially

816
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:53,710
for far by if anybody else has anything
about it

817
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,750
are you talking about the different

818
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,609
the spaces been in your area

819
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:04,690
and I was wondering what the differences
are that drive people to go to the

820
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,670
individual spaces geography thing or is
it the

821
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:11,480
more operational differences like save
difference between

822
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,640
you know Noisebridge n/a more restricted
space or something like that

823
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,828
what drives that are mostly thing that
drives the different communities

824
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:23,099
is a different needs a different desire
from the people involved are

825
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,160
a little bit its geography which is like
head on a drive three hours

826
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,660
but most of it is am i'm looking for.
just sure our

827
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,149
million for are in really great
technology up some people they don't

828
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:36,099
want to be involved in a week to week
basis and there's actually really great

829
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:36,440
make

830
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,619
group called make Philly and it's a once
a month me for two hours

831
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:43,940
and there's a you know that that crude
really they don't want to be involved in

832
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,349
Akers base they don't wanna buildings
every week

833
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:51,059
they don't happy the need to pay to be a
member of a space that they use for two

834
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:51,670
hours a month

835
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,690
but for something like me Philly on you
know that's a perfect fit

836
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,490
and so we've done up actually creates
jobs very different gene yourselves

837
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,500
and understanding like how the different
groups you know if there's somebody who

838
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,140
really wants to start up a sale uk

839
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,900
come the hive you like our style stick
with it but we also have cordoned spaces

840
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,020
and here they are and you know they do
the same for us so

841
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,079
um New York's kinda interesting in so
far as we have so many different groups

842
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,960
alpha-1 labs a NYC resistor there's
there's other groups %uh

843
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,359
Madagascar Institute right near us the
book smart welding there's been other

844
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,180
groups that focus on

845
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,490
biking we have a ATP we have Polytechnic
University we have

846
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:32,329
a million different subgroups academic
are technology

847
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:35,539
office around all do normal things got
twenty million people in

848
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,819
a very small location so each animal
individual spaces defined by

849
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:44,529
quarter as her anything you know smoker
people get together and find that space

850
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:46,079
is so they're going to find it to be

851
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,559
what they think is the optimal design
pattern and

852
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,230
I guess I result in us having a bunch of
different spaces so

853
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:57,240
offensive question

854
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,230
and three into the back yeah I guess my
question would be

855
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,849
up for grabs arm high Kingdom is a
pretty homogeneous even

856
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:09,680
there's a whole lotta why the white
dudes that are predominantly straight

857
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,160
are yet hackerspace is to find
themselves as

858
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,240
community centered and open

859
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,480
so there seems to be a disconnection
between the two I'm just wondering if

860
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,470
you folks

861
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,660
identify that as a challenge arm first
the mall

862
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,649
maybe you don't see it as a challenge
but if you do how have you just that in

863
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,579
the context of your space

864
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:36,500
Noisebridge was started by two queers

865
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,009
so um

866
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:45,049
and a so I like being part of a diverse
community san Francisco's a very diverse

867
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:45,829
place

868
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:50,480
a.m. but the still its predominantly
white

869
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,109
there's Asian people love you know
Indian subcontinent included

870
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:59,180
people from Pacific Islands and arm

871
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,599
people from Europe whatever but now
predominantly wat

872
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:06,079
predominately middle and upper-class arm

873
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,509
and its majority mail but we're doing
pretty good as far as female

874
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:14,609
11 when I was treasurer keeping track of
all the membership it was forty percent

875
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:15,950
female

876
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:19,029
I watched pretty good so thing is um

877
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:22,779
we don't live in an ideal world and

878
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:27,450
what we're doing is creating not
necessarily an ideal world but an ideal

879
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:30,759
%uh aiming towards an ideal for the
world we want to live in

880
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:35,650
locally %uh leases as I see it and
inserting Noisebridge

881
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:40,630
so I want to attract all sorts of people
right now there's more females at MIT

882
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,660
than males

883
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,629
little bit I it's because younger people
growing up it just doesn't matter

884
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:50,369
with her before doing electronics was a
boy game only in now to grow game girls

885
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:51,730
were discouraged

886
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:55,239
when I was a teacher and electronics I
had for four and a half years of

887
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:55,859
teaching

888
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:59,308
three females in all of my classes put
together

889
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:04,630
arm so doing sort of our own minor
affirmative action kinda thing creating

890
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:08,140
stuff that in the past was predominantly
girl games

891
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,058
to bring people love not just the
youngest people were just doesn't matter

892
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:13,500
anymore but people

893
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,910
love 'em you know twenties for use on up

894
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:21,569
are getting more crafting things which
is prevent predominantly a growing make

895
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:24,920
love making sure that we had a lot of
activities like that

896
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,400
attracted more people who are female %uh
my you know Noisebridge has people

897
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,489
love in determine gender %uh and

898
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:36,640
we encourage that to %um I'll we make
sure that

899
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,019
we have holy zero-tolerance love

900
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:44,099
homophobia and sexism and all these kind
of things

901
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:50,710
um that is not excellent file

902
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:55,359
from we want to have a a safe space for
everyone and whatever people want to

903
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:55,788
teach

904
00:52:55,789 --> 00:52:59,710
known again you not to be a member to do
anything in his budget but remember to

905
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:03,489
take classes or even to give classes so
were always out

906
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:07,539
up being ambassadors in the community
the in San Francisco and everywhere we

907
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:08,289
go

908
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:11,589
say hey we got the space you know you do
some pretty cool you wanna

909
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,130
teach a class there and if there are
other people who want to take it then it

910
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,420
takes off

911
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,779
and you know if it doesn't cause by the
wayside makes room for something else

912
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:25,200
but as a result of that we've gone we
diverse kind classes that attract all

913
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,770
sorts of different people

914
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,259
not just middle and upper class which is
the predominant thing but

915
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:35,140
since oliver stuff is free attract
people who don't have money to do just

916
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,230
funny thing but here's a cool space
where they can find community and

917
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:39,829
therefore it attracts them

918
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:44,200
and they bring the friends tracks more
so that's how you handle that

919
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,190
I you honestly want to respond to this
week but let's keep it quickly sink as

920
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,079
many questions as possible

921
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,130
just very quickly I mean yes I a I was

922
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,599
to go with my friend Frank a just like a
year ago something like that be

923
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,020
published

924
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:03,520
a small rand let's call it or like him I
don't like a paper on where we

925
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,730
we must said page we have to hack our
own tax basis because there's so many

926
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,319
spaces out there what is not a single
female member

927
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,279
or where like Germany for example
there's some tax bases

928
00:54:14,279 --> 00:54:17,539
a in predominantly let's see Turkish
neighborhoods

929
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:20,660
because it's cheaper live there but
there's not a single Turkish member in

930
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,799
the heck space

931
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:25,230
I did so predominantly by et cetera et
cetera et cetera so there has to be

932
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:28,950
definitely some former outreach and this
outreach can be

933
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,859
either the old way of liked just like
talking to people

934
00:54:32,859 --> 00:54:38,549
for I mean 50 percent of the population

935
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:41,890
for talk to them okay for

936
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:45,660
your and it works pretty well

937
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,808
a sometimes it scares them away but okay

938
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:52,289
your and thats I guess why

939
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,910
today we wanted two large double the
heck help us to infer sites because

940
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,920
that's a different approach to attract
people

941
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,190
for Mike in no way be interested in
hiking but

942
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,559
the have probably interested in like
tinkering around the doing cool stuff

943
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,140
people just like not call the packing a
whatever

944
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,288
so I think there has to be a fire

945
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:16,250
wider outreach projects for hackerspace

946
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,270
ok getting a good can

947
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:23,920
winning actually and this is beyond did
everything I don't hear community when

948
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,390
you're

949
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,969
when you're talking in your meaning your
offense think about that you say you

950
00:55:27,969 --> 00:55:28,529
can't a

951
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:32,219
applications and electroluminescent
semiconductors are you can say build

952
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:33,509
your only after

953
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:37,289
and there this team subject matter and
you get way more

954
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:40,460
the second one and you can teach them
all about diode

955
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:45,039
to go in one way you know oh you know
there are two types have

956
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,359
material and what it's like sends like
turns out when

957
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,859
track n you can just you can cover the
same material you can get to galleon

958
00:55:51,859 --> 00:55:54,200
doping you can get all that stuff
eventually

959
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,239
the redline have to be something
appealing like

960
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:01,779
through the internets as a busty like
electroluminescent semiconductors case

961
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:05,289
%um allotted was room get excited about
the first one

962
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:08,930
but if you want to bring in people who
are scared

963
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:12,829
honestly I think it's harder than it is
cuz honestly LED's are not rocket

964
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:13,369
scientists

965
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:17,950
like they're not like they're not hard I
and felt like making sure that your

966
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,029
language

967
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:23,349
is it is it the barrier

968
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:27,589
and I think I just wanted to choice do
you have anything to say about this and

969
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:28,489
also I i

970
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:32,039
promised you that output it's a class
website up on the screen and I did so

971
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:32,980
wanna make sure he sought

972
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:38,210
I but give a any kind of response to the
question diversity in her car spaces

973
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,329
I think just

974
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:45,809
as the female hyperspace community it

975
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:48,849
people are like females that definitely
are interested

976
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:52,700
but it's not a question on whether or
not way we can do this because there's

977
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,640
not a female engineers out there just
gotta

978
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,069
just like anybody on just tell them
about it

979
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:02,880
so that's what we're trying to do

980
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,440
cool back up front but

981
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,430
area um so have a question for the panel
in general

982
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:14,849
I know some guys have a love diversity
for your hackerspace is

983
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:18,759
werner said all you guys have two things
in common one you're located in a major

984
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:21,259
city into your lease near space

985
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:23,940
how do you feel about quitting
hackerspace in a rural community its

986
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,059
viability

987
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:28,400
and also using a member's house

988
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,420
its practicality for all the members

989
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,200
think as far as location it doesn't
necessarily bike

990
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,160
their major cities because that's where
there's a community-supported but that I

991
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,430
don't think that that's

992
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,480
necessity that have been a city that
this has to be a community supports

993
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,259
itself

994
00:57:45,259 --> 00:57:50,489
if you have 10 people her if you decide
that it takes ten people to run a space

995
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:57,489
in your rural area

996
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:02,710
so the if you have the people the sport
it doesn't matter where it is

997
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,440
you know you could have one in in the
middle of nowhere if everybody in that

998
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,349
area was into it you know so

999
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:11,369
location is a matter for not everyone
just enough people rate yet uncertain

1000
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:13,440
about but I mean if there's like on the
three people

1001
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,900
and Mike 50 square miles you know and
all three those people are into it and

1002
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,940
run with it

1003
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,950
just through this one out the audience
how many people here are

1004
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:27,520
members over /url hackerspace are trying
to start a rural hackerspace

1005
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,460
okay week

1006
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,940
okay going to get and how but I

1007
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:41,210
I forgive me forget forget my and I
don't know what the word is right now

1008
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,140
the top my time but

1009
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,460
how many people are trying to start a
hackerspace not in a gigantic

1010
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:50,580
goblets for crime and disease okay so

1011
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,450
so few more than that's good and anyone
else in the pen want to pick up the

1012
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:55,210
question for

1013
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:58,300
yeah I actually serve the housing
cooperative in Rochester New York

1014
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,870
because I concert a hackerspace

1015
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:04,040
arm basically I found this group people
like hey we're crazy fun people who

1016
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,860
wanna live together my counter workshop

1017
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,030
and i ended up putting the workshop in
the basement and then since they were

1018
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,080
cooking food in

1019
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,240
rebuilding the house and doing awesome
stuff i jus got involved in that

1020
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,660
so I think your things that hackerspace
doesn't have to be

1021
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,740
I mean it doesn't have to be just like
stand-alone thing being in somebody's

1022
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,540
garage

1023
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:24,150
being in you know a business who says
you are you guys really awesome will

1024
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,270
open our doors you know

1025
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,410
Friday's you can come in userspace like
you know there's there's a lot of

1026
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,799
flexibility people can have

1027
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,120
and you know after you know you have to
start all over you can find a group

1028
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,109
that's kinda somewhere has the same
values

1029
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:40,650
and and work with them also the person
who owns the space has to be

1030
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:47,370
really email does so there's the
hackerspace design patterns 10 the

1031
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:48,660
patterns is

1032
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:52,620
about sense of propriety of ownership so

1033
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,759
if from one of the members is

1034
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,580
a landlord um even if it's an incredibly
mellow cool person

1035
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,620
some their priorities a

1036
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,900
well might take priority over what for
rest for the membership the hackerspace

1037
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,860
might be so there might be potential
conflict it doesn't mean that

1038
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,800
up it can't be resolved but there is a a
lot I've

1039
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,740
mmm situations that are right for
conflict in there

1040
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,880
are so the design patterns are rules

1041
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,680
their patterns for what is worth and not
work in a quarter-century of hackers

1042
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,830
bases in germany

1043
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:31,730
so there's a lot of experience behind it
but there are many hackers bases that

1044
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,040
exist that violate

1045
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,020
these patterns but to do so you should
do so consciously

1046
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:41,310
I if the only barrier to starting the
spaces you can find one but this

1047
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,259
person's offering you the garage

1048
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,730
why would you not do that how is your
like Great Bear

1049
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,250
like having a hackerspace is better than
not having acker space so if

1050
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:55,370
if that's the only thing but britain
know that going into into something

1051
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:55,839
where

1052
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,490
rates at somebody's house or something
like that brings with it a whole bunch

1053
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,890
of other problems that you wouldn't
necessarily have to us

1054
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,069
starting from scratch someplace else
Alex even jumping in the car

1055
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,140
you know it when it that's what were the
issues that's why the issues that we

1056
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,029
weren't we're dealing with this arm

1057
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:13,100
where it actually have a space in if
you're trying to start one up

1058
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,330
i'm looking to the your local
universities your code

1059
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:19,770
on community colleges libraries those
are a public facilities and if

1060
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,820
if you're able to become a nonprofit
organization which

1061
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,250
without the 501 C three stuff just the
nonprofit in your state

1062
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,260
arm you'll be able to get free access to
that just you

1063
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,520
I guess don't have weird law enforcement
subgroup scholar school about

1064
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,660
acting terrorist networks and you'll be
okay but up for a vague for the most

1065
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,109
part

1066
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,580
from take advantage a public facilities
and also reaching out to local

1067
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,880
businesses because they've been more
than helpful with us

1068
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,220
a we're gonna throw it back up to the
back right

1069
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:50,150
good evening I'm curious how much

1070
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:53,780
entrepreneurship there is and the
hyperspace is and whether

1071
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,940
that causes any problems a.m.

1072
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,080
actually a we have a rather large and
successful business that's a

1073
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,779
been growing out over space for about a
year and a half I guess now

1074
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,760
a it started out in this extension of
the repre- projects one of our founding

1075
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,450
members eyes ako can

1076
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:15,850
was about the beat research guy word
wrap up foundation

1077
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:19,230
one other members in the audience today
is actually one of the founders of

1078
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,910
what's called maker bot industries

1079
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:26,470
and maker bot started out inside NYC
resistor using NYC resistor

1080
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,980
resources most notably our laser cutter
um

1081
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,770
in the early days it was a huge problem
but a as they became more and more

1082
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,390
successful and start growing

1083
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:39,100
and demand for their %uh their printers
grew a

1084
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,830
in our little space we suddenly had a
large amount of wood piling up in our

1085
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:43,580
wood room

1086
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:47,920
and said that suddenly they had interns
overrunning the laser 24/7

1087
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,980
so the over the years I guess

1088
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,170
they ended up buying their own space
moving their own without their star in

1089
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,320
their own stuff and

1090
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,810
eventually carting some of their larger
amount above

1091
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:01,830
laser cutting out to outside vendors

1092
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:05,779
but for a little while they're there was
definitely some a some issues

1093
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,500
popping up where you know members can
get access a laser cats are waiting for

1094
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,240
to our run the finish

1095
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:15,150
and then just as I finish want their
interns with you know stake in their

1096
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:18,660
quickly replaced with another two hour
run in it

1097
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,830
it definitely I got on people's nerves
and was a

1098
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:25,590
definitely an issue um it to get to the
point where I think people are starting

1099
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:26,750
to you know

1100
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,310
really draw some concern but in the end

1101
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:33,630
I think a when they finally did you know

1102
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:37,290
get their own facilities a it quick you
know it quickly went away as a problem

1103
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:41,050
in our in the same building as they are
they actually found a new space for us

1104
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,740
so that ended up being a great thing for
us and I relationship has never been

1105
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:45,800
better

1106
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,360
there great guys and they're still
members so we have

1107
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,390
we have so how that from on other
perspective

1108
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:56,080
is that we have a member who started a
company and

1109
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,190
and had a bunch of a quarter I guess

1110
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:02,410
the fact that he became a member and had
a space to put it was an excuse for him

1111
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:05,440
to go get a bunch of equipment so he
wasn't coming into use our equipment

1112
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,540
he brought a mountain equipment with him
that then

1113
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:12,100
buttress the space can use as well as
sort of like his contribution to it

1114
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,210
yeah I have to agree a make about stuff
like attributed large amount of

1115
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,170
equipment

1116
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:20,160
resources even technology in just
expertise in visitors

1117
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,950
I'd choices here and is absurd incubator

1118
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:28,280
do you think that on trip certain
influences your spaced it does that have

1119
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,810
an impact you think

1120
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:33,460
it's kind of interesting because um
their

1121
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:36,810
45 other companies in the space that
we're working on and

1122
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:40,500
they're starting up their own businesses
in we also have an aunt here

1123
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,970
in our group who is hosting the servers
for

1124
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:48,110
hitting clubs so um will collaborate I
think we

1125
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:51,170
bring something to game-playing which is
where we work

1126
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:56,200
and then they bring something for us
which is free space

1127
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,920
and make sure to wrap it up yeah so um

1128
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,780
I make a living off a my personal
project that became popular

1129
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:09,400
and Noisebridge and everywhere I go I
encourage people to quit their jobs that

1130
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,810
they don't like

1131
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:14,730
and in favor of doing something you know
making time to explore

1132
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:17,990
what you love if you find yourself in a
position where you're doing something

1133
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,410
you don't love

1134
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:24,049
arm you know when you wanna quit your
job you'll see me but to add Noisebridge

1135
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:27,110
I A R I do this lot and

1136
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:32,220
many people at Noisebridge now use nose
bridge as one of the resources

1137
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,600
for their own kit business or a

1138
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,280
using computers there with sorta like a
coworking space for people can

1139
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,410
be in community while doing their work
and this has not been a problem at all

1140
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:49,370
at Noisebridge we have 50 to 100 square
feet we've not grown at this point

1141
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:55,049
so um I see hackers bases as a way above
all a bus freeing ourselves from the

1142
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:58,790
yoke of cubicles living

1143
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:03,029
okay next question

1144
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:07,310
its the people at their actress case
love and miss you remember me

1145
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:10,810
away Vienna you know constant Iran

1146
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,930
hun I mean our I

1147
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:17,470
the guy who hit the tech museum a
regular talk

1148
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:21,810
yeah at that stage for say hi okay to
challenge is this

1149
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:25,830
come to at one o'clock in morse room
tomorrow

1150
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:29,299
I'm gonna put on a challenge to anybody
wants to work with me on this

1151
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,360
idea now said dispute 1 o'clock

1152
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,070
at the at the Morse room

1153
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:40,640
thank you mister crunch and in back

1154
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,680
for civil I had a our solution for the
smoking room was

1155
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,420
which is built an arcade but a couple
really comfy couches it works pretty

1156
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,350
good

1157
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:52,339
so cover no drinking no smoking earlier
but arm

1158
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,980
like mostly those stories I've heard
when we started off

1159
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,880
we had a big meeting a bunch before
excited and

1160
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,710
then over who's gonna be this position
is going to this and other rules came in

1161
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,000
and

1162
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,460
most people like we're done so just two
of us

1163
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,420
brand started problem is we do need
people to do the treasure role when

1164
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:15,270
manage all that stuff so I guess we're
not quite like North Noisebridge were

1165
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,790
not

1166
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,790
completely you know free love but we're

1167
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:22,170
we don't really have a rule structure
you know latter

1168
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:25,650
members and all that stuff seekers any
suggestions for trying to keep that

1169
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,970
simple in nature gets done by EOD

1170
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,730
not you know regimental

1171
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:38,320
chrome to join

1172
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,520
%ah

1173
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,610
do when you're starting at be prepared
to roll up your sleeves de la Torre

1174
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,600
yourself and

1175
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,630
I'm hire me have

1176
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:52,120
I you know I'm a man aged 83 funny but
it's really

1177
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,440
I I think we try it we're trying to
harass you suppose to use like you

1178
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,210
suppose

1179
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:59,780
yes it's a pity that we're trying to get
it as low infrastructure as possible

1180
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,830
at my be in town for three weeks is
probably get

1181
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,380
make skated there is coming into town
will allow an act

1182
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:09,860
what if things were trying is all I
getting things done on little no cars

1183
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:10,820
and about to board

1184
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,210
and stuff like that also you know be a
lower rate is

1185
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,149
and I like what really has to get done
like if you're paying your rent and

1186
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:20,299
you're paying your insurance and you're
being the things that need to get paid

1187
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,720
I'm if the membership if you're really

1188
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,200
open and inclusive and a membership if
they wanted to make it happen

1189
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,450
he could be really clear like that it is
for the weak economy

1190
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:34,170
organization where you know you're not
telling them what they can or cannot do

1191
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:37,620
with a space but we've got some great
memories when this started radio Monday

1192
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,779
he was really interested in all things
like ham radio or WiFi

1193
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:45,819
or Xbox until he started radio mandated
aspiration he just started

1194
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:48,870
I another member wanted to have a
handmade music night he didn't have

1195
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:49,970
permission is like

1196
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:53,820
basically I wanna do this let's begin a
I mean anything and making sure that

1197
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:55,069
that posture

1198
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:58,599
the people who are in charge even if
they're

1199
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,290
they're not in charge they're just
getting it is getting get shit done

1200
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,850
and if you a showdown and you could do
better than them you do it

1201
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,210
and so making sure it like that posture
like

1202
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:13,620
is clear that y'all trying to reach your
dog a screenplay

1203
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:18,059
and no one is more important less
important but you know the do %ah crispy

1204
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:22,230
on and just if you want to see something
happen make it happen
