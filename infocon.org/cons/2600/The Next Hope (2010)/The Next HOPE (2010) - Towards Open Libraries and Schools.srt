1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,670
reasonable place and %uh Sanders

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,700
I'm on of took some time so you may have
seen me there

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,150
if you've been to help before I'll you
may have heard one of my other talks

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,650
on what I've been trying to do my talks
I know

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,990
I can see the audience this very tragic
okay good but I I like to see your

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,269
smiling face is coming up like stack

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,880
present and anathema oh you want to see
the screen to you

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,820
weekend internet just pretend your head
roll cages

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,170
I'm so %uh mile of last talk I gave here

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,920
I E talked about and the young ladies
illustrated primer which is the

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,460
magical technology which educates youth
and Neal Stephenson's book the diamond

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,850
age

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,030
on spoke I really love hands I want two
things I was talking about is how

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,670
the technology was really not the
solution a book if you're looking

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,130
carefully the kid who just passed

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,630
is the kid am sorry from spoiler anybody
on this one but the kid who does best

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,410
the kid who has a

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,739
a dedicated teacher working with a very
actively through the technology so the

19
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,600
point there was that

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,689
people are at least as important if not
more so

21
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,359
on to the equation far getting
technology and education

22
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,539
I'm so this time around what I really
wanted to do

23
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:20,569
I'm tell you a little about what I've
been doing for the two-year sense to

24
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,950
give you a context if I am thinking
really hard about this

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,060
and livestock brought these two lovely
other people on account today

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,170
on the past two years I've been working
on my dissertation which I like to say

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,520
is about stupid on the internet nobody
says that's

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,479
awfully large in a way of a topic I but

29
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,719
others very specific pattern that i'm
looking at an output actually quickly

30
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,060
here

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,810
has my dissertation it on the internets

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,359
on so for example

33
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,950
remember how my two sons

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,709
anyway are you not you not getting
science wing it over there shocked

35
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,179
oh I don't need to get shot we are not
splintering

36
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:05,869
you need to be enslaved actually don't
you need to see this it's okay I'm

37
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,179
was gonna say is so-so basically I was
looking at misunderstandings on blog

38
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,080
comment threads

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,870
and that those would be along the lines

40
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,080
a and they'd go

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,470
for example me when the actual up dude
is actually showing up now

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,930
lol matchup so for example I'm a blogger
would write

43
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,959
I want to see my publishers television
talk show maury came on and he had

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,680
everybody get up and dance then he said
something really stupid to somebody

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,860
the and and a commoner would show up and
say dear maury povich

46
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,189
I hate to bother you but my family is
very ill

47
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,680
I was hoping we could get on your show
and you could do our

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,610
make a dream come true thing or also for
example

49
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,730
I a cot a blogger wrote %uh

50
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,179
I had a really hard time can sleeeeeep
fax here's how I made it work you

51
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,280
texting fax service

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,300
and the Commodores came up and said
please cancel my fax service

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,380
I don't want it anymore what's going on
here so

54
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,980
the response to this pattern was usually
the blogger or the bloggers regular

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,100
readers coming up going

56
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,420
what the crap I'm not maury povich I
can't cancel your e fax slash

57
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,500
a well slash Google I don't even know
how to cancel cool hunched

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,850
yes you can is it showing up it's
showing you have to overtook

59
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,090
I'm okay

60
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,489
and now can I see it too okay I Q spend
eternity

61
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,720
on america's I now thank you we not mean
be

62
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,720
we know how it works meets but okay so I
am

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,980
and this is really meant as your site's

64
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,050
every go this just in she has real good
at helping people

65
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,060
technology that's why she's here today
on so

66
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,830
right socda mister sometimes so the
response usually

67
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,360
to %uh this kind of thing would be I

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,730
not just something on the order I love
on

69
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,810
why are you here or

70
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,510
why don't you understand what's going on
but would be things like get off the

71
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,340
internet and don't come back

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,420
or for example please get a clue remove
your ovaries and please don't reproduce

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,680
cuz we don't want you in the gene pool

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,350
so as I'm reading through this you know
you begin to think the commenters are

75
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,270
pretty stupid but the waters and their
friends are pretty stupid too because in

76
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,349
terms of doing like

77
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,210
good training of people to teach them
how to do things right on the Internet

78
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,440
they're not doing it right like they're
really being very offensive so

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,330
when I really wanna talk about today was
on how best to work with people

80
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,090
specially

81
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,960
in schools and libraries to get your
technological goals Matt

82
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,250
on specially if they're in with getting
open source software and

83
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,870
but just you know generally helping
people to understand technology better

84
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,500
some others or to frame this by going if
you've been saying to people

85
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,180
remove your ovaries get off the internet
don't come back it's time to stop

86
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,330
that's great for the internet dozen or
so well in real life

87
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,599
so on I didn't feel like I had that much
to say about this

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,690
aside from that on and I do know people
who I thought were

89
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,900
better at this just last is an editor at
a community manager medical turn

90
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,470
I also the Minister of Labour and dotnet
which has been really active

91
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,680
and not swerve providing a a place for
on

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,880
letter interest in technology to gather
I'm she's also just is really neat

93
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,320
things with Patriot Act if you could
tell a story about a

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,409
the great sign as a sign she put up live
racing CIA

95
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,740
CIA or the FBI FBI has visited that was
new

96
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,020
but it was so cool she did I'm so she
says is that the FBI has not been that

97
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,650
this library

98
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,030
watch for the removal of the sign cuz
you know what to say

99
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,169
that the FBI has been there so I'm
that's just mean Justin

100
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,960
can talk about at getting technology and
libraries on

101
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,849
Ellen Meyer is sweetness and light
personified she's whatever professors at

102
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:52,770
Teachers College

103
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,890
to teaches that technology is cool
change class from which I learned a

104
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,510
great deal

105
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,250
and she made be the person that you sent
to albany

106
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,740
onto get technology in schools but she
also soldered your own computer by hand

107
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,270
back in the day to build computers a
casing that respect

108
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,180
few jokes they respect I just let them
take over from here and we'll adjust to

109
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,909
the first to left

110
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,349
week that's fine was fine unnerving
displace now

111
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:26,030
saves lives thank you

112
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:32,479
patients

113
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,919
patients okay I'm

114
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,049
I'm sorry I'm a short person behind a
top 30 a.m.

115
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,300
and I can see it think so I'm can be
leaving the back okay

116
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,500
I just meant West I am i

117
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,460
labor and a work in rural vermont I run
the blog Metafilter

118
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,320
I try to teach my brains had a sensibly

119
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,780
use technology and so when we talk a lot
about technology instruction a lot of

120
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,010
what I need is not necessarily

121
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,090
each this is how you get your email
although I think my main

122
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,190
job well talk about that a little bit
but it's how to teach librarians enough

123
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,820
but technology to be able to pass down
technology know-how to

124
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,589
people in their communities and it's
really important because for an awful

125
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,490
lot of people who don't know how to use
computers are you don't have access to

126
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,460
the Internet home which is more people

127
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,219
than you would think I often the library
is their only source of rare public

128
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,800
Internet and so it becomes this giant
problem

129
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,570
because they don't know what the hell
they're doing in there on the Internet

130
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,260
like

131
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,539
gas is talking about and people holler
at them and then

132
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,979
they get off the computer and they don't
get back on again and

133
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,360
did you know that has the intended
result of the up

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,409
the torches and pitchforks brigade but
then when you've got Obama saying

135
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,560
now we really want you to get online and
file your taxes or when you've got the

136
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,300
Federal Emergency Management Agency
being likely get two choices

137
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,300
your house is under water and you can
call us on the telephone

138
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,589
10 file to get your money or you can
fill out this form on the Internet and

139
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,659
that's really not a great time to be
sitting around doing

140
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,930
internet cell that's way think it's
important I'm to talk a little bit

141
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,550
briefly about

142
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,260
digital divides kinda my hobby horse and
I talk a little bit briefly about why I

143
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,219
think it's important and the things you
might care about

144
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:18,390
being the community of people who I
suspect actually know how to use

145
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,289
computers

146
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,180
he and what your role is possibly moving
forward and and why your library it

147
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,469
doesn't seem to know what the hell
you're talking about when you show up

148
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,899
with you

149
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,270
thing and you're like can I do the
namely when

150
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,399
you like your suffers terrible sir so

151
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,700
this is the explanation that so this is
my library in the town

152
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,870
were right this is actually a picture
right yeah okay great

153
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm how I computers

154
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I mean really like and kinda many
discussions are you like

155
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,339
you can figure out computers so I spent
a lot of time trying to build actually I

156
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:53,899
can

157
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,940
and lots of people can't sell quit
saying that so I'm also worked libraries

158
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,600
and schools this is my town

159
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,620
library in the town where I live in and
ran off from we've got four thousand

160
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,300
people

161
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,620
this is our library I worked there
occasionally I'm

162
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,370
TG now 20 people which is kinda my
favorite part of the job

163
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,870
like giving somebody their first gmail
account is really kind of a neat thing

164
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,470
because they're like only Koch the
internet is full of people here like

165
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,620
telling you that but actually when it
becomes real to them

166
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,149
often getting them an email account or
ugly themself

167
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,820
good news bad news on the go leaders on

168
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,500
but I love my job and I love my child
library and I feel in there occasionally

169
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,930
I mostly work medical terms like my real
job job believe it or not

170
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,800
that pays my bills I work at their local
high school teaching you not all people

171
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
and then I casually work filling in the
library

172
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,589
where the penny eight dollars an hour to
work as the labor like I have a degree

173
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,690
in librarianship and but that's what you
do if you work in rural communities and

174
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,740
so

175
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,050
the other people that I work with its
not that surprising that they're not

176
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,480
necessarily

177
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,890
I people spend a lot of time

178
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,140
working with computers are even search
being hobby computer so

179
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,589
good thing I have internet job so that I
can canopy making bill but I live in

180
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:12,380
town

181
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,250
and I see a lot of people who are
affected by the digital divide the town

182
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,980
I live in

183
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,720
we have internet the town next to the
town I live in

184
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,779
doesn't really have internet kind of a
problem for them

185
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,830
I'm now I'm not any kind of like Ackert
a person I actually know how to type

186
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,720
words into Google to solve my problems

187
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,490
you know so if you type jailbreak iPhone
into Google and you can read

188
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,480
seriously you can do the things that you
might want to do to

189
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,080
own your own stuff you know I miss the
sort of Android hacking on your phone

190
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,820
thing but

191
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,370
seem kinda right like we live in a
blessed time were mostly what we have to

192
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,019
do

193
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,720
is tight search and read to solve a lot
of our technical problems

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,890
we don't know how to do them ourselves
its it's amazing its

195
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,880
its jetpack City rate but that's only
true if you understand be tight shirt

196
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,589
read

197
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,200
situation so I don't code I don't I can
I create a style sheet

198
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,500
I can like mess around in PHP enough to
leak fix my

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,760
word press something or other but I know
how to follow instructions and I'm not

200
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,630
afraid of my technology

201
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,670
so I'm like to jailbreak your iPhone why
then I can do that

202
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,130
I don't know I'm and it can be like any
worse rate but what am I gonna do

203
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,120
media have to buy another one and so my
concerned is that

204
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,700
people being afraid of messing with
their devices is often afraid their

205
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,940
freedom money

206
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,030
and they're afraid if feeling stupid
because they broke the thing and then

207
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,630
the person who's telling him to take off
their ovaries is going to be like

208
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,510
well I can fix it but I already told you
what's gonna solve your problem

209
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,780
sucks right sucks so on its all the
control sorta like the digital divide

210
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,130
I'm I spoke at South by Southwest you
know suffers a flask any key

211
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,540
esto douchebag kinda stuff heard a bit

212
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,170
self different crowd you have to talk a
bit different six right

213
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,819
why should the people at South by
Southwest care about the digital divide

214
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,840
well because there's hot girls on the
internet that maybe you could a if they

215
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,510
knew how to use a computer

216
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,750
it's all about mark 3 show on you
noticed a ham-fisted

217
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,410
but seriously there's a whole bunch more
people that you could be interacting

218
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,130
with you could help you solve your
problems

219
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,750
whatever your problem it's this is my
assessment of what the problem was

220
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,770
South by Southwest

221
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,670
it went fine it went fine on so I'm
people all

222
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,959
don't really have broadband options and
so we're talking about money

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,840
again really right you wanna make money
selling year SEO douchebag stuff to

224
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,990
people in my town you can't do it till
they get on the internet

225
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,470
I'm talking about crime and real quick
this is like my heavy slide

226
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,620
on 35 percent for people in the US don't
have broadband

227
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,220
35 percent that's huge it's huge it's
huge

228
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,020
35 percent huge I 20 percent of
Americans don't use the internet

229
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,829
at all tanking first

230
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,950
like I don't use the internet when I'm
sleeping and like

231
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,730
that's it rate I don't take on into the
shower but I can't think it might be

232
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,540
cool if I could

233
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,670
rate on suit 22 percent of Americans do
not understand the joy

234
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,410
a rolling over in the middle of the
night to Google something because you

235
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,819
had a dream and you're wondering if you
know what

236
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,880
I'm people people really think that the
internet problem is that all

237
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,460
you know it's all people don't know how
to use computers don't die and then our

238
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,170
generation people

239
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,610
knows how to use computers because we're
all smack I'm

240
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,240
is gonna solve the problem and that's
actually not true especially New York

241
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,800
you've got a lot of low-income

242
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,330
specially immigrant populations where
people coming to america

243
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,680
they don't have money they don't get on
the internet and one stay

244
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,860
learn the stuff they migrate out up
those

245
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,680
are sort of low bandwith I populations
and are replaced by new people and

246
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,040
there's this constant churn

247
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,900
of low-level tech literacy that never
changes

248
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,960
at least where I live in rural vermont
it is like older people are

249
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,780
dying often replaced by kids to learn at
least a little bit about computers

250
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,390
in school I'm and one of the things
we're doing is the people who are

251
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,069
offline

252
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,340
see my slide I don't have to read it to
you can read

253
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,560
I'm its I people who didn't get high
school

254
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,010
its I Hispanic people its broke people

255
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,080
its I older people yes and its rural
people

256
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,210
no surprise really but one of the things
we're finding is

257
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,650
it's also the people who don't have
broadband also the people who are doing

258
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,810
less online

259
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,840
in the first place you know disabled
people have less access to broadband

260
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,880
even when they get online they're doing
less that's kinda

261
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,970
everybody's like what about your cell
phone you got UPPP than it does the P

262
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,400
stuff in the thing and that's great

263
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,450
if you have cell service where you live
Anna we only can you do

264
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,529
so that's a me right politicians make us
a lot of promises a point to farmer Bob

265
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,230
and they're like we're getting them on
the internet

266
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,279
I'm like when cuz he's not online right
now and it's

267
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,010
sound on burr looking at

268
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,189
berle stuff like I said this what you
got New York

269
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,380
this is the broadband penetration and
this is like new york city households

270
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,260
how I this is who had broadband in 2006

271
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,529
this is how many people they think will
have it by 2012

272
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,500
which as you know it's not now it's
later and they're still showing that

273
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,630
twenty percent two years from now

274
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,790
so urban areas you get the chance like
I've said you also get a lot of people

275
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,980
living in your

276
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,410
can in on New York City Housing
Authority

277
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,000
house where you find on

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,230
many poor people abroad than 25 percent
of people that live in public housing

279
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,450
in New York and broadband and the
structure 5 percent of people in public

280
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,270
housing for over 65 years

281
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,230
page and you know the kind electricity

282
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,279
there in public housing and yet for some
reason broadband access is not seen as

283
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,810
something these people require it's seen
as something they could pay for family

284
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,950
money you don't

285
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,700
so I am living on this is another tiny
library where I live

286
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,580
let's bring it back to libraries are 71
percent leverage the US people US

287
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,850
my recent US reported the only source a
free access to computers and the

288
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,440
Internet in their communities

289
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,620
71 percent its crazy crazy so if you're
broke

290
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,890
you don't like it so this is Washington
Vermont population thousand I was

291
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,250
briefly famous on the Internet when I
went to Washington for Martin installed

292
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,279
Ubuntu

293
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,100
on their computers maybe you saw that
YouTube video that was me

294
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,930
I installing Ubuntu and everyone's like
to cuddle installing an open source

295
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,440
operating system let's lose our minds

296
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,680
and on but very briefly each

297
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,450
I just happen which was cool and then
people like a what happened just might

298
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,990
have to go and I was like wow

299
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,320
library got to force from her husband
and in the basement flooded

300
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,140
and then she lost the root password and
we had to reinstall

301
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,510
and I think they just bought XP at the
end

302
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,100
sad story bunt is really great and I
really wish they'd stayed with it but I

303
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,000
can't leave

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,439
in the library to keep I to keep their
system

305
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,470
now something else you might not know
about libraries

306
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:16,799
is this I we buy the worst software in
the world

307
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,839
and I'll am i right okay

308
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,688
we might were suffering world other than
maybe on

309
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,709
helf insurance people to become lots
mandating the stuff that they can I

310
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,840
can't sell sell

311
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,918
under the payroll and benefits in the
library whatever likes

312
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,700
expenses is licensing fees for bad
software and terrible interfaces to

313
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,490
proprietary content

314
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,559
sorry on

315
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,678
this is currently available software you
can buy this right now

316
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,110
I'm is just one of 31

317
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,110
seriously this is one issue 1 isn't it
is I think on

318
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,200
whole industries have sprung up I'm
selling something called the discovery

319
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,070
layer

320
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,350
which basically put a nice fight and on
crappy back and software

321
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,719
when you thinking about things you can
do think about the discovery where and

322
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,169
how to tell somebody that you know how
to build

323
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,200
on we I don't know if anybody tried
downloadable audiobooks

324
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,059
lately I'm but overdrive is the worst
product in the world

325
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,620
on it makes people hate content

326
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,000
it makes people hate computers and it
makes people learn all about digital

327
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,230
rights management

328
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,039
and on why it stands between them and
enjoying

329
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,860
anything on supported his problem is
that the people who are buying these

330
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,480
digital products which is my colleagues

331
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,690
I with public money which is yours

332
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,080
I actually I think there's a second step
to the side

333
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,299
on they actually don't even know white

334
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,460
what good this is not my comic this
comic is my favorite comic now I i look

335
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,240
at it every morning

336
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,250
when I get up nice adjustment you've got
to do better us

337
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,630
I'm you don't even know what did
designer awesome looking software looks

338
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,450
like are making big decisions

339
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,270
about e-books million dollars of our
contracts with Tom people who tell them

340
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,270
that this is the future

341
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,090
bucks so we can do better pickens don't
know any better

342
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,418
I'm order like us not just getting a
free Canton to turn to give up on

343
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,130
liberia

344
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,240
to prop are so the trick is to have
people with good ideas

345
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,470
stick around to create and implement Sep
19 is give up on stupid library

346
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,809
for those of you who may not be
following

347
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:26,100
however we've got a whole bunch of
awesome tools really eat this is a

348
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,390
evergreen a 20 pack online public access
catalog its open source the state of

349
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,830
georgia decided to build

350
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,168
their own software because all the other
software products stocked

351
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,200
and they created this every public
library state of Georgia

352
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,669
uses it it's maintained by a local
company in Georgia by Georgia coaters

353
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,100
and that code is open to anybody else
can take it and use it to run down my

354
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,840
break

355
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,080
hatch it's really cool and there's open
source online catalogs like oh hot the

356
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,610
entire

357
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,510
open library project if you've seen it
its online they want a page for every

358
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,650
book really nice color coded open

359
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,830
their flip book product you can run on
your own computer its weak

360
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,928
Firefox has millions ily add-ons you
want to think about something else you

361
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:04,590
can do right

362
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,149
nice add-ons that help your library do
things there are some really nice ones

363
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,070
out there

364
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,389
and OpenOffice which I love on there's a
bachelor's cable into their schedule 12

365
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,210
there's all the flavors of 1x

366
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,890
all of those are you know free like free
free like beer free like

367
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,170
librarians like free like a support
contract

368
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,870
so it's a really great time to be a
librarian and if the library

369
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,340
is selling these ideas people in the
library will buy

370
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,678
them the problem is we're selling people
stuff like overdrive in their learning

371
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,040
to not trust

372
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,870
us and it's a be on show

373
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,590
you know wrapping mostly up actually I'm
I want a great conference

374
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,520
in for my which was called the open
source in education conference

375
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,870
and I saw some school technologist
you're getting up and doing

376
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,190
show-and-tell

377
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,020
and on how to do more with class cuz
Robert great like we're all broke

378
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,059
and it would really be nice to spend a
little less money on some tools that

379
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:58,899
were awesome

380
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,350
and I saw this guy get up and do this
like presentation how he ran the entire

381
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,179
school media system these guys are like
technologists rate you ask them what

382
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,030
their job is really

383
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,928
I'm a technologist say your email to
keep

384
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,740
meet pretty on

385
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,390
he got his whole school media center up
and running with me TV

386
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,880
like like Nick TV is some hot shit and
like he's running it

387
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,640
at the school media center recording
content making it playable

388
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,770
all through the school and the most
important thing she could say to the

389
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,530
principle to the superintendent to the
blob applies

390
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,960
it's okay it's legal is really what's
all the stuff he was doing was

391
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,470
and how great for students and how great
that he could share with all of us

392
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,450
and we could just like put the stuff on
our computers and I run in all of our

393
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,340
schools

394
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,990
that's what we need more of like smart
people being like

395
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,890
it's okay it's legal who are me who uses
words like shocks and then people stop

396
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,840
listening to me

397
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,550
so tried this kind of stuff make Adobe
video about it

398
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,970
10 points extra if your girl and tell
your friends

399
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,929
thing we want to avoid you know the fear
uncertainty and doubt the comes from big

400
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,900
business people who will tell you that
open source is full of irises which

401
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,710
makes absolutely no sense at all

402
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,690
I lack of tech experience from staff
fear of the unknown

403
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,840
and the fear the unknown really big deal
is it means we stick with what we know

404
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,240
even if we hate

405
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,470
and match where the digital divide
hacker culture

406
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,800
fight because one of the things about
wanting to mess with things

407
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,130
is being able to explore something new
look at something

408
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,010
badan se maybe we can improve this and
especially the operating systems

409
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,010
that we love to hate and the ones that
we get fat grants for from

410
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,860
takes technology foundation and since
we're in the freidy only free internet

411
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,850
game in town were creating this culture
to pass on to the people that are

412
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,190
learning how to do these tools

413
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,900
and still tweaking even being able to do
this low-level staff require some level

414
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,610
tech literacy

415
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,450
even if it's just to say we'll try this
and we have to be willing to mess around

416
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,880
guests on this one AP was like how you
can pay us to put our content we have

417
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,200
this

418
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,940
crazy nonsense being if you want to get
people to the point where they

419
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,770
understand the necessity of the freedom
to mess around with stuff

420
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,500
freedom to take care to quote one of my
favorite blogs to challenge Dr am

421
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,780
to buy smarter software to create our
own tools to pass the culture on

422
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,610
on you know I've given you a couple what
not to do ideas own this is kinda great

423
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,200
to set feed into the better

424
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,440
comic sensation was bullshit is really
my favorite part of this whole thing

425
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,900
I'm I'm really sorry about to eat a dick
health attica I really was hoping to

426
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,549
keep this a family show

427
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:43,990
on you can come back to this later

428
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,410
I'm I here's my use my bullet point
slides

429
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,710
for the end and then I'm gonna I'm gonna
pass it on but the difference between

430
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,460
making something looks simple and
telling somebody it's easy

431
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,059
is really world apart I don't use the
word easy anymore even though we've got

432
00:23:59,059 --> 00:23:59,629
those stupid

433
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,650
that was easy buttons that we get for
free from Staples because it makes

434
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,500
people feel they're stupid if they can't
figure it out

435
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,700
encouraging people to get involved in
open source software

436
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,480
accepting that it's maybe not going to
be the perfect solution but the

437
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,179
twenty-percent broken one way need
better than 20 percent broken

438
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,270
the Microsoft Vista Way maybe

439
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,290
on but understanding the entire system
and this is my last bullet point I felt

440
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,110
like I needed to explain

441
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,670
on enjoying yourself obviously and not
brushing your teeth

442
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,840
about you guys but we've got some open
source fanatics in my town who show up

443
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,939
at the library in our kind of like big

444
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,520
sweaty a little smelly and they stand a
little too close to you in a holler

445
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,010
and unfortunately they've lost the war
before they started the battle because

446
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,799
the librarians who were known for being
a little bit more standoffish in

447
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,280
whatever

448
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,700
can a freak out and so you know being
somebody who can be like look I'm gonna

449
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,100
walk the talk and high

450
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,179
thank you pleased to meet you you know
even know

451
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,110
in a lot of cases it's just this weird
etiquette Danskin really helped

452
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,160
people except your subversive message

453
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,150
brushing your teeth is really important
surprise surprise and you know it's good

454
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,100
for your gums later in life

455
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,020
so figuring out how to make genuine
options for people include how to help

456
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,549
them solve problems

457
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:17,020
how to give genuine options meaning
stuff that solves a problem for them not

458
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,059
stuff it solves a problem for you

459
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,230
helping them feel confident not stupid
and

460
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,809
on supported generally speaking and so
you know summary

461
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,270
more EA's fewer you're doing it wrong
and then

462
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,620
she's gonna talk about some stuff
specifically know what we're doing in

463
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,520
schools

464
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,520
thanks

465
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,640
sure

466
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:03,059
suck axis

467
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,300
act

468
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,930
space

469
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,780
should

470
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,270
works

471
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:25,270
well it's impossible to see anyone so
I'm gonna be

472
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,700
doing the best I can talk you into the
dark here

473
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,870
up guess given the impossible task of
trying to explain schools to you all

474
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,210
I know some love you want to be more
involved something you probably are

475
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,840
involved

476
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,820
but one of the things that's really
important dont understand is how hard it

477
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,159
is for school folk to do technology

478
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,670
so I thought I'd talk a little bit about
some the constraints sent

479
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,280
those of us who were committed to doing
schools and committed to making the

480
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,080
schools a better place for kids playing

481
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,340
gauging them a bit more than we
currently do specially by using

482
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,070
technology

483
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,169
things that we're trying to wrestle with
so that you can understand how you can

484
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,990
help so here's a

485
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,530
aside I'd like to show %uh folks who
were in the schools

486
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,290
because a tend to forget that technology
is really sorry there and taking over

487
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,659
and that the next generation is growing
up with this stuff in their cribs

488
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,090
you know everywhere at the captors I go
to now the research conferences

489
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,850
in the back row the moms are sitting the
kids are no longer playing with toys to

490
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,060
play with the iPhones

491
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,510
it's it's a switch and educators just

492
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,570
maybe I'm thinking about it as much as
we need to be this is a little academic

493
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,290
but I thought it worth sharing

494
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,879
I'm by we have um helping you understand
how hard it has been for educators to

495
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,370
serve figure out where we have been and
where we certainly are

496
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,750
um the Sun my resnick compared nineteen
twenties

497
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,520
knowledge competent performance
instruction learning aptitude

498
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,820
intelligence with

499
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,020
where we are now so if you follow along
under knowledge

500
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,320
back in the day there are very few
sources there was you know one

501
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,790
authoritative text there just a few
people who knew the whole field

502
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:10,370
now everybody you can and must their
multiple sources and there's really not

503
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,790
one authoritative text a lot of people
who are sorted authorities

504
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,930
it used to be bounded in fixed now it's
constantly changing

505
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,430
someone told me that science is to be
sent like p.m. you know back in the day

506
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,340
we put together

507
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,710
maps in the United States sleep in all
the states in science used to be well we

508
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,190
have you know like 47 other states we
just need a couple more and then we'll

509
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,010
really capsized all down

510
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,220
it's no longer perceived as a puzzle
that you have to fill in a few missing

511
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,260
pieces it's changing its evolving

512
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,610
that's a that's something if you're
educator that's difficult

513
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,790
get your head around competent
performance used to be

514
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,649
for just individuals now it's how how do
we distribute that confidence how the

515
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,740
group working together

516
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,130
on used to be if you could repeat the
multiplication table really really fast

517
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,370
you be good but now you're asked to
explain and interpret

518
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,830
those in the skills we need and my
favorite aptitude intelligence

519
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,340
we used to say they're just a few that
are really smart and everybody else well

520
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,450
don't do other things but now we know
that

521
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,340
everybody's capable and we have to
figure out a way to reach everyone it's

522
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,010
a challenge

523
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,520
so there are about four really big

524
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,580
issues for schools one is access if you
don't have

525
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,550
the technology you can't do anything
with technology issues

526
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,970
second the teachers have to be ready to
use it and that's a huge problem

527
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,420
third the administrators have to be
ready to support it

528
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,960
and finally we have to be equitable and
the way we go about

529
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,670
using technology and teaching with and
that's a huge issue

530
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:49,380
and overall there are few really
important and i can text till

531
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,880
up problems one of them is sis

532
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,940
overwhelming testing pressure the No
Child Left Behind law

533
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,340
may testing certain them primary way
that we evaluate schools

534
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,070
high-stakes means that the scores gonna
newspapers people buy and sell their

535
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,850
homes on the basis of those scores

536
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,750
serious and so people end up thinking
about that test

537
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,160
first last and always they may want to
do an interesting project but the kids

538
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,090
in the computers but

539
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,740
if it back in and bring those that test
for up maybe not so much

540
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,020
the budgets have been slashed base
reno's headlines

541
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,250
but I think the really important one is
that educators by and large

542
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,860
are not sure why we should be using
technology they know it's the 21st

543
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,710
century I'm ready

544
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,950
they know they have one at home but how
it's really helpful

545
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,520
in the school classroom it's not so
clear sup

546
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,230
technology access up we don't have
enough systems people in the schools

547
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,910
and the sisters people need to be more
knowledgeable about how to

548
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:49,070
really help educators in terms access
and terms up

549
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,770
I'm getting teachers involved
specifically there's a group of people

550
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,280
that we desperately need a night goes at
the technology specialist

551
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,540
people who can go and work with teachers
and classrooms and get them excited

552
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,470
and support them in a get in trouble and
they've got 32 wrestles kids in

553
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,810
they need to work on a problem but they
also need to keep those kids

554
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,149
occupied and it's that huge issue love

555
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,670
what's in that classroom should we be
havin carts

556
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,760
lot to computer should be having lamps
where everybody gets up and walks over

557
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,879
to 11 sets

558
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,210
or should everybody have three or four
computers in the classroom is another

559
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,950
issue

560
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,400
if you go to any school you'll find any
number of these

561
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,180
configurations and nobody's really sure
what the right answers

562
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,850
um and a couple charts and hit that I
think the interstate

563
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,520
be ratio of that for getting more and
more computers a few

564
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,800
on that I just compared a few things
from this picture

565
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,430
%uh by and what a wonderful book on
equity and technology that I can show

566
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,600
you and

567
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,380
up the 1998 the ratio was 12

568
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,930
point when computers per kid and now in
2005 re

569
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,100
almost at about four computers are for
kids for computers at the upswing

570
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,200
12 I wish right %uh 12 computers back in
1998

571
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,070
and um for computers now but in the poor
communities

572
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,570
where the percent the very last one
percent to consider eligible for

573
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,820
free/reduced lunch

574
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,970
when there's wanna 75 percent

575
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,870
its used to be 1648 is now stand before
so you can see

576
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,890
that that that's getting more equitable
but

577
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,270
I would say con its one thing to have
the computers it's another thing

578
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,540
to think about how they're being used so

579
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,310
won the primary issues is on even if you
have the equipment

580
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,710
what the teacher allows children to do
so

581
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,710
phone talks about the fact that you
we've got three major issues to address

582
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,030
whenever we're talking about new ideas
in schools and I find is so true with

583
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,110
technology

584
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,900
teachers have to believe that this is a
good idea and if they don't see the

585
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,750
reason to do it

586
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,010
and nobody's helping them move along in
those beliefs

587
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,420
changing those beliefs it's going to be
really hard every get them in there

588
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,770
secondly come we have to help them use
those materials that the technology to

589
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,740
up probes also sites really wonderful
tools for kids but we have to help them

590
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,720
do that

591
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,780
and when you have teachers do that guess
what they have to change the way they

592
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,399
usually

593
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,510
do things in the classroom and that's
really the heaviest left

594
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,129
teachers are used to being in from the
class now they have two working groups

595
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,170
they have to have

596
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,630
projects I have to do things differently
and that's really a major shift in terms

597
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,100
the way they go about doing what they're
doing

598
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,250
up in order to do that

599
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,570
we have to get the more comfortable
technology in general

600
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,770
as I said some of them do have most
people to have it home

601
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,760
but they it's one thing to have in your
home it's nothing to be comfortable with

602
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,040
it

603
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,790
in terms of the class I'm we talk a lot
in the work we do the schools about

604
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm introducing project-based learning
which is when you get a big idea

605
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,170
help kids investigated something new for
teachers to

606
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,820
com and also the schools need to be a
little more flexible good luck with that

607
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,040
in terms %uh I'm maybe forty two

608
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,379
minute pureed is not enough to do that
cool thing that you wanted to do with

609
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,420
technology but how do we and on time

610
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,860
how do we get principles recipients to
think about switching it up

611
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,430
and when you start doing technology is
not necessarily going to be certain the

612
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,449
box learning

613
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,540
in a particular content you really need
to think about linking the two sprints

614
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,509
in

615
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,600
going outside those boxes and finally

616
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,759
support is desperately needed Sir David
every level

617
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,740
he chose a class in terms of getting
rewarded for doing this this extra work

618
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,160
administrators also have to be ready we
found this to be one of the major blocks

619
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,469
for us so we get teachers excited and
then they go back to their schools and

620
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,610
they don't get very much support from
their administrators sometime so

621
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,750
we've been putting a lot of work into
working with principals they need to

622
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,690
realize that their instructional leaders

623
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,760
which is when those easy to say hard to
do things they need to know why it's

624
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,540
important for teachers be using
technology and what they should be doing

625
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,610
with that technology they can't

626
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,910
be in the front the classroom I'm they
need to understand how complicated is a

627
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,850
complex it is for teachers to change it
up

628
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,990
but they also need policy support to
move in that direction

629
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,080
so on the stories I like to tell is when
the the

630
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,890
get to work in the classroom teachers
are really high Technologies Inc teacher

631
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,080
and she's got the kids and

632
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,090
in Group right working in there so
preoccupied nobody looks up in the

633
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,630
principal complex in

634
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,870
is looking around the room and a teacher
funny season

635
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,980
because I'm doing the investor to pick
in her

636
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,030
goes over and said

637
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,040
can help you with you you need something
and he said well I came in to do an

638
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,430
observation but

639
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,830
I guess I'll come back when you're
really teaching

640
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,380
really teaching up ice means when she's
in the front

641
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,190
and they're all sitting in there death
so its impact full story I mean I've

642
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,700
I've seen it written but I've it's been
I've been told that story

643
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,210
several times by teachers who have come
up so those two things we need to think

644
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,890
about changing

645
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,069
equity is huge and just was talking
about this it's really important in

646
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,960
schools

647
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,110
on in terms of access in terms a teacher
preparation

648
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:06,180
terms up being free from testing
pressure guess what the urban schools

649
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,109
and a lot more testing pressures then
the school's center

650
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,000
than automatically do pretty well on the
tests so if you're in an urban school

651
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,630
there's

652
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,870
I have you a greater chance that you're
going to spend more time test getting

653
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,950
ready for that test

654
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,439
then if you're in school with the scores
are going to be pretty good anyway

655
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,500
cell planet things I'm very concerned
about

656
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,680
is that I'm technology officer the split
in the roadway technology can be either

657
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,350
used

658
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,470
what I call technology eyes the status
quo

659
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:37,000
more drill more test prep more
everything faster more efficient right

660
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,790
as opposed to using technology really
creative ways to engage kids and what we

661
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,580
know

662
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,340
we know the way the brain works is when
we engage our children around

663
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,630
interesting topics interesting issues

664
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,930
but to do that you have to be free from
someone that testing pressure you have

665
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,529
to be knowledgeable enough about how
technology could and should be used

666
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,200
creatively to try to do that stuff

667
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,520
so all here is a comparison up some

668
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,530
on if kids were being engaged in

669
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,270
simulations applications really
interesting uses a technology

670
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,960
as opposed to drill in practice and you
can see under the simulations and

671
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,740
applications if you're Asian

672
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,320
here almost four times more likely then
if you're african-american

673
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,060
to be you see simulation snappy
applications

674
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,759
and the same um it the absent almost as
a 3-1

675
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,880
with up drill in practice so

676
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,910
Asian 27 percent and black African

677
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,049
52 percent that says a lot about how are
using technology

678
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,480
schools so complex

679
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,440
challenge kids are excited we gotta
catch up with them

680
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,330
but it's not one there's now no one
single factor that's number is a complex

681
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,490
issue

682
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,030
we first need to decide what's important
and get that message across to her

683
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,440
teachers and administrators

684
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,230
policymakers the goalies to be student
understanding

685
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,850
if we can focus on student understanding
infill projects around that

686
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:06,700
and talk about that rather than covering
contact I think will be

687
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,770
on the right Road and we also need to
understand the technology can be used as

688
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,440
a catalyst for

689
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,040
lowering the resistance to change in
general and Lil Wayne resist the

690
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,770
resistance to doing things the way we've
always done it

691
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,560
to think about doing it and a very new
way very creative way

692
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,830
to engage the kids thanks so much

693
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:32,830
life

694
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,390
was great snaps a surveillance
technology in school change class which

695
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,109
if you have especially if you have your
player paying for education credits

696
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,740
classes awesome I'm so I Minister try to
summarize all that night realize that I

697
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,560
also have

698
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,000
an dogle

699
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,230
I realize that I also have one more time
and I wanted to add on

700
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,890
iris just sorta struck by how both on
Justin talked about

701
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,890
how fear of the unknown has a major

702
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,040
thing said it's it's not just a pity
it's actually

703
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,120
fear of getting on a special
specifically looking bad with teachers

704
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,279
especially

705
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,630
in five runs as well you've been trained
to be an expert and so the sudden loss

706
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,130
of that status

707
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,670
is a huge concern and it's something you
have to dress and

708
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,850
be careful about on didn't actually talk
about the fear of legal issues as much

709
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,509
as I as I thought I i'm italian in a
while ago

710
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,230
on all talk about why a second and
saying we need to get

711
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,240
attack what's the internet access like
schools and she's like

712
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,310
what internet access in schools up
basically right those

713
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,450
my not quite that bad is not great
either

714
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,370
and I said so what's what the obstacles
she said well principles are afraid of

715
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,580
being sued

716
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,170
and that's basically it it's not
necessarily individual teachers fear

717
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,330
it's not you know the wiring anything
like that it is that the legal obstacle

718
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,130
if

719
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,770
you know somebody what's the matter
talking about a dinner about somebody

720
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,210
saw something on the internet in

721
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,340
just a non-issue does a public library
annex

722
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,380
to get the Mikes for the other two
speakers AB

723
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,080
i can text it's good now yes I'm oh yeah
I was just one of those like my son saw

724
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,540
something in a

725
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,640
on the YouTube at the public library and
now he needs weeks intensive therapy

726
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,299
yeah so that its was all the time and
ivory because we actually do provide the

727
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,570
public Internet access the live these
kids don't get or don't learn how to use

728
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,370
in school if you haven't seen what goes
on with video in schools they have

729
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,660
TeacherTube

730
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,870
don't go on its it's really tragically
that they did just the

731
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,540
the screw up your aspect ratio on your
video there's no sort of support for

732
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,210
community or anything they're like

733
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,190
DD pathos of comments on YouTube is
actually preferable teacher cuban want

734
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,670
to waste

735
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,680
might actually learn something from
debating with that guy who wants to

736
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,180
insist that Barack Obama socialist so

737
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm TX is a couple fucks a Texas thing
said they're actually teachers name on

738
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,910
the site

739
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,850
I'm although each you do get a lot of
like my show is actually got it on a few

740
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,690
schools israel also has more than has on
YouTube

741
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,710
but continuously at release user are a
big concern

742
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,000
on the after breaking it also I'm which
means a lot more if you're in a place

743
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,200
where you can't buy

744
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,980
a second iPhone or something like that
so you know she comes

745
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,380
provide ways for people to break
something that's not there on a BF for

746
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,170
example my knees at the library

747
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,550
come break oliver yes and I don't know
if it was you or

748
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,160
air and Erica my roommate said that she
knows one person who did to demonstrate

749
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,819
how hard just break a computer

750
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,950
first thing she does is put the keyboard
down on the chair and

751
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:35,320
sit on a whole bunch time she's not only
twenty well mostly text

752
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,120
not that I think we both do that yes it
is its

753
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,720
yeah you know so so its demonstrations
like a decent keyboard looks computers

754
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,250
still photos on a garbage man screaming
its okay

755
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,770
an FBI agent going going back to

756
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:52,470
the question brushing your teeth again
assume a night here was talking about

757
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,260
how this user interface issue and I
thought that was a great way of putting

758
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,610
it

759
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,910
on but of course I know a lot of
programmers

760
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,890
haven't worked on you I don't really
care about you I in the considered

761
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,779
somebody else's business and they don't
think about it cuz its fuzzy and there's

762
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,090
no science behind it

763
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,440
well that's fine somebody needs to be
doing it so if you don't wanna go to

764
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,680
local haberdasher and get yourself all
kitted out

765
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,009
have your friend do it free some on not
have a nationalist

766
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,720
brush teeth on anyway so the last thing
I wanted to say and the reason I was

767
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,240
talking to Alan about on

768
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,280
getting I kids online in schools is

769
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,960
one thing I really found my dissertation
a huge divide between

770
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,690
when I called natives are strangers
natives being the bloggers and readers

771
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,700
and strangers being the people coming
and saying

772
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,690
your maury povich I need you to find my
baby daddy I'm

773
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,180
the big difference was URL use so the
natives were going

774
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,450
why are you here look up the top of the
page do you see it says elsewhere dont

775
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,840
work this is not maury povich is web
page can you see that

776
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,150
I'm and then if you look through what
the strangers were saying

777
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,730
they clearly didn't see it for a number
of reasons they were trying to make

778
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,790
sense using the URL if they're doing on

779
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,480
if you give me the URL box on a blog
comment form which everybody did

780
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,640
on you would get responses as varied as
their geographic location

781
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,859
their name again even though the spirit
and the four other e-mail address again

782
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,100
even though that's been

783
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,000
on the subject line what they thought
their writing about or just outright the

784
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,740
comment I don't know what this is

785
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,860
writer question mark so URL is not a
term or an idea that

786
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,830
is highs something these people crashed
and I'm now really eager to get more

787
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,770
people to understand your else

788
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:28,240
and I was talking Yahoo to somebody the
other day and showing a job talk there

789
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,920
and adisq I was saying to me oh well you
know

790
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,420
we're not really gonna have to be to
obscure URL's nobody needs a lot of

791
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,150
garbage in it does make me says people
don't like it I was like

792
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,950
you work in the tech industry it's your
job to say whether it goes

793
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,910
for it stays and he said all is the guys
down the street at Apple I was like yeah

794
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,770
I know your Yahoo but like

795
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,310
on I just sounds like it that's not
being recorded right

796
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,090
I'm anyway so %uh but

797
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,610
its if you're if you're in a place to
start thinking about whether you are

798
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,130
anxious and technology think it this way

799
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,030
the Internet can be TV or it can be the
Internet

800
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,920
when you're watching TV you don't know
that Rupert Murdoch is behind

801
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,430
but if you have the URL you can take it
internet put it in there you can teach

802
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,549
your friends how to put in there and do

803
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,060
something at least gives you a little
bit information right quick about who

804
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,770
owns the website and so what the biases
might be

805
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,870
on you know who else is connected to and
things like that phone number

806
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,920
you get her phone number um sold

807
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,680
yet so I'm on a big URL kick these days
I hope I can commit you know it to put

808
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,049
aside from that these panels

809
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,920
about issues like this always attract a
lot of great discussions are likely to

810
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,030
bring lights up and get some comments
and discussion

811
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,550
because I know a lot of people in this
room care about getting stuff into

812
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,100
schools libraries

813
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,210
AB thank you so much three and if you're
if you have questions please contact

814
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:50,720

life follow your blog for years so

818
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:04,240
been a pleasure I'm having been a tech
guy

819
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,920
in a library and also a teacher I know
exactly the pains you've gone through

820
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,110
so 22 comments in an A Question one

821
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:17,310
I would think that just about everyone
in this room you made the comment about

822
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,730
kids growing up with computers I think
everyone in this room grew up with the

823
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:22,420
computer

824
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,760
show of hands yep

825
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,250
just because rest couple for

826
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,310
sorry sorry grandpa

827
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:37,420
I think at the campsite

828
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,070
so just because the rest the Society's
finally catching on to this weird techie

829
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,440
internet web thing there there's other
people after does also

830
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,190
bridge that gap so being an IT guy in
the library

831
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,800
I know exactly the game's over now I'll
ask and everything

832
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,650
your delivery used to where and a
government facility

833
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:03,000
and I secret government is no

834
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,190
night and missus is he doing any word on
how much past life you can talk with

835
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,120
another time

836
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,400
I am I tried to get another job

837
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,470
working I T in a library and couldn't

838
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,230
unfortunately the librarians have done
it to yourselves

839
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,770
in regards to requiring a Masters of
library science from most

840
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,700
position it's a huge problem interpret
how actually can you guys

841
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,640
get that change so the rest the folks in
this room that loves working in the

842
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,710
library

843
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,050
or would love that kik opportunity
working in a library

844
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,870
be able to do that question

845
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:45,270
idealistic great suggestion greedy I
mean the whole reason I get to get paid

846
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,170
eight dollars an hour to work at my
library up the street is because

847
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,000
I have this useless master's degree and

848
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,330
which I love but you know I think I
wanna change cast actually come from

849
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,020
other librarians who are a techie work
odors marked

850
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:08,180
I'm basically being like the things you
learn in the library world

851
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,190
%uh in library school aren't necessarily

852
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:16,630
the same skill set in fact in many ways
their complementary skill sets but not

853
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,910
overlapping with a lot of what sort of

854
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,290
technique older people bring up and I
know that like there's some places that

855
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,370
are really hung up on the master's
degree

856
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,710
but I found it for a lot of places I
mean granted I'm unserved rural America

857
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,940
but man if you know your way around
WordPress PHP

858
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,270
you can do sequel queries and you can't
show up

859
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:40,440
and not insult everybody I'm there's a
lot of systems level stuff that you can

860
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,160
do in

861
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,960
larger systems the government may be
actually one more difficult places to

862
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,470
break in but I do agree dislike

863
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:50,630
everybody's responsibility in the
library world actually to kind of D

864
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,320
professionalize our professional degree
in some way to be able to have people

865
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,270
with other professional expertise

866
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,170
come in and share the workload rate its
weird arbitrary hurdle and I would

867
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,700
totally agree with you that there's

868
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,480
no reason to sort of hold it up for
people who aren't gonna be

869
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,650
doing the chops required on just turned

870
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,380
for if for the commoners committed to
one question is terminal interest time

871
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,420
and I think you're next

872
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:22,890
much yeah now we are not a must know if
area Greg saying five ministries

873
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,359
okay I I just wanted to speak to the
digital divide

874
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,930
thing and because I Love New York City
now and I hear people say

875
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,279
the digital divide doesn't exist anymore
in their ways they were getting around

876
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,830
it

877
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,230
but I got their own New England and

878
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,420
when you give their broadband

879
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,350
I think we're is a lot at hand out of
people's minds when they're talking

880
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,839
about rural areas is that

881
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,650
and where my parents used to live are
dial-up internet was so slow I could not

882
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,830
log into squirrelmail

883
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,060
like the phone lines are so all data
infrastructure is so bad in a lot of

884
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,630
rural areas that it's not just a
question

885
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:03,810
do you have broadband it's a question of
how bad is the wiring going to your

886
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,120
house

887
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,490
yeah and should I guess I just

888
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,780
maybe if that ties into schools at all

889
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,280
and generally the quality of computers
in schools and will that become

890
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,880
larger major issue now the reaction
computers there are they going to be

891
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,880
computers that are new enough that
they're actually

892
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,210
using teaching kids how to use and not
just having them

893
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:28,250
so all that they get frustrated give up
because it's like

894
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,600
from the late 90's and it's running like
does

895
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,970
go kill myself with the rock stuff

896
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:40,950
please don't up the whole in a broadband
mapping is a huge

897
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:45,400
issue for New York up but you should
know that people are working on it

898
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,070
others I culture a technology policy and
practice consul for New York

899
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,700
that works at the border regions and
they are there other people

900
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,320
that are working understand they really
appreciate and understand the whole

901
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,200
world issue

902
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,380
that's it's a big big big problem on

903
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,780
story I love are that the issue of all
computers in the schools

904
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,220
it's very real also and there's it's not
gonna find an easy fix because schools

905
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,080
are not

906
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,180
they broke a minute while they're not
broke but that money is not necessarily

907
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,460
being spent on

908
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,580
updating the technology is a first
priority right now

909
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,690
I'm so yeah we have you wouldn't believe
the computers and in some the school's

910
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:29,040
and its also something but is as I was
talking about the matter for policy

911
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,120
makers to prioritize also

912
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,880
and to let people know that they should
be spending their money on this because

913
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,400
it's it may be a better

914
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,730
investment in some other things that
they're doing I've been hassling all is

915
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,130
my candidates for governor

916
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,670
we're having our primary in two or three
weeks and I'm like realistically

917
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:47,250
realistically when you gonna do to help
get field

918
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,300
and you know at least have them know
that like people who know that this

919
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,110
stuff care but

920
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,920
stuff I'm get a reply have time for
maybe one or two more questions i

921
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,810
apologize. out in the hallway in
hallways

922
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,950
I'm suggest I was gonna suggest actually
since we do have a lot of people online

923
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,310
I think that's great on

924
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,620
if there's nobody in Morse over in the
fourth unscheduled track you guys might

925
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,430
sort of just

926
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,280
on the black over there once we're done
here so I think you're next

927
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,620
quick comment quick plug arm if you're
at all interested

928
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,259
in libraries and education um

929
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,340
there are plenty of verse who were here

930
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,490
who were interested in talking to you in
getting your health

931
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,870
%uh it's not just you know there are a
lot of interesting techno

932
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:31,210
technological problems as well on and it

933
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,140
the the speakers a really made a very
compelling K case for why you should be

934
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:35,910
interested

935
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:39,339
but I'm also here to say there's plenty
of complicated

936
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,530
debt problems and interesting ones as
well marks get a real job

937
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,730
unlike me and he often tries to deal
with really complicated techie issues by

938
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,600
having other people helping out with
them and

939
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,110
right attacking to in addition to some
the other library people around here

LA be alright Akhil get one

950
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,040
just gonna get one more comment from
leaving I just wanted to say I am one of

951
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,080
those people getting

952
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,299
wanted those useless library science
degree is Prato

953
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,150
yeah not be practical Pratt yeah I know
called the school stuff going on craft

954
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,160
yet no no its not to leave but I just I
just had a quick question

955
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,359
I just interned recently in a public
library I

956
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,760
that was doing its best to provide
technology education

957
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,890
in class formats but it was really clear
that if

958
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,200
that was not serving the needy people
people are not showing up for the

959
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,270
classes but clearly needed help

960
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:06,420
and I was running if you had the same
problem with people self

961
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,310
identifying are not self-identify as
people who were in need

962
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:14,509
police biggest serve a triage mentality
we often don't offer classes in the

963
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,340
public library but we have to have this
like intake

964
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:21,320
thing when people come in to try and
figure out what they have

965
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,550
I've actually just finished reading a
book about the digital divide in doing

966
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,230
that exact same stuff how you talk to
people it's called without a net lybrand

967
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:29,940
bridging the digital divide whatever

968
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,490
but one of the things is how you assess
those people who are coming in

969
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:37,170
figuring out what the need figuring out
how to serve them a lot of times we

970
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,780
found that pairing up

971
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,210
key to want to get to hang out in the
computer room a lot

972
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,510
at the same time as they can help answer
questions

973
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,210
for people sitting around I do this
thing in my school called drop in time

974
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:52,950
where I sit in a giant laugh love
computers and broadband

975
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:56,150
and just hang out there for hours a week
and people show up

976
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:00,420
and we have wifi and I bring my iPhone
and I let people touch it

977
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,630
and you know I have my camera and
literally people can come in and ask

978
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,700
questions

979
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,730
but if they don't ask questions I don't
talk I just

980
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:11,000
around check my email so you know they
have to come to the table with an

981
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,400
information need

982
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,020
not just like show me how this stuff
works cuz I'm like I don't know what you

983
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,259
want to do with it

984
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,130
but it's really hard to each community
has to figure out

985
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:25,400
how to best I you know interact with the
people that are coming

986
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,620
eating stuff I'm really sorry wanna be
respectful the people that are coming in

987
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,480
hacks cross

988
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,350
so can you too close thank you all so
much for coming I'm always so happy to

989
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:32,779
see how many people
