1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,740
school like say some things that people
do here wouldn't let that are now

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,870
resulting in students being expelled

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,950
being fined tens of thousands of dollars
and

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,070
and the peanut butter knife okay

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,310
I don't know I I really

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,349
answers in that sense other than to

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,270
absolutely agree that people have lost
their minds they've lost their bowls

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,810
you know I mean

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,259
in in the Marine Corps we have
non-judicial punishment

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,429
we have non-commissioned officers
punishment each one is a step down from

11
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:41,929
really serious punishment we've lost

12
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:46,010
we've really lost yes sir

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,039
so a how do we find it well we found
here a lot of us are maybe a little bit

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,710
maybe house college some others are in
jobs

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,719
I hate to keep going back to a few weeks
but we have jobs that

16
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,729
and may be exposed as information but
how do we fit into your

17
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,009
vision its for stuff

18
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,869
not my vision or a vision yeah I mean
tear

19
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,210
here tell Hardy shirt on the idea spear

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,079
HG Wells world Bri there's

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,700
number books I've reviewed world mind

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,590
global mind Howard global brain

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,170
I think what's happening here is that
information

24
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,250
communications technology is

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,539
leading to the ability to connect human
brains

26
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,950
but we haven't matured or social skills
I certainly haven't

27
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,950
and we haven't learned how to manage
ourselves it's almost like

28
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:54,429
like the human that is being given this

29
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,320
transformer uniform or whatever but we
have to learn how to use it

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,340
okay so I mean

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,380
if you look at how people using
cellphones

32
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,649
it's like to increase idiocy up

33
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,400
i mean i i really if I had the money I'd
buy one of those jammers it's good for

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,519
100 feet around

35
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,800
and I would just drive around with it
you know

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,159
make yes in

37
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,329
restaurants would not be fun

38
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,519
let me find that would be a fun hack is
just everybody go out with the phone it

39
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,599
close to the city

40
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,980
but the fact is the sponsor

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,179
argues for a Valley Girl bullshit when
in fact they could be used for

42
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,129
geospatial coordination

43
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,170
weather testing biochemical sensing

44
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,400
linking up

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,530
this some what we could do so

46
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,500
were WAY WAY behind and this is because
the engineers haven't been talking to

47
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,450
the humanities

48
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,080
just like the computer was invented
without a clue as to what people would

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,140
actually do with

50
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,670
you know i i I fought my wife on this
with my kids grow up

51
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,230
grand theft auto and they're better for

52
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,019
a min amen yes sir Cardiff

53
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,739
actually they didn't learn how to check
carpet they learn how to think and

54
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,489
service

55
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,420
and press triangle I

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,790
up and laughing because I know that
supposed to be fun am actually clueless

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,780
I guy I just wanted to say one thing
which

58
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,250
I mean I've been here not necessarily
since

59
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,340
midnight but long enough getting you
know near the end of my rope

60
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,760
you said that cell phones are bringing

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,129
idiocy I don't know if you're talking
about Americans as I told you before I'm

62
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,890
not an American so maybe all have like a
brain defect

63
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,930
you also told me that okay okay I'm
sorry I'm really sorry and Canadian um

64
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,719
but you've also said that cell phones in
North Korea are

65
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,250
kinda placating them you're also set up
placating them revolutionizing

66
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,040
okay cellphones are being used to access
information that sensor

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,029
on because cell phones or 11 channel
right hand

68
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,229
unless you jam them all you actually let
information through

69
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,820
and networks is turning 24

70
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,009
thanks okay

71
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:34,919
just go back to that that's also a key
factor right here

72
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,729
because and him over there

73
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,860
maybe a suspected terrorist I've no idea
but now we're all in the same room with

74
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,009
him for six hours

75
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,780
and now we're all possibly under a watch
list

76
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,850
because we've been in the room with him
back in

77
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,380
for six hours to you call it good

78
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,460
Yorkshire aa actually he's a vet and
recover

79
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,940
when I had a that makes me no difference
being than having this offer track that

80
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,880
the fact that we're all still here

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,199
12 hours later than when you started I
think it is highly suspicious that

82
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,199
you'll stay

83
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,099
I hip

84
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,639
on I think I'm where you guys down I
don't think you're gonna last best 6:30

85
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,569
by of

86
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,060
I had a head downstairs to free beer
myself

87
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,639
and impact they sell beer at this hour
the day up

88
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,569
it was borrowed okay so on in passing
overheard a conversation

89
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,900
on about someone talking about operation
condor

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,350
could you just go into a little bit on D
Tom and explain why I don't remember the

91
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,050
operation

92
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,780
really know anything about it so you're
better off

93
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,020
googling for signed I need to go to
Wikipedia well depends I mean you know I

94
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,289
really to be Wales is a brilliant
brilliant man

95
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:10,380
but when I appeal to him

96
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:17,380
to stop the destruction of the open
source intelligence pages plenty of

97
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,698
I mean Wikipedia is a phenomenally

98
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,669
powerful instrument but

99
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,789
their sisters there's a

100
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,500
there's a destructiveness when people
get it editing

101
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,810
wars and we haven't figured out how to
handle that

102
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,380
and Wikipedia hasn't figured out how to
give people like me

103
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,289
karma points were actually knowing what
you're talking about

104
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:50,759
on open source intelligence I mean I was
I spent five days

105
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,050
working up the open source intelligence
page in

106
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,530
a journalist who is now dead and the CIA
group became an interest destroyed my

107
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,479
work

108
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,740
and then when I went back and fixed it
they banned me

109
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,370
okay soul

110
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,360
sisters one issues there I ball you know
weepies kind of a double-edged sword I i

111
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,330
did.

112
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,960
a friend of mine does a lot of web
development for a Republican web sites

113
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,190
and

114
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,620
a a pastime urges was actually inventing

115
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,310
political positions in a New Jersey

116
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,639
yeah and then invent basically creating
fake buyers for them and then

117
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,120
texting scandals for them get mad I

118
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,810
and I love it and then anyone who

119
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,349
removed or edited one of the pages that
he did

120
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,650
he he created he would just say that it
was vandalism and put it back up

121
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,810
n if the page had been there for more
than six months

122
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,370
it took ligaments man effort for someone
to prove that

123
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,180
the person he created in scandals that
he invented didn't exist

124
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,720
that's actually the beginning have an
absolutely fascinating topic

125
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,190
I could go on for about two hours on
biggest no not really I think this is

126
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,259
really cool

127
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,000
because it's the whole issue love peer
validation

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,229
and I forget what I was looking at that

129
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,930
there was this answer site for one
specific thing

130
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,379
where people would accumulate karma
points for being

131
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:22,960
right with yeah well as Slashdot but
there's others

132
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,289
and what we don't have is kinda Slashdot
for everything

133
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,030
I and yeah that's good and and the other
thing we don't have

134
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:37,150
is a way of harnessing the energy of
both the published in the unpublished

135
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,199
on because I found in my own experience
that

136
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,030
the top 100 people who are published are
not the top 100 people actually have

137
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,730
their hands dirty

138
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,050
you have to get both of them into the

139
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,310
into the discussion I think the whole
idea of how do you

140
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,870
how do you self correct and had self

141
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,050
validate as a group is absolutely
fascinating to me and I don't have any

142
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,959
answers but it's something I would love
to hear others talk about

143
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,820
like as far as Wikipedia concern seems
like it went from the winners

144
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,680
riding history to those who go
unchallenged

145
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,070
rate history and new that really sorry

146
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,850
that's a quote those who go unchallenged
rate history

147
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,170
its interest weighty

148
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,510
my last name stop if you want with an
ebook

149
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,600
lleno I'm not allowed to write books
anymore

150
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,260
for the time being anyway his way to
have you here some spy stories

151
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,470
sure a

152
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,130
for good well yeah I mean does anyone
remember with the most important skill

153
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,100
spying is

154
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,450
you well listening is good typing is the
answer

155
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,700
four hours a typing for every hour aged
meeting

156
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,040
and if you doing it tears meeting you
have to record it then you have to take

157
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,380
the transcript yourself so eight hours

158
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,570
typing is absolutely essential

159
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:18,550
CIA hasn't discovered voice recognition

160
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,410
huge

161
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,420
up here

162
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,459
coolest thing I ever did was get a list
to the senators that were considered to

163
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,670
be supporting a ser

164
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,680
tonight area power that went to reagan
personally

165
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,660
years only

166
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,400
scared to stay ever was had someone
else's diplomatic pouch in the back of

167
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,170
my car

168
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,890
police stopped me two in the morning but
I had broken the rules

169
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,510
kept my diplomatic identities

170
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,689
was little saving grace

171
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,130
most drinks in one day think

172
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,420
10 that was in part because I had two
lunches with three drinks each

173
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,160
on the same day to different people

174
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,709
for 5

175
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,350
well then I had drinks in the afternoon
in the evening reception or whatever but

176
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,500
I actually had to

177
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,920
complete lunches with to different
people on the same day

178
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,030
no but I have seen russians spit red
wine on the state

179
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,650
you know it's it's it's this KGB thing
we both

180
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,810
with red wine in this is supposed to
like flavor the state

181
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,850
you know can't get over the fact that
their saliva

182
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:47,850
has been burned off yes sir

183
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,010
I I can't hear you so let's go to the
guys in the microphone

184
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,300
guys in the microphone year

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,570
a sela tear

186
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,339
if you would like me me I'm somebody was
a

187
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,339
said do maybe if given up more
information WikiLeaks and

188
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,839
and is now possibly in prison

189
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,550
but they had diplomatic pouches possibly
are access a diplomatic

190
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,770
here that guy transferred that guy
whoever it may or may not be

191
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,850
and what the

192
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,360
able make are into what's the problem

193
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,810
are that the wrong said I'm in with

194
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,680
yeah mooted a bouquet I

195
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
yet thank you a

196
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,580
station to station information getting
out sell between

197
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,750
Middle East and an american let's say
get well

198
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,700
I think where we're getting into
interesting around here

199
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,990
because what you're really doing is is
your balancing

200
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,020
the right of the public to know that its
government is evil

201
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,160
versus the right to the government to
keep its evil secret and for me it's a

202
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,930
no brainer

203
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,550
i winner on the right of the public to
know but

204
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,400
right now the government is earning on
the side

205
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,070
enforcing secrecy rules that apply to
stuff that shouldn't be secret

206
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,600
sold if I were defending that geyer
fiery defending the two people that just

207
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
got sent to jail for telling the cubans
with the US was planning

208
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,190
I would her on the side

209
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,430
holding the government to a higher
standard of behavior

210
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,959
with respect to anything it's revealed

211
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,580
but sent like

212
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,600
week I'm clueless

213
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,810
we go okay gonna leaks yeah

214
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,160
well you know i mean WikiLeaks s to be
responsible also

215
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,140
I mean they favor alienated some people
basically just

216
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,250
going in and exposing some corporate
stuff that

217
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,750
really was not there's to expose did

218
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,490
really reveal anything that was

219
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,530
illegally was just it was

220
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,870
was like stealing a car to joyride

221
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,740
okay rather actually having a serious
purpose so

222
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,750
if wikiLeaks is pissed off Steve
Aftergood WikiLeaks things to worry

223
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,450
about that

224
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,290
because i text even after very seriously

225
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,270
he's the a primary force behind
Federation of American scientists and

226
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,069
publishes the secrecy news

227
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,140
which is a very high value

228
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,620
commentary on excessive secrecy

229
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,220
government their

230
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,560
accept that you have to go one you go

231
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,850
Google for WikiLeaks Steven Aftergood

232
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,360
and see what he said about it I
questioned him on it because I was

233
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,230
surprised

234
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,050
I knew that we had Julian is a keynote
speaker and he gave me a very balanced

235
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,050
account of why he was upset with
WikiLeaks

236
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,430
and so on just saying just like Jimmy
Wales needs to listen to me when I

237
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,190
complain

238
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,279
WikiLeaks the explicit Steven Aftergood
would he complains

239
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,640
okay so I'm not sure I speak for
everyone

240
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,760
personally I'm not a spy and I've
conference wondered

241
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,209
what spice sex is like and I'll

242
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:31,360
but could all I does like what I seem
two games behind like

243
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,990
so do spots but success

244
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,320
and now to feel spies

245
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,329
how was fixin kill people their rights
figures

246
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:46,670
I should be so naive here

247
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,270
I was gonna ask the exact same question
except for the fact that maybe could

248
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,319
outline like the typical day I mean to
use your %uh

249
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,640
do exit on 280 in sweat to death hoping
for your contact to show off

250
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,670
30 maybe like you know go all the way
once up to a typical day but first let

251
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,850
me answer the sex

252
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,940
question %uh here it depends on your age

253
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,180
it's generally very sweaty very drunken
and very be still

254
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,550
and it only happens like once a month

255
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,790
because the rest attack near Taipei a

256
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,430
yeah yeah

257
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,600
and and and I have to say that there's a
double standard

258
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,190
because the boy spies are allowed to
fuck around as much as they want to

259
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,430
spend the government's money

260
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,350
seducing women the girl spies are
supposed to be very chaste

261
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:43,170
held to a higher standard so basically
see a treat women like shit

262
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,350
and jeanine brookner Road a good book

263
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,699
litigating against secrecy

264
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:55,500
was my deputy chief station overseas

265
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,870
she was basically discriminated against
for doing what boys do

266
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,439
she won a lawsuit that pay their way
through Harvard Law or whatever

267
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,270
I'm glad for she's a very good person
and

268
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,449
basically CIA's outta control

269
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,280
they use fitness for duty physicals to
pressure people

270
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,520
and their management in the deal the
TI's

271
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,000
essentially on ethical and

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,560
by and large it's a fun place to be for
a while

273
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,850
wanna live there

274
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,240
Oso typical day let me do the typical
guys this goes on the first part is

275
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,490
is the sex martial arts in any way with
other spots

276
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,900
no we we we like our women totally
placid

277
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,350
the yeah

278
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,030
warm plastic okay

279
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,360
now now now now absolutely not I mean

280
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,710
if you have to fight you failed

281
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,260
up so a in the a

282
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,480
you know community aged 38 I we spend a
hundred thousand dollars a month

283
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:12,480
benefit gunnysacks in part because I had
ethics

284
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,750
I wasn't doing it wrong I was on

285
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,929
no actually we rode the bus

286
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:26,620
you know women

287
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,080
I've never been there

288
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,550
and now you know what I mean spying is a
bureaucracy

289
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,158
and spying from an official installation
is idiocy

290
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,610
biggest everybody knows who you are

291
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,110
all you have to do is keep an eye out
for anybody who works

292
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,679
more than nine to five if you catch the

293
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,090
chief stations party you've got the
entire station plus all the

294
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,168
communicators

295
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,060
and maybe the Knox non-official cover
officers

296
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,360
the inside officers are slobs they will
read liaison to the non-official covers

297
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,390
in a heartbeat

298
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,080
yeah it's just it's bullshit really is
who are now a typical day

299
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,428
I was unusual I worked 80 hour weeks
most guys work 60 hour weeks

300
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,530
but I would start my morning with coffee
and maybe a brush pass

301
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,678
and maybe a colon do a quick our meeting

302
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,890
going to type it up and I one due to
develop else over lunch

303
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,870
maybe have an afternoon meeting at a
hotel room or another safe site or

304
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,040
whatever

305
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,178
somewhere in there I might take some
photos for dead drop site

306
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,320
then in the evening developmental
cocktails in a late-night meeting

307
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,260
with a particular I it was worth needed
one or two hours at the briefing

308
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,500
said generally I slept from troll 26

309
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,400
11 26 something like that shows a full
day

310
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,740
so so what category exactly as
developmental cocktails

311
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,940
well write that off sometime on

312
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,169
a developmental is someone who you think
has potential

313
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:12,360
your your leadership has approved as
having potential

314
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,260
and therefore you're allowed a certain
amount a latitude in terms of

315
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,280
entertaining them

316
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,379
and cultivating them I mean you know we
do

317
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,679
socal chance encounters like where if I
think you really important run my card

318
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,290
yours just so I can get it fixed and
develop a relationship with you

319
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,639
in the I was gonna ask you would you
have to develop bombers leaves a relief

320
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,580
aid to you

321
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,879
learning 50/50 nobody feat do anything
in fact

322
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,300
a lot of people make up cases and

323
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,899
pretend to have recruited people who
haven't actually been recruited

324
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:49,320
deal bill fabricate stories

325
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,270
I was recruiting five people here for
five six years straight

326
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,629
25-26 recruitment left after three tours

327
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,940
that's almost unheard of most people are
lucky

328
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,000
wanted to recruitment tour

329
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,090
but but its

330
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,379
you know it's unfortunate because
station has what's called an objective

331
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,649
memorandum

332
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,970
which is what you're supposed to be
doing and nobody

333
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,740
REITs that what they do is they
basically the down the street throwing

334
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,169
money

335
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:25,020
the air and than anybody who grabs a
dollar bill or your nation

336
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,300
now so the right it up fun

337
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,330
nobody reads the newspapers probably
nobody reads

338
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,350
newspaper so a lotta for agents are

339
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,040
are basically recycling stuff you know
this

340
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,810
my cousins cleaning lady in the foreign
ministry

341
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,240
this is what she said they said they're
actually just reading

342
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,780
a local media that the case officers
agreed

343
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,408
and I don't know how it is today but in
my day

344
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:56,929
case officers were way too important to
do reading and training

345
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,310
so we would basically have 0 files slow
burn times

346
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,980
and we would just take stuff at face
value

347
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,200
Sahar your perspective change as as a
new

348
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,790
you know into the field verses perhaps
OSM

349
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,260
how was like you know one to three years
on

350
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,470
I mean sound rude awakening to this yr
do just say

351
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,639
love my man Jeeves Ron ING's

352
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:27,820
fun to drive in action yeah I have a
Walther PPK limited edition

353
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,030
shoots AC p38 K

354
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,740
on I

355
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,710
%ah pink

356
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,389
alright I won't do that again at Franks

357
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:50,820
next from goes into the crowd FAP

358
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,270
who is that guy that had the slide
romantic

359
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,940
%uh Gallagher it's like I'm at a you
would get plastic Taylor

360
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,169
doesn't no no I'm not I'm

361
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:06,460
not you're you're you're safe here

362
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,500
it's okay there's some I'm a
non-threatening short fat balding old

363
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,530
guy okay

364
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,050
so alright on

365
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,050
anyway what was the question arm

366
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,580
all about joão yeah it was a very good
question when I would

367
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:28,480
all school answering a question so when
I first came and I went into a war zone

368
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,919
where the station has been closed and so
we worry activating agents

369
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:38,480
in recruiting new agents in HS shows how
shortsighted CIA is because it close the

370
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,570
whole buncha stations in Africa and we
needed them

371
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,530
it has never played a long game and
plays a short game

372
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,918
and and so I mean I thought I was doing
God's work

373
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,210
and I walked on water I was like a
Jesuit

374
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,550
with the really big balls and a gun and

375
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:05,110
the and I loved it I did three back to
back door switch is extremely unusual

376
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,389
and then I came back to washington and I

377
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:12,169
worked very hard in washington three
jobs here when there was told to go case

378
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,220
of certain other case officer:

379
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,950
and that was code for go down the hall
and go to another

380
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,860
employee if this agency in like cheese
stealing bring me back the answer i won

381
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,520
and I was kinda the end of my contract
with the CIA intellectually emotionally

382
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,780
and then by the grace of God the Marine
Corps came to me because I've been a

383
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,168
reserve intelligence officer all this
time

384
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:37,659
and in offered me the chance to create a
very quick delicious command

385
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:42,139
and ideas and I loved it got a two great
promotion never looked back

386
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:45,810
and effect it's kinda funny because
everyone runs hip pocket operations that

387
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,720
they don't tell CIA about so

388
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,050
when I went over to the CIA the Marine
Corps would tell me about their

389
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,149
clandestine operations because they
thought I'd read them out to the CIA

390
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:59,960
and when I left the CIA went back to the
Marine Corps City 14-7 likely sources

391
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,230
you like a marine corps penetration the
only Division

392
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,620
I you know so it was fun a.m.

393
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,190
but I don't regret a minute I actually
believe that spying is necessary

394
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,260
but it should only be 10 percent the
solution and

395
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,340
it should be done on the cheap anybody
throws money around as a spy in

396
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,820
and should be persona non grata

397
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,110
it really needs to be done responsibly
right now spying is a voice came

398
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,280
anything done out of an official
installation is absolute under

399
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,330
bullshit and

400
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,000
we should have analysts in the secure
spaces in our embassies

401
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,860
they should be doing all source
intelligence and they should be doing

402
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,570
open source intelligence

403
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,780
ship budgets with which to buy legal
ethical information for journalists

404
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,399
I'm gonna take a break I want to go to
the bathroom but then I'm gonna tell you

405
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,179
about my second thesis on three
embassies in the amount of information

406
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:54,630
that they did not collect is that
alright

407
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:01,630
her

408
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,350
here

409
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,929
the Jeep

410
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,190
burrows underwear this

411
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:41,190
hissy yeah okay

412
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,600
3

413
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,600
over

414
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,850
alright the the second graduate thesis

415
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,910
was for public administration I look at
three embassies

416
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,430
basically an embassy the diplomats are
in the minority

417
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,460
and the representational allowance for
diplomats is 50 percent for the

418
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,410
ambassador

419
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,480
fifty percent for the four councillors
and the other 50 percent spread among

420
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,800
the

421
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,809
2230 embassy employees

422
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:16,059
this means that a junior officer
generally at best gets to take someone

423
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,740
out to lunch once a month

424
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,650
and maybe has one small party one
Supporter

425
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,830
the rest to the embassy

426
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,449
consists of apart from whoever's doing

427
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,510
clandestine stuff many individual
representatives have many different

428
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,510
government agencies

429
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,890
agriculture commerce Coast Guard
whatever

430
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:43,559
and so what I found was your average
embassy was severely handicapped because

431
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,600
the people who wanted legitimate
collection

432
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,160
or legitimate open source information
had no money with which to buy

433
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,770
commercial intelligence or pay
journalists for special report anything

434
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,490
like that

435
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,640
they were limited to the physics of a
24-hour day

436
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,630
and who is willing to be seen with them
the spies in contrast

437
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,160
demanded be a traitor before they would
listen to you they have no interest at

438
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,580
all

439
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,909
an open source intelligence or
commercial intelligence that is legally

440
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,950
and ethically available

441
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,980
and so I found the result was when
combined with the fact

442
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,120
had to coordinate your electronic
messages which everyone would see

443
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,050
and you did not have to coordinate your
hard copy out shipments back

444
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,639
what I found was that we collected at
past 20 percent

445
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,320
have the relevant available information
and in the process

446
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,750
sending it back to washington spilled
eighty percent so that basically leaves

447
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,720
us I think with roughly 2 percent

448
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,250
love what it means is if you send hard
copy back

449
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,130
it goes from the embassy to one desk
officer

450
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,660
one agency who doesn't have time to read
it and therefore he just throws it away

451
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,490
or files

452
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:57,390
it doesn't become part of the electronic
common space

453
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,050
okay but I realized

454
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,090
recently that it doesn't matter were
only getting 2 percent at the end 21

455
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,410
intelligence because nobody's making
decisions based on intelligence

456
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,100
making decisions based on ideological a
commercial interests or

457
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,230
whatever so that was the second thesis

458
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,570
any questions I think you guys here
falling down here

459
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,340
I have a question yes sir um you
mentioned earlier

460
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,410
a constitutional convention up

461
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,440
in in this scenario I think there was
with

462
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,700
allow any amendment or any even

463
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,580
destruction of the constitution to occur
is

464
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,010
and I don't believe there's any
mechanism by which to limit the scope of

465
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,420
such

466
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:46,610
cheryl's so I don't feel that we're at
the point yet

467
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,780
such a thing would be necessary I'd
understand the

468
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,940
emotional response to and I doubt
there's any

469
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,210
I doubt the congress Senate would
actually at

470
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,390
amend the Constitution to create clause
for

471
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:04,000
some sort of scope creation by the
state's

472
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,580
for such her statement up

473
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,679
for also for

474
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,360
controversial legislation

475
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,960
that Congress would never past like
something like

476
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,850
recall election mechanisms were

477
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,490
repealing the 17th amendment

478
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,760
how do you think anything like that
could ever

479
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,090
going to affect well I

480
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,130
my understanding is that if enough
States agree to it

481
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,559
congress has no choice but I agree with
you we should have a constitutional

482
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,240
convention at this point but we should
use it to get

483
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,370
electoral reform mean we should use the
threat to the Constitutional Convention

484
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,260
I think a lot a state should start now
will find federal laws

485
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,590
big is the federal government is
creating ceilings rather than force

486
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,270
for responsible legislation such as
environmental

487
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,450
you can't go above this demand whatever

488
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,520
on I E

489
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,239
honestly be very nonviolent by
inclination

490
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,940
think that we're gonna have to have some
kind a swarm

491
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,159
pressure on congress I mean I

492
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,149
read with fascination a story about a
mob around call rose house

493
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,969
where they would chase him around the
house from the outside

494
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:33,159
and knock on the window and it scared
the shit outta

495
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,280
but I'll tell you something every single
congressman is vulnerable to that kinda

496
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,909
swarm pressure

497
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,889
particularly if they can't go out in
public without the swarm appearing

498
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:46,120
and so I think

499
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,850
word point now we're the
dysfunctionality has gotten our

500
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,060
attention

501
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:57,000
and the Tea Party is one manifestation
but it's not sufficient

502
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,250
I certainly would like to see the black
population

503
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,650
much more aggressive about demanding
Obama

504
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,210
he release all the prisoners who are in
fact slaves they're performing

505
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,640
labor for furniture and license plate
another commercial

506
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,940
things getting pennies on the dollar

507
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,420
I really I don't know but I think we're
getting close to where

508
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,780
it will not be possible to be a
congressman in the United States without

509
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,030
being held accountable

510
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,880
may not be five maybe five years maybe
more but I think we're getting to a

511
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,990
point now

512
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,530
where congressman will not be able to do
secret deals where every penny will be

513
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,730
/c

514
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,060
I'd love to see much more whistleblowing

515
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,960
vertically to to free web sites rather

516
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,240
to specific government agencies don't
really seem to investigate as much

517
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,300
yessir

518
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,660
do you care to discuss some have your
elicitation techniques and meet some

519
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,549
basic things

520
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,510
with us would you like another drink

521
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,650
okay that's what I sorry there's other
social engineering going on all the time

522
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,330
yeah I'm sure you're quite good you know
well yes and no I mean I

523
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,529
kind if would like drink works very well
yeah it does in

524
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,240
and you know those are those are
absolutely fascinating

525
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,400
thoughts with you entertain writing them
down is kinda the former journalism

526
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,440
give you 1000 dollars a month from now
on

527
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,960
you know yeah ride

528
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,460
I mean we just throw money around but
but I E I was at

529
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,970
hackers in 1994 when they did the first
social engineering telephone call

530
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,120
and they got the operator to give up the
pens and stuff

531
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,410
I mean as 750 people just

532
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:53,420
roared and up in front was the AT&T guy
who knew that his operator Justin had

533
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,370
at he was just there is smoke was coming
out of his ears

534
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,150
a some social engineering is something I
think actors do better than spy spy's

535
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,920
just throw money at the problem

536
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,790
and and and they get what they pay for
which is often

537
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,140
stuff that's not worth it in the back
first here

538
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,410
I'm not surprised that we get to talk
about these things

539
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,690
and not get bothered too much but and
very surprised that no one is

540
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,109
bothered you were taking you higher
ratings hoops

541
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:25,859
X expand on that and share with us well
for the first

542
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:31,000
for the first from 1992

543
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,510
to about nineteen ninety will for stuff
I've held SAT K

544
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:41,380
compartment crypto clearances for thirty
years from 1976 to 2006

545
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,600
on my loyalty is beyond question have
passed to lifestyle polygraphs for CIA

546
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,630
and one for the united nations

547
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,900
on

548
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,100
and I have no CIA pension they can be
held back

549
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,490
so there's not much they can do and
they're really don't

550
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:06,560
kill small pests and I'm nothing more
than a small past

551
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,609
so what

552
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:15,380
no I actually have a very interesting
loyal following in sight see I

553
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,330
there there people there that really
wanna see the place work

554
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:24,529
but so initially I was called a lunatic

555
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,930
for thinking open sources could be
anything

556
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,399
better than spine and

557
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,140
then I became an annoyance but all look
behold

558
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,259
my first book and the forward from pass
chairman of the Senate Select Committee

559
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,390
for intelligence my second

560
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,000
who is a democrat my second book at a
forward from the contract

561
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,250
chairman of the Senate Select Committee
for intelligence at this point you don't

562
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,100
bother me

563
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,540
because if you do will have political
implications

564
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,190
at this point he said shut up grit your
teeth which is what you're doing now

565
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,339
Dana priest does this new series on the
icy

566
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,799
I mean she's ten years late I rewrote
the book 2009 other guys read a book

567
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,650
called spice for higher

568
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,670
which as talked about how seventy
percent over money goes into contractors

569
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:18,440
rather than real spine on so long and
short of it is I think I'm considered to

570
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,470
be

571
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:24,500
a Brillion pain in the ass

572
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,290
who is right but is so annoying

573
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,970
and so threatening to the current status
quo that there's no point even

574
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,010
considering

575
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,170
ideas and

576
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,900
so it goes now the sad part is a lot of
other governments have taken my ideas

577
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,109
run with and

578
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:49,350
well it is I mean actually Eastern
Europe just was an explosion

579
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,390
open source intelligence centers and
things like that

580
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,529
and where where I have not been
successful is it getting the

581
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,790
eight tries to talk to each other
because I really want to get just one

582
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,759
country

583
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,580
we have a common center have the
academic

584
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,230
commercial government law enforcement
military

585
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,640
media non-governmental and civil society
all

586
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,700
like the chambers of commerce plus the
journalists Association's plus the

587
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,430
Academic Council

588
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,410
is just amazing you can do if everybody
talks to each other

589
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,700
all right sir let's go to you this

590
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,690
mace mean I me you can answer some the
you've dealt with

591
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,450
security is what you've done this for
selectronic security

592
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,810
and also bit like drug surveillance
systems families that sort of thing

593
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,950
on I obviously something to be talk

594
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,359
story I mean ship

595
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,660
these days you can you can buy for 250
bucks

596
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,779
wonderful GPS you put on your wife's car

597
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,920
let down everywhere she's been less than
that actually yeah

598
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,580
yeah expect the point is that is that
stuff that we used to have to pay

599
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,859
three-peat we stepped pay six-man teams
in

600
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:03,049
two cars and a motorcycle and one foot
guy

601
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,310
and to that stuff now Scotland Yard

602
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,380
implemented all of my ideas and they
found that

603
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,820
where they used to have to spend three
thousand pounds a day for surveillance

604
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,130
team they can out 230 pounds for credit
check report

605
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,530
and get the address the guy they were
trying to get all

606
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,580
okay and so

607
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,270
the really I mean they've they've given
me everything except the silver plated

608
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:28,880
clock

609
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,970
and last year two years ago I gave them
money well the

610
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,109
Bobby had in the night stick that they
gave me with her

611
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:39,720
but Scotland Yard has been putting away
more tears

612
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,350
arms merchants faster better cheaper
with open source intelligence and that's

613
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,819
why Sir David Van Ness got my did

614
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,730
and one of the interesting sidelines
come back to electronics around in a sec

615
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:55,640
make this point one of the interesting
sidelines is that we ended up

616
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,830
confiscating

617
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,029
more ill-gotten gains by a hundredfold

618
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,890
because spies don't do real estate taxes
and so open source was able to identify

619
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:05,870
the

620
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,759
the French Riviera house a whole bunch
of other stuff

621
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,220
and so lemme Scotland Yard made out like
them banded

622
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,720
with post-conviction confiscations now
on electronic surveillance

623
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,940
back in the day it had it have cell
phones

624
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,410
and you had to have clunky radios when
you were trying to communicate

625
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,350
and stuff I mean these days I think it's
absolutely wonderful you can pop a

626
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,549
webcam in front of an embassy or in
front of a place in

627
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,310
and do remote surveillance from anywhere

628
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,700
and really very very meticulous about

629
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,170
watching stuff as yet bugs and taps

630
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,320
well it that way yeah you know and and
and frankly most I mean I've done bugs

631
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,800
textbook cases bugs and stuff

632
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,960
most the time they're not worth it
because you end up having to have

633
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,910
I mean first of these past looks so
probable source

634
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,870
those days blood had to have a receiver
with like

635
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,190
150 to 200 feet typically which can be a
hard

636
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,660
issue in some places where can they be
that have a transcriber who was willing

637
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,370
to sit there and spent his life

638
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,100
listening to noise or recorder lisa
price list here

639
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,540
yeah and at the end of the day when I
found is it

640
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,800
is it for every hour 340 your

641
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,589
lucky if you get one minute anything the
bottom line is it's a lot better to just

642
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,020
have a few minutes or sick

643
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,780
cut to the chase and so most electronic
surveillance including

644
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,780
most NSA does is worthless

645
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,520
are as yesterday read what's the what's
most interesting store you

646
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,200
came across such a situation agency
involving this type of thing

647
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,720
was withdrawn archives was for that
matter

648
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,800
most interesting story I've heard is

649
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,350
that there was once a night here your
country

650
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:02,580
knew that we were very good at looking
for electronic devices

651
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,450
so they built some very complex ceramic

652
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:11,339
sounds tunnels could not be detected

653
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:18,339
actually faster well basically acoustics

654
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,330
yeah I mean why the ceramics I mean if
you look at the Irish am so impressed

655
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,339
they

656
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:26,700
they did a national survey or whatever
they were thinking about how to survive

657
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,950
how to resurrect Ireland they do they
were good it's ceramics and then they

658
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,810
discovered that ceramics a useful

659
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:38,810
in electronics so that was cool

660
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:42,850
no no no I'm talking to different things
the Irish drink ceramics

661
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,069
someone else to but you know you most

662
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:49,660
most electronic surveillance I've I've
never been fun

663
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,710
and in actually today digital

664
00:44:53,710 --> 00:45:00,710
alarms are a lot tougher in the old days
you know

665
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,320
almost a foot CIA does is

666
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,210
worth paying for yeah

667
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,000
you good I'm good Ridge

668
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,990
because you only got an hour left i mean
to you to your deadline anyway

669
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,140
he has to keep you going till 10 I think
they'll quit

670
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,779
10 minutes think today I mean

671
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,120
I mean daily breakfast no I'm fine I'll
pick up some donuts on the way out the

672
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,529
door

673
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:36,270
again all I have to do is get those
boxes in I asked to tell the guys to

674
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,330
order the car up

675
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,950
and get the boxes in the car give the
porter 20 but bill

676
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,150
and for and itself with my GPS

677
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,440
I should be fine on

678
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,200
and you and i cant talk of line about
whether someone wants a ride

679
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,130
driver on balance a I tend to go on my
own but we'll talk

680
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,050
okay and I just want to make sure that
and just a quick announcement for

681
00:45:59,050 --> 00:45:59,950
everybody here

682
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,350
on because housekeeping is not really
going to get a chance to do a super

683
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,490
thorough job with the room

684
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,400
if you could just pick up all the
bottles the broken plastic cups whole

685
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,650
Rab racing yeah absolutely ask that you
get it's also a great way to wake up and

686
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,730
keep going and so the

687
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,020
right you guys could just don't you keep
listening keep asking questions but

688
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,060
if you're leaving the room try to pick
something up to take it out and that

689
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,160
applies for everything

690
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,670
the rest the day to make Teranga year
thank you I'm inclined to stop at seven

691
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,180
because I see people falling asleep here

692
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,750
so so why don't you guys

693
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,420
1890 know why don't you guys come up
with like three really cool

694
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,590
questions and let me answer them think
is an

695
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:45,700
using it worked as well the same day
fella

696
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,820
we heard

697
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,810
RAM and talk about you know privacy is
that get over it

698
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,910
and and all the different ways that were
all using privacy

699
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:02,580
and earth and the US the industry let's
say almost ten years ago

700
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:07,390
how much is what RAM and five min being
used by your current

701
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:12,040
or by any current first of the the UN
dozens find anybody

702
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,759
but I i urge you to read my

703
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,540
might human intelligence monograph
because it distinguishes between the

704
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,090
four classified slices and the 11
unclassified slices if you meant

705
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,920
on you know the bottom line is that the

706
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,680
intelligence community will use anything
that costs money

707
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:40,680
and they will ignore anything that
doesn't cost money

708
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,700
so a.m. love his businesses like you
know you're eleven dollars this database

709
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,940
seven dollars is that a base in all laws
is given a

710
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,410
it's no big deal as long as you have
great potentials it's all yours well not

711
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:51,990
really

712
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:57,310
actually intelligence analysts today who
want to do interagency database checks

713
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:00,380
probably spend a third of their time
this negotiating

714
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:05,830
the password ship and they're lucky if
they can spend the third time actually

715
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,240
grabbing relevant data

716
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,820
in the words of one of the Int'l Inc
administrators

717
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,230
few years ago it's a crapshoot

718
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,260
K

719
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,330
I mean really you gotta you gotta
realize that the intelligence community

720
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,590
database system

721
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:26,360
is a whole series is still fights built
by a hundred different contractors none

722
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,070
of us wanted

723
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,480
any other contractor to be able to
connect to their database it's a

724
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,170
nightmare

725
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,460
because secrecy it's almost impossible
to resolve

726
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,970
which is why I wanted to create an open
source agency that would set the gold

727
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:41,530
standard

728
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:47,260
for what could be known shared and then
from there we would move to

729
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,600
creating a completely new classified
system

730
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,680
that would have attributes on each datum

731
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,370
for who could see yup

732
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:04,480
okay so now when I was in college I I
joined like I guess you could say was

733
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,970
like a secret society in

734
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:09,620
you know from when I was younger I will
talk about it but

735
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,740
when I was younger you know like I had
watched movies and you know you have

736
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,990
this whole big ideal what that's going
to be like

737
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,290
and I would say for a good three month
period I walked around with my dick was

738
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,259
two feet long

739
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:26,020
soho like so that what I'm wondering

740
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,280
dog a person of and you tell us how do
you know

741
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,620
you grew up in a major where you know
like

742
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,980
there were spy movies there was james
bond like

743
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,680
mentally michael Mosley what was it like
that first like

744
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,950
three-month period where you were like
in

745
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,240
no now if you if you ever want a good
time go to

746
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,860
go to Williamsburg in the springtime
look for all the kids with Pentax

747
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,950
cameras

748
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:56,630
you know the take pictures love dead
drops in

749
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,920
foot tosses car tosses stuff

750
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,620
I mean it's a who because I when I was
doing it

751
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,850
its so when I was when I was the right I
could look up

752
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:14,580
and I saw these two lawyers and they
were looking down and i cant kinda hear

753
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,960
them saying only the new prop this
arrived

754
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,430
you know on

755
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:26,799
I felt like I was a Jesuit priest the
sacred order

756
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,460
and I mean it viscerally hurt me to
leave the clandestine service for his my

757
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,980
identity was all wrapped up in it

758
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,960
but I am grew it and

759
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,870
there's certainly some spying that needs
to be done and some others terrifying

760
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,370
and the fact I based on my own
experience I I we're going to law

761
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,529
enforcement but that'll

762
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,030
the average law enforcement life is
ninety percent sure boredom in 10

763
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,760
percent sure terror

764
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,400
and that comes pretty close to my own
experience ninety percent

765
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,960
border and 10 percent sure tear

766
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,260
no I don't miss it in fact I love
working for the UN

767
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,690
because in Guatemala I feel doing some
good

768
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:16,110
and I'm doing it without breaking any
laws and doing it very inexpensively

769
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:19,570
and at the end of the day my integrity
is

770
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:26,570
vastly more valuable than my clearances
ever

771
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,930
so so you did to fill up

772
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,500
purpose for the government if you were
to be the

773
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,150
pose this is really a stretch perhaps
now it's not very few

774
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,280
a poster child for your position you
were like go on

775
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,020
you know let's see the all you could be
for the

776
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,180
the of few the proud the parade the

777
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,250
or you know all these other slogans out
there for

778
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,970
their government recruited how would you

779
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,910
crew you Rob sorry how would you recruit
somebody

780
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,620
to fill a position like that arm

781
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,910
in in perhaps try to be as honest as
possible saying look as long as we are

782
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:14,270
worry its all time you're going to get
lead every got the mileage as one

783
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,720
well first off I mean it's too easy
doing it in the current ways still

784
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,620
that the current wave recruits young
people are US citizens who can be

785
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,819
cleared because they've never done
anything interesting

786
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:30,770
and they don't speak a foreign language
I mean see a serial secret is like 16

787
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,520
percent

788
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,290
their population speaks a foreign
language with its

789
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,080
unbelievable if I read the T&I

790
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,250
the park from practicing for apart from
changing the position

791
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,470
eliminated

792
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,600
I would recruit people in mid-career

793
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,340
there is no cover that can be fabricated
that will stand up to 25 scrutiny

794
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,240
in how would you entice them though
because mid-career was like money

795
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,930
of course and you pay and and basically
what you want

796
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:08,800
what you want is a mid-career percent
who has spent 20 years

797
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,860
becoming a top person in the region with
rolodex that only twenty years can

798
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,210
bill you mean I'm sorry you mean region
overseas alright year

799
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:22,940
%uh and and so you find someone who
spent 20 years in Latin America has a

800
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,950
rolodex to die for

801
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:29,790
%uh and basically would like to at 10
percent spice to their life

802
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:34,040
and you basically have them continue to
live the cover that they built

803
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,380
unwittingly

804
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,170
and you really manage them very very
carefully for very very serious things

805
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,660
for example

806
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,480
no resident not should ever do a
recruitment

807
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,890
they should only handle people who have
been recruited by others in third

808
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:49,750
countries in

809
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,750
properly vetted dinner absolutely secure

810
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,620
me this is not how we do business we
have a few really great change fund

811
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,470
types and we have a few

812
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,470
really great non-official cover officers

813
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:06,070
but really there's like 45 CIA's there's
a white house CIA there's a wall street

814
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:09,030
CIA there's a bureaucracy CIA

815
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:14,460
there's a safari club tradition torture
sodomize kit CIA

816
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,200
and that is probably one other CIA sons

817
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,000
now SAT stuff and just different stuff

818
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,160
so science and technology for

819
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,509
I'm going on I'm known to people who
grew by the CIA and

820
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:34,610
in general background is is Benny the
lived in the country previously

821
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,890
or their father has some kind of
diplomatic for overseas less shipping

822
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,330
never US

823
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,029
citizens a so you're saying dole
recruited a young age

824
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,550
go for the people who were are basically
establish their well

825
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,310
I actually I actually was part of trying
to think through the future the

826
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,700
clandestine services

827
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,600
published this II had five slices

828
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,710
slice number one is young people who
were recruited

829
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:02,010
to be part of the blue the system will
be there forever

830
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,250
that's one-fifth one-fifth

831
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,880
are US citizens recruited mid-career

832
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,760
to be non-official cover officers slice
number two

833
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,000
i three the third fifty is third party

834
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,590
nationals who were recruited mid-career
to be

835
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,820
career case offices but never touching
classified materials

836
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,830
never coming back to headquarters sites
number four

837
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:33,330
the fourth a 5/5 is clandestine case
officers from

838
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,040
other countries who were recruited to be
part of a regional station for example

839
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:37,960
the committee

840
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,070
the strains the cambodians do very very
well

841
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:46,600
human trafficking penetrations by using
cambodian case officers up close and

842
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,610
Australians in

843
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,340
with money and technology and then slice
number five

844
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,410
would be it's just business if you've
got

845
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:58,149
a PC here going into a sensitive
insulation and live your someplace you

846
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,500
go to the west german business e-cell
give you a million dollars

847
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,730
I'll give you half upon insertion the
device here and I'll give you half when

848
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,450
I get signal on the other end

849
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:11,040
and never see you again and we're not
gonna give you lie detector tests

850
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,000
ship works for AT&T

851
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,680
but but is only considerably different
than the current model who are you know

852
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,330
you've grown people

853
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:24,480
well the current model you don't grow
people you views

854
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,200
good point

855
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,890
your welcome young you know I'm enough
sorry but but

856
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,430
it's pathetic I mean I look at these
young kids

857
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:44,060
I mean CIA analysts I I flew back from
the room with the World Bank guy

858
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,180
and he said that the CIA analysts it
come to see him

859
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,650
and they were so young and the
hypotheses they put forward to explain

860
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,640
instabilities

861
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,569
done were so ignorant they were
frightening

862
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:03,540
K the Boca CIA's analytic population has
less than five years an adult good and

863
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,660
even that is questionable

864
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,819
post-college

865
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:16,470
beatty about 21 it's called 21 I so
they're under 30

866
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:20,340
there under 30 they don't know jack shit
about the world and they don't speak the

867
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,900
language in the country responsible for

868
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,170
they're only there because they can't
get a clearance

869
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:33,170
and they weren't good enough to go to
wall street cheat the public

870
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:38,560
all right sir little shift um the
tsunami that happened a couple years ago

871
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,350
killed yeah it was great the people
intelligence I'm pretty sure that

872
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:46,170
that you had mentioned even the last
hope how that was orchestrator

873
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,180
there was some thing there and number
thinking about that kinda

874
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,940
but that's in my mind last couple years
and it was only recently that I heard

875
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,340
some

876
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,710
that information I'm hoping you can
verify this one the other

877
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,320
about some ungodly amount of minerals

878
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,580
that world I'm brought up from the sea

879
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,670
and landed on the on their on he takes
up no harvested

880
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:11,200
I haven't heard anything about that it's
fascinating I know there was a lot of

881
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,050
interest in

882
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:15,730
in in mining the sea in the seventies

883
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,810
but I know nothing about that yes sir

884
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,960
sorry go back to the spiced up again
sure no problem

885
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,010
on now how often do

886
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:30,070
spies like the you know but the the
double legions

887
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:33,460
or spies the power goes ahead to a wall
or

888
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,590
they still are often start doing like
clandestine things on their own outside

889
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,150
the government like such as

890
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:42,400
like movie stars were does that happen
well let me let me is that several

891
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,790
levels for example

892
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:47,550
CIA CIA made a huge mistake in the last
few years

893
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:51,210
and they authorized their case officers

894
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:57,020
to do outside consulting not to
interfere basis with their spine

895
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,370
does it make sense course says it's
stupid

896
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,500
don't think if you distribute what's
former times a month

897
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,700
I'm not hearing this wrong yes

898
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,070
clandestine services allowed its

899
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:14,230
five days to do private work on the side

900
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,850
AFP

901
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:21,490
Yemen mining is a complete thats
completely unbelievable

902
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:25,710
I'm sorry but you heard it here

903
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,750
word the so

904
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:32,840
did those people ever like you know what
screw the US these people are gonna give

905
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,320
me 10 million this month drugs do well
actually

906
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:40,420
we we have had issues with non-official
cover officers who went to corporations

907
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,540
and found out they could earn a million
dollars

908
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,279
instead for forty five thousand dollars
could you explain what

909
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,730
the that to officer does well basically
they

910
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:53,250
the non-official cover which means
they're not operating out of an embassy

911
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,270
unofficial US installations

912
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:59,180
so the 100 caught the US says

913
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,830
are we don't know what they're doing in
theory aka year

914
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,890
in theory I mean we've had we've had one
not contrite for

915
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,770
forty years in a prison and

916
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,110
me there are some very sad stories spy
swaps

917
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,320
a well yes and no I mean

918
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,450
the other day the this recent thing with
Russia

919
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,970
was the FBI fucking Obama and then the
CIA

920
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:27,810
knew that they were going to do it so
they spend some time thinking about who

921
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,330
trade and I think that's a very good
traits

922
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,250
what to you could you explain the trade
on no because I'm not familiar enough

923
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:34,840
with the

924
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,950
disk or read about it see that they got
some people that deserve to be done now

925
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:44,110
so I was I was pleased and please don't
misunderstand me I mean CIA's fuller

926
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,100
really great people including my wife

927
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,720
who we're doing the best they can with
in a very

928
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,940
that system okay it's it's a horrible
system

929
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,940
yes sir yes hi am

930
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:59,080
we've you've talked a lot about
reforming the

931
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:04,620
American system am I'm I don't know if
you mention may be reforming the UN

932
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,500
system because I just visit there

933
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,460
and their crown on merging you about and
so did

934
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,280
organization chart and was just
horrifying complexity

935
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,700
so you think that there's change to be
made

936
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,520
disprove Pressey well yeah I mean that's
what my latest book is about

937
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,410
and in there and have a chapter in the
United Nations

938
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:29,390
and I actually look at the United
Nations topics on their own website

939
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,009
United Nations is

940
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:36,480
coherent online and it hasn't got a clue
I mean it's so disorganized

941
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,820
most people don't realize this but the
secretary-general United Nations doesn't

942
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,080
have any authority at all

943
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,900
and there are a number of specialized
agencies that are basically run

944
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,820
off-budget

945
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,010
their run by contributions a combination
of allocations

946
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,360
intonations

947
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,290
however and I think the book

948
01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:00,560
properly credits the United Nations with
being a potential force with the United

949
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,480
Nations lacks intelligence

950
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,520
in every sense of the word Brahimi

951
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,990
did this very well the for him the
report was a superior

952
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:16,990
piece of work and then louise for sure
Canadian yeah

953
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,800
it good I mean Louise for shit came into
the united nations

954
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,140
horrified I mean they didn't have staff
processes that

955
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,200
briefing papers they didn't have a way
of supporting

956
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,640
decisions and one other things that
published a book on peacekeeping

957
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:31,540
intelligence

958
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:36,250
you know if you don't have strategic
intelligence you don't get the mandate

959
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:36,540
right

960
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,560
if you don't have operational
intelligence you don't get the force

961
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,360
structure right

962
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,950
if you don't have tactical intelligence
you lose people and don't get the

963
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,550
mission done and if you don't have
technical intelligence

964
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:50,560
you're basically incapacitate on and so

965
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,650
all number of a sieve worked very hard

966
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,550
over the past few years to try and
develop a concept UN intelligence

967
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:01,300
professor Walt Dohrn is one of the
leaders in this field

968
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,460
on and General Patrick compare myself a
few others

969
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:10,800
basically the United Nations right now
suffers from the fact that it's

970
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,200
depended on member nations for both
money

971
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,360
and information and personnel and

972
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:23,350
a third of the UN is that the two
Stickley incompetent a third of the UN

973
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:27,549
is spies who were fine as long as you
take people to launch but they're also

974
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,590
uncover jobs they don't understand

975
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:34,140
and so the reality is the UN is running
on the backs of one third of the people

976
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,440
who are real UN

977
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,350
and that's a problem but the other thing
the UN hasn't figured out how to do is

978
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,690
how to become a harp

979
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:45,560
for multinational information sharing
and sensemaking

980
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,150
and I honestly don't know if I'll
survive

981
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:53,350
I mean there's every chance that I will
be fired by the UN on any given day

982
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:57,400
because I am is

983
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,410
and medical to the UN cultures it's
possible to get

984
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:06,710
and so we'll see how this goes but if
you want to help me talk my book up to

985
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,570
anybody this with the UN

986
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:12,170
elements free online would love to see
the

987
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:15,440
the book it spread around yes sir you're
shaking your head

988
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,530
I'm see my head the at my behind he's
excited

989
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:24,490
on I wanna talk about out about four
years ago they found the CIA plane that

990
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,990
hours trackback to

991
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:32,090
shopping mall or whatever and now its
track back to a drug-trafficking cartel

992
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:35,340
and as you watch the Great White hype
hope

993
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:39,050
up what's a whole bunch of crack back
into you

994
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,970
South Central America are LA

995
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:48,030
i think im I made a misstep fired but

996
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,140
fantastic if you are if you slept
through it that's okay there's a lot of

997
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:52,620
drug dealers in

998
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,960
Ricky Ross yeah I love about him early I
mean basically

999
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,430
CIA that's an honor to jail and we put
Ricky Ross in jail and and that movie is

1000
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,730
probably ten years old and they found
that airplane

1001
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:08,170
five years ago so sup still going on
obviously

1002
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,150
yet bill this still small aircraft
braking large amounts of drugs across

1003
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:17,320
I continue to speculate that CIA and DEA
are running drugs in the United States

1004
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,990
I do you think it's for money or do you
think it's for some other

1005
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:25,290
profit Mar like is there another reason
they're I'm sure there's a series of

1006
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,560
complex reasons

1007
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,220
and can it be enough volume to really
you know make a difference

1008
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:33,660
yeah I mean just three

1009
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:40,230
re read my review Dark Alliance okay up
here that will go back to you

1010
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:44,690
can you speak about you work in
Guatemala and you know there's

1011
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:50,470
is it know the short answer is No I mean
it's it's a miracle they let me come up

1012
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,170
here at all

1013
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:54,480
so I'm very pleased to be part of the UN

1014
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,660
this conference has nothing to do with
the UN

1015
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,470
my remarks on my own on but I will tell
you that the UN

1016
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:07,540
is experiencing some serious success in
Guatemala with the hybrid organization

1017
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:13,640
which is helping the government to learn
how to put people in jail in do

1018
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,970
investigative work

1019
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:18,540
and how to be effective because
unfortunately when

1020
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:25,110
governments failed gangs prosper and so
what we have to do is help governments p

1021
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:29,860
legitimate and efficient and when you do
that

1022
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,870
it has a very beneficial effect on the
economy because investors and gain

1023
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:34,720
confidence

1024
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,000
what senator no

1025
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,620
but mexico desperately needs it so does
the United States

1026
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:46,100
I mean really corruption is

1027
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:50,080
scorch corruption is what enables crime

1028
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:57,080
wanted provision professional
provisional 1

1029
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:06,630
well i i think the legalization of drugs
is certainly

1030
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:10,290
an important part of the solution
another

1031
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:14,630
insist on this very successfully but
that's not my real

1032
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:19,350
feel so let me go to you on the back
yeah I was actually morning with

1033
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:22,700
what column baseline training

1034
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:26,320
techniques for instance the to the
briefing if you like

1035
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,100
basic marine training any martial arts
combat

1036
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,500
special weapons training the no

1037
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,830
Taipei I and how many words per minute
with this the

1038
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:43,150
yeah guy you wanna be up to over 200

1039
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:46,280
you get bonuses for combat

1040
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,900
you know if your gonna 14 years on no

1041
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,490
no of up but you get to take a bathroom
break

1042
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:56,630
now you know I mean

1043
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:00,960
its inner CSI New York up in New York
cops get 6 months training

1044
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,980
Marine Corps infantry lieutenants get 6
months training spies get 6 months

1045
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,510
training

1046
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:08,830
and it's basically covers the

1047
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:12,400
what's called the intelligence cycle so
there's there's

1048
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,730
recruitment well actually this finding
in assessing

1049
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:19,149
and then there's recruiting and then
there's Hanley

1050
01:08:19,149 --> 01:08:22,240
and I i'm sorry spotting assessing

1051
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:27,630
developing recruiting handling and then
termination which just means

1052
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:32,600
paying them enough so they don't talk
about it afterwards and so you get

1053
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,509
training in those things and

1054
01:08:34,509 --> 01:08:37,569
the biggest the biggest part

1055
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:41,770
is is making sure that you understand
how to debrief somebody and how to take

1056
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:42,470
notes and

1057
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:47,990
how to not be discovered doing all that
and then how to type it all up

1058
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,500
get back I was good I was going to add
that

1059
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,520
you know six months training is
generally when the Gunners mate on a

1060
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,279
Navy ship

1061
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,480
com has to point you in the right
direction

1062
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,970
alone Southwark right that so what do
how do you supplement that

1063
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:07,370
are you house do you feel naked when he
finally like reality hurts when he's in

1064
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,309
fact years

1065
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,420
their Easter several books by young CA
people

1066
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:15,100
CIA after training wrote books there
beneath contempt

1067
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,020
on the training is actually a weeding
out process

1068
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,390
and if you graduate from training then
you really learn your job

1069
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:25,940
the first tour overseas you learn that
under Chief

1070
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:29,190
station chief operations who actually

1071
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:32,440
walk you through doing it for real

1072
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,660
so so the biggest hit a guy hit the
streets after training

1073
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:40,108
your your advice would be one what what
what supplemental to that

1074
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:44,040
that you've learned well it's not advice
that I followed because I probably stood

1075
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,670
out like a neon sign

1076
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:51,640
police now now then I was the gendered
riser bunny

1077
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,020
and the throwing money around like it
was going out of style

1078
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:00,600
and you know so and going in and out of
an official installations

1079
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,170
so I'm quite sure they're liaison new

1080
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:08,520
every single person I was talking to and
so I was basically just

1081
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,540
living fraud and

1082
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,150
and that's what I don't think people are
really willing to accept is the fact

1083
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,460
that most of what CA

1084
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:20,860
does is known locally a sign they're
controlling the information

1085
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,339
they're fully aware of what's been
called the CIA they're probably feeding

1086
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,770
some

1087
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:29,020
and we pretended am in fact this is
actually true

1088
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:33,780
when CIA found out that at least one of
its major soviet agents was being

1089
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,250
controlled by the KGB

1090
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:40,590
they did not tell the president they
actually continued to feed intelligence

1091
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:43,040
from an asset to the president

1092
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,370
and not tell them that it was a
controlled source being run by the KGB I

1093
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:47,860
mean this is this is

1094
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:52,150
attacker is just mind-boggling

1095
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:55,790
okay I got a different question for you
here mom

1096
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,500
what can you tell us

1097
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,720
whatever you can dollars on any type

1098
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,950
extraterrestrial contact that the CIA

1099
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:09,670
where for you dry

1100
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:16,200
well I can't speak for CIA the I
personally was on loan at three

1101
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,320
yesterday

1102
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,130
yeah now %uh

1103
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:25,360
I read a number of books in hidden truth
and

1104
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,929
is these two books by this guy answer
whatever he just had a very interesting

1105
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:30,110
conference

1106
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:33,299
Midwest and there was an MIT book

1107
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,140
on on encounters with extraterrestrials
and

1108
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:41,080
I'm quite satisfied and also governments
are starting to declassify

1109
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,570
their UFO stuff the government of Brazil

1110
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:49,519
Chile and so what's what's happening now
is we're starting to see

1111
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,650
a serious massive evidence come out

1112
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:56,860
that there have been extraterrestrial
contact since the 1940s

1113
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:59,940
and the government has been keeping it
secret in part because they've

1114
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:05,630
harvesting technologies and I really
don't know the details

1115
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:09,290
and I certain

1116
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:13,370
yeah I do like him horses books

1117
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:16,840
mars MA RRS

1118
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,920
yeah bottom line is I don't know what
CIA knows about extraterrestrial but

1119
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,450
frankly that's most the Air Force domain

1120
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:27,160
they've kinda claims that area

1121
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,920
and it is

1122
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,929
it's not something I was privy to its
not something I'd

1123
01:12:32,929 --> 01:12:37,870
violate if I were privy to but based
exclusively on open source intelligence

1124
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:41,059
there is extraterrestrial life out there
we scare the shit out of them

1125
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:44,310
and we have been abusing the public

1126
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:49,130
by keeping all the secret all these
years was and

1127
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:53,449
said if

1128
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:59,860
the fact that we're nuclear don't know
how to handle it what's at

1129
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:03,489
they have

1130
01:13:03,489 --> 01:13:07,030
daily others though sonya

1131
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:10,090
of Milan

1132
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:14,400
out I was initially asked about the the
election cycle here

1133
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,659
and how someone a sheeple a every four
years

1134
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:23,469
you know I like them yeah every four
years the Canada side after all you know

1135
01:13:23,469 --> 01:13:28,010
me some little bit of hope little to
change out there

1136
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:31,820
is on theater I mean Chomsky wrote the
book on it manufacturing consent which

1137
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,320
actually has to offer some so how do we
get

1138
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,849
how to get around that though because I
know they're other countries I've heard

1139
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:40,510
there are other countries out there
perhaps these Canadians here

1140
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:44,670
but but I've heard there are other
countries out there

1141
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,880
Rev %uh different electorate arm

1142
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,390
criteria for instance where job perhaps
majority doesn't rule was based on a

1143
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:55,199
percentage above your life

1144
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,230
I I personally like parliamentary
systems

1145
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:03,510
because I really do not like
winner-take-all it really messes up

1146
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,000
I like parliamentary systems and

1147
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,130
I certainly like systems that

1148
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:13,409
absolutely do not allow committees the
whole secret hearings

1149
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:18,580
or secret earmark hearings are secret
authorization for preparation and what

1150
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,440
would that be

1151
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,969
just as a reasonable me like are

1152
01:14:22,969 --> 01:14:26,050
are they really going on right now I
mean I honestly don't

1153
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:30,510
lover actor perhaps I have not really
studied this

1154
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:33,980
I just know that secrecy is a cancer and

1155
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:40,100
we passed feet these people accountable
and transparent and that's not happening

1156
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:40,820
know obviously

1157
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:44,940
but but the problem is up guess what
we're not like

1158
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,080
the old guys who were like there are
four years before because you're short

1159
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,929
term memory only goes back like

1160
01:14:50,929 --> 01:14:57,929
for the three years and nine months back
you can talk to me like that all people

1161
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,400
I does does this reach into the restroom
because I i wanna miss you every time

1162
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:10,400
we're on

1163
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:28,330
who'd

1164
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:33,780
said or

1165
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,679
in the problem two-party system

1166
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:44,680
by wondered

1167
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:55,520
for said

1168
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:33,320
here

1169
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:42,060
are during his rest period lou would
like the

1170
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:49,060
see some show tunes here I don't think

1171
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:14,200
here

1172
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:30,349
I i do believe

1173
01:17:30,349 --> 01:17:33,510
technically 616 if you look into

1174
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:39,849
local history governor

1175
01:17:39,849 --> 01:17:44,989
or whatever you want but no I mean
really amazing guys hung out but I'm

1176
01:17:44,989 --> 01:17:47,590
kinda take a pic that that we made it
eight hours

1177
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:51,500
results I guess basic i'm saying is
every four years ago through the site

1178
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,800
where people can I forget what happened
during the previous four years

1179
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,500
in the administration walks in there and
says whole way to me here

1180
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,170
were eight new administration know I
know that's why I think

1181
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:06,949
honest to god the hack is to basically
get the public to understand that they

1182
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:07,739
have to vote

1183
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:11,380
out every single incumbent do you think
there's something wrong with the

1184
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,730
two-party system and and how we fix that

1185
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:18,929
it's a two-party Tierney

1186
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:23,420
it represents fewer than thirty percent
of the overall american Public

1187
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:27,810
it is absolutely one of the most corrupt

1188
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:32,560
systems on the planet it's kinda soft
hit

1189
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,739
corruption so I'm

1190
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:39,829
I yes I think we have to get rid of the
Republican and Democratic parties

1191
01:18:39,829 --> 01:18:44,239
and i frankly you know I'd love to see
how our team

1192
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:51,119
or sam nunn I'd love to see sam nunn get
together with lee iacocca in

1193
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,150
create the American party so so which
one takes his place we give real

1194
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:59,849
two majors whether 63 others which

1195
01:18:59,849 --> 01:19:03,630
course never get heard of public TV or a
news story

1196
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:08,090
great I meet for me I love I don't know
if it's true or not but it said that

1197
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,630
when eisenhower came back

1198
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:13,179
from overseas Marshall said

1199
01:19:13,179 --> 01:19:16,329
this is from a DVD enactment so Marshall
said

1200
01:19:16,329 --> 01:19:19,829
everyone's trying to get you to run for
president where are you a democrat or

1201
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:21,739
republican and he said I'm American

1202
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:24,969
and that's the only acceptable answer

1203
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:28,710
soul bottom line here is I think we need

1204
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:32,190
don't politics and elect people and hold
those people accountable to their

1205
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:33,349
constituencies

1206
01:19:33,349 --> 01:19:37,710
and they need to understand that we are
on them like stink on shit

1207
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:41,420
and we are all over them every single
day

1208
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:46,300
anytime they have a secret meeting it is
a big black mark that's on the front

1209
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:46,929
page

1210
01:19:46,929 --> 01:19:50,369
yes sir could you

1211
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:54,170
I'm your considered opinion about
Goldman Sachs and financial capital

1212
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:59,059
now the game the system go home welfare
benefit might my knowledge is strictly

1213
01:19:59,059 --> 01:20:01,360
limited to open source is that I've read

1214
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:07,639
but Goldman Sachs his game the system in
part with with high-speed trading

1215
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:11,380
on manipulating markets lying

1216
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:17,099
two governments and generally betraying
the public trust in such a way that if I

1217
01:20:17,099 --> 01:20:20,550
were gone they would lose their charter
tomorrow night bankrupt every single one

1218
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,489
other executives

1219
01:20:21,489 --> 01:20:25,139
forever

1220
01:20:25,139 --> 01:20:28,800
but certainly the last twenty thirty
years and in fact you can really trace

1221
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,179
all this back to the roster

1222
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:35,000
trials introducing central banking and
sponsoring the Civil War

1223
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,040
to basically get the north and the south
the fight each other

1224
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:42,849
this is really ugly shit and it's not
taught in high school or college

1225
01:20:42,849 --> 01:20:46,320
yessir your front

1226
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,780
you okay and do you think by

1227
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:54,790
giving more visibility to or other
parties would be enough to change their

1228
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:59,570
no on in fact I really don't like the
party system

1229
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:03,159
all because I think what we should be
doing all the party system can in theory

1230
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:06,469
be used to organize people with like
preferences

1231
01:21:06,469 --> 01:21:10,829
the greens for example although they
don't seem to know much about green

1232
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:15,409
are but I think that what we really have
to get to

1233
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:19,219
is participatory public budgeting

1234
01:21:19,219 --> 01:21:22,980
which is to say the public as to be put
in touch with reality we have to put

1235
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,719
dollar signs on our choices

1236
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,460
and we really have to understand what it
meets

1237
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:32,540
to be a citizen and to be a democratic
polity

1238
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:36,019
which every citizen has a state in the
truth

1239
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,960
the integrity of every decision that's
made I mean what we've been doing is

1240
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,829
making decisions based on ideological
fantasy

1241
01:21:42,829 --> 01:21:47,159
on and special interests corruption and
we have not been making

1242
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:51,589
we haven't been doing
intelligence-driven democracy the

1243
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:55,110
so you're saying that people through
vote more often

1244
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,820
about voter or yes as a matter fact I
would like to see

1245
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:03,219
almost every major issue put to a public
ballot

1246
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:06,849
and and then that's simple to do
particularly if you have libraries are

1247
01:22:06,849 --> 01:22:08,280
actually the same

1248
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:13,639
voting stations on that are there at
cell phone something you could make

1249
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:14,670
cellphones

1250
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:18,239
be arm you know a form of

1251
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:21,900
authenticated personal preference the
bottom line here

1252
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:27,050
is we have abdicated our responsibility
for being informed influencing

1253
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:30,329
government

1254
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:34,480
yessir I am not too long ago we we

1255
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,550
test a nuclear bomb and we discovered it
worked and then we

1256
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:41,840
immediately after that dropped to
another country and since then

1257
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,170
the United States is tested more than
1000 the restaurant combine is also

1258
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:49,730
has additional 1000 how come

1259
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:53,900
materials and that technology has in
fallen and been used

1260
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:57,540
outside those additional $2 for were
wise it only state in

1261
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:00,790
testing for the most part

1262
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,760
really don't know the answer to that but
I do believe

1263
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,949
those who think that nuclear basically

1264
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:12,030
nuclear if you if you if you accept the

1265
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:17,059
the pieces this war is a racket

1266
01:23:17,059 --> 01:23:20,579
in the war is a wave of looting
populations both the

1267
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:24,199
for making population in the war victim
populations

1268
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:27,980
then nuclear

1269
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:31,750
was a wrong turn because nuclear

1270
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:35,270
all the sudden was a lose-lose
proposition

1271
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:39,429
and so I think the powers-that-be said
Oh shit

1272
01:23:39,429 --> 01:23:42,980
we made a mistake we should never gun
nuclear

1273
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:47,159
and I I was in a in a harvard class with

1274
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:52,190
other sess including can manhandle was
the had a Venice a one-point

1275
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:55,440
and we were play-acting congressional
testimony

1276
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,309
and someone playing acting a senator
said

1277
01:23:59,309 --> 01:24:03,829
so how can we be sure we will win the
nuclear war and the perfect class answer

1278
01:24:03,829 --> 01:24:07,820
was from this one guys that senator
there are no winners in a nuclear war

1279
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:10,989
on and I think that was the right answer
I think the

1280
01:24:10,989 --> 01:24:14,440
powers-that-be understand that which is
why low-intensity conflict became so

1281
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,710
popular

1282
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:19,679
because it's a proxy that can be managed
a nuclear war gets

1283
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:24,679
outta control too quick all it's one
thing for the the powers that be to

1284
01:24:24,679 --> 01:24:28,619
choose not to do it but what about like
Tucson a rational person going to a

1285
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:31,869
country where scarred by barbed wire
fence and one guard

1286
01:24:31,869 --> 01:24:36,730
to just speared away the materials is
just dumb luck that that's not happening

1287
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:37,559
are we just

1288
01:24:37,559 --> 01:24:40,739
or is it being actively being staff

1289
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:47,739
now I don't think it's actively being
stopped except for the isolated

1290
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:51,570
recall those FBI operation sting
operations

1291
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:56,159
on

1292
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:59,360
there is so much money to be made in
other ways

1293
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,199
I just don't I can't give you any
speculative answer

1294
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:07,190
it it comes down to only an idiot would
try to obtain

1295
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:12,050
its get caught well i I always love the
annual Darwin Award such as the guided

1296
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:17,320
sat in front of the microwave to be warm
you know

1297
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:21,360
I mean nuclear stuff a and one of the
things we're worried about is

1298
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,969
radiological

1299
01:25:22,969 --> 01:25:27,940
because you could contaminate you know
an entire city block for

1300
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:31,500
a long time with with radiological

1301
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,670
trash I'm really concerned that

1302
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,889
pandora's out of the box and

1303
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:43,540
and the only thing keeping a safe is a
modicum of legitimacy

1304
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,559
and really were about to burst
legitimacy

1305
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:52,570
bubble particularly in relation to the
United States as it's perceived overseas

1306
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:56,869
I would not want to be an American
tourist traveling in a Muslim country

1307
01:25:56,869 --> 01:26:00,308
anytime soon because there are just too
many people

1308
01:26:00,309 --> 01:26:03,880
that did hot well they

1309
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,540
you know I mean there's the america the
beautiful ideal there's there's the

1310
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,059
american public

1311
01:26:09,059 --> 01:26:12,900
I think most people understand the
American public is a big-hearted public

1312
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:17,139
but they're also fanatics who feel that
any american is a target

1313
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:21,280
you know knows I don't have any answers
sir

1314
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,269
so this is going to sound like a
softball question but it's it's

1315
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:25,489
completely earnest

1316
01:26:25,489 --> 01:26:29,610
on because it's manifestly obvious that
you read prodigiously

1317
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:33,409
so so there's only there's only so many
hours in a day how do you choose what to

1318
01:26:33,409 --> 01:26:34,630
read

1319
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:37,750
it's a good question

1320
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:42,020
I use to use to buy books at airports

1321
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,239
in in I've been pleasantly surprised by
how good

1322
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:50,719
the this election has been but when I
got hooked on Amazon

1323
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:54,190
and I was an accident I basically

1324
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:57,309
my first book was just gonna be an
opinion piece

1325
01:26:57,309 --> 01:27:01,139
and then a couple I said no this is the
reference work you need to do an index

1326
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:02,679
and they said also

1327
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:06,739
you need to do an annotated bibliography
because you've read all the books

1328
01:27:06,739 --> 01:27:10,809
so so I did one and it was a 150 entries

1329
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:15,369
and then I did my second book it was a
150 entries in an Amazon reviews opened

1330
01:27:15,369 --> 01:27:19,429
up so I loaded all three hundred one
weekend like April 4th something

1331
01:27:19,429 --> 01:27:24,389
April 4th 2008 was instantly one of the
top 1500 people out other

1332
01:27:24,389 --> 01:27:28,469
1600 where on and so

1333
01:27:28,469 --> 01:27:31,920
I didn't really think much of it but
then I was invited to speak to a buncha

1334
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,130
parliamentarians in Europe and I was
intimidated sorry rate fifty books

1335
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:40,500
arm and review those as always keeping
notes

1336
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,360
and now it's Kanika the habit and since
I had my own company and

1337
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:50,239
in on a good year would make 1.7 million
was nothing spent five thousand books

1338
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:54,000
so I would generally read two books a
week more or less

1339
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,429
and I i have to say above those books a
third of them I start with the index and

1340
01:27:58,429 --> 01:28:01,530
and work my way to the footnotes a third
of them might

1341
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:04,590
really kind i read the book but fairly
quickly in a third of them I just

1342
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:07,260
scanned over the book in like for
instance the

1343
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:13,010
the 2600 book in the the Emmanuel book
it took me less than an hour to kind of

1344
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:16,409
develop an appreciation for that book
and then publish something that would

1345
01:28:16,409 --> 01:28:17,940
help other people say they're

1346
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:22,000
gotta own it so I certainly did not read
every word in that book but

1347
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,360
enough to do good review

1348
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,380
so I think

1349
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:33,760
its what

1350
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:38,440
okay was that a farter

1351
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:41,650
birth now now we've got

1352
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:46,239
26 minutes on

1353
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:50,830
basically an average book I can read it
for hours

1354
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:55,699
so early talkin you know two hours a
night four nights a week

1355
01:28:55,699 --> 01:29:00,239
and there was a time when I did a lot of
traveling I was a double gold card on

1356
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:00,790
American

1357
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:04,599
United 94 to 97 and so

1358
01:29:04,599 --> 01:29:07,659
I would read books on airplanes and in
hotels and

1359
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:13,409
and stuff on and now is for picking my
books

1360
01:29:13,409 --> 01:29:18,110
%uh the Amazon feature that when you
look at one book it tells you what other

1361
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:21,730
people have looked at what other people
have bought that's actually pretty good

1362
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:25,389
Amazon recommendations to not work for
me

1363
01:29:25,389 --> 01:29:29,070
but when I stunts one book and that's
the other thing I generally

1364
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:33,830
books and twos and threes so for example
when I decided to look at climate

1365
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:38,460
AXA gone the whether makers and one
other book and so I read like three

1366
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,679
books at the time

1367
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,080
menopause for dummies there were two
other books on menopause okay

1368
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,940
I actually wrote the memo on menopause

1369
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:51,619
if you will go look for a steal
memorandum menopause

1370
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:58,619
you'll get two pages shit every man
needs to know what the age of 30

1371
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:02,130
its

1372
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:08,080
free here you didn't get them you didn't
get the memo

1373
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,630
that's RTFM probably

1374
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:16,679
he didn't pay enough for me to spend
eight hours being tortured by you guys

1375
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:21,280
but up no I can't remember what the memo
says site I just remember that

1376
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,719
I didn't get it in time to save my
marriage so

1377
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:28,340
you know but it's useful information and
and you should

1378
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,849
you should read that memo

1379
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:35,270
okay I have two questions a short one
and a long one K

1380
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:39,469
short question among books have you read
the works Sun Woo

1381
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:42,610
no okay he created a

1382
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:45,880
book about 2,000 years ago the art of
war

1383
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,580
I'll send zoo yeah on your own you young

1384
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:53,969
tomatoes tomatoes the long question is
this: imagine a world for a moment or

1385
01:30:53,969 --> 01:30:54,900
nation

1386
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,949
where direct democracy does take root

1387
01:30:57,949 --> 01:31:00,969
prospers flowers blossoms

1388
01:31:00,969 --> 01:31:06,800
and everybody runs the country through
managers like congressman mayors Council

1389
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,280
men inside edge

1390
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:13,230
how would you you were put in charge of
the nation's spy networks in such

1391
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,790
how would view protect the country

1392
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:20,040
an open-source open democracy manner

1393
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:24,469
adhering to the words of Sun Woo to
protect our country

1394
01:31:24,469 --> 01:31:29,199
Sunwell I mean the most important thing
he said was the acme of skills to defeat

1395
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,510
the enemy without fighting

1396
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:34,059
what that really means is don't have
enemies

1397
01:31:34,059 --> 01:31:38,679
I mean the American government has done
everything possible to piss off just

1398
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:41,440
about everybody on the planet

1399
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,730
and that's just plain estupida we've
also then gone on to do everything we

1400
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:49,010
can to arm everybody on the planet

1401
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:53,290
including the Taliban including the
shiites and and everybody else

1402
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:57,610
on and then we've gone on to basically
dumb down our population and disarm our

1403
01:31:57,610 --> 01:32:00,299
population

1404
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:04,960
so for me what it boils down to and I i
calling this term in the nineteen

1405
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,630
nineties

1406
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:09,820
is cast a wide net you absolutely have
to pay attention

1407
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:12,639
everything all the time and we didn't
get a chance to talk about fourth

1408
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,309
generation warfare

1409
01:32:14,309 --> 01:32:17,960
but I've done some slides that go all
the way up to the seventh generation

1410
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:22,949
and I've written a book and a monograph
it's called information operations

1411
01:32:22,949 --> 01:32:26,269
all information all languages all the
time

1412
01:32:26,269 --> 01:32:30,150
basically the best way to protect the
nation is to educate the citizenry in

1413
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:33,250
turn every citizen into an intelligence
professional

1414
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:37,980
someone who consumes and produces and
Galax

1415
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:41,170
intelligence or actually information

1416
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:45,409
that can be converted into intelligence
as and when needed I mean snails

1417
01:32:45,409 --> 01:32:49,659
St Vincent's cell crashes great little
book

1418
01:32:49,659 --> 01:32:53,260
and and what he didn't understand was
that combining CA in the library

1419
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:56,489
congress was the worst of all possible
worlds

1420
01:32:56,489 --> 01:33:01,320
because you know one is da man the other
one is totally messed up

1421
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:06,909
would send free group

1422
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:11,550
are sold for me I really believe in 90

1423
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:17,099
I really believe that if work to get out
of this mess we have to become a smart

1424
01:33:17,099 --> 01:33:20,210
nation I wrote a book called the smart
nation act

1425
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:24,269
public intelligence Republic interest
and i've to find

1426
01:33:24,269 --> 01:33:27,340
how I would legislate a smart nation

1427
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:32,239
and what it boils down to is the party
goes the legal ethical understanding

1428
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:35,400
and the party goes to educating citizens
so that they

1429
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:39,280
are in fact the brain Housing Group for
the government

1430
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,159
we should never ever have allowed
staffers and political appointees to

1431
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:47,269
become the thinkers in our government
because that's not what they do

1432
01:33:47,269 --> 01:33:51,290
very well

1433
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:54,659
on if you go back in time to like when

1434
01:33:54,659 --> 01:34:00,280
democracy first came to fruition you
basically had a a caste system where you

1435
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,389
had

1436
01:34:01,389 --> 01:34:05,070
a group of people that said around the
forum debating whatever they need to

1437
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:05,960
debate

1438
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,619
and then you had basically entire
population those with no rights

1439
01:34:09,619 --> 01:34:13,920
tending the fields and supporting you
know those people that the right for

1440
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,230
them to set their debate the wealthy
landowners ur

1441
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:21,570
really have to be how do you how do you
create a society where

1442
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:25,259
you know the world needs ditch diggers
and people who

1443
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:29,309
can pump gas to make sandwiches and you
know everyone deserves to have their cup

1444
01:34:29,309 --> 01:34:31,019
of knowledge fill but

1445
01:34:31,019 --> 01:34:34,369
some people have very large cups and
some people have tiny thimbles

1446
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:37,679
so how does that work

1447
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,760
going back to Duran one other things he
says

1448
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:44,989
is in the lessons of history is it the
only revolution that is sustainable is

1449
01:34:44,989 --> 01:34:47,290
the revolution in the mind of man

1450
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:50,630
and one other things are really believe
is that

1451
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:54,369
and I have certainly not been good
practitioner

1452
01:34:54,369 --> 01:34:57,619
I have been arrogant and I have been
angry and I have been

1453
01:34:57,619 --> 01:35:00,869
disdainful but the bottom line is

1454
01:35:00,869 --> 01:35:04,969
everybody deserves dignity and everybody
has a point of view that deserves to be

1455
01:35:04,969 --> 01:35:05,960
heard

1456
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:09,650
and when we reach the point where we can
listen to everybody and come together

1457
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,250
and decide something without killing
each other

1458
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:15,469
that's what we will have become
unconscious civilization

1459
01:35:15,469 --> 01:35:20,599
and I'm not sure word that far from that
but I'm also not sure will reach that my

1460
01:35:20,599 --> 01:35:21,809
lifetime

1461
01:35:21,809 --> 01:35:25,040
but we're definitely moving in that
direction and

1462
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,500
just back to you say real are are these
are there any like

1463
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:33,340
things that we recommend that everyone
should read

1464
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:39,639
my reviews I'm serious I mean you should
never buy a book without checking to see

1465
01:35:39,639 --> 01:35:41,059
if i've reviewed it

1466
01:35:41,059 --> 01:35:44,119
yeah no I'm serious and and then

1467
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:48,699
my advice is to read twenty of my
reviews for every book that you buy

1468
01:35:48,699 --> 01:35:52,889
I'll save you a lot of money aka a
comment on the last

1469
01:35:52,889 --> 01:35:55,940
question about how to I guess give
everyone that

1470
01:35:55,940 --> 01:36:00,639
sustainable world on the dot said
movement in russia is a good example

1471
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:04,380
with the Russian government basically
said anybody who wants land its Russian

1472
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:04,989
citizen

1473
01:36:04,989 --> 01:36:08,360
can have a gentle and and you do
whatever you want with it

1474
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:11,530
you can't sell it you can make money
from that but you can live on in that

1475
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:13,460
can be your families kids two main

1476
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:16,960
and and this really interesting results
I think we can all really benefit if you

1477
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,780
take a look at that system

1478
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:21,440
it's interesting the other thing I've
been reading about recently is

1479
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,239
multi-generational trusts

1480
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:28,860
leverage compound interest to avoid

1481
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:32,969
the inherited generation from
diminishing the trust and

1482
01:36:32,969 --> 01:36:36,320
using up the inheritance

1483
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:40,349
we've we really I think we've really
failed

1484
01:36:40,349 --> 01:36:47,250
to leverage our knowledge to create a
world that works for all and I really

1485
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:50,960
I mean I'm not particularly inclined to
say

1486
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:55,219
reincarnation is is a fact that I think
there's some interesting ideas there and

1487
01:36:55,219 --> 01:36:57,969
I feel buckminster fuller every time I
think

1488
01:36:57,969 --> 01:37:02,000
on because he said that our task was to
make a world that works for all using

1489
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
technology resources that exist today

1490
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,670
I think I think we can do that which is
wasting too much

1491
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:14,159
which is which is killed ourselves

1492
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:17,659
so as a Canadian from

1493
01:37:17,659 --> 01:37:22,139
Toronto sure your in a i think is an FBI
jacket lol

1494
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:26,580
I a at the guns hidden but also in the
ceiling later

1495
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,729
and I governor see that's under a time
no

1496
01:37:29,729 --> 01:37:31,020
the

1497
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:34,130
reconfiguration trains everywhere

1498
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:39,619
this city currently for me seems like
it's a it's a melting dying city

1499
01:37:39,619 --> 01:37:43,710
and my go to Buffalo its it's the same
thing it's it's at it seems like we're

1500
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:44,260
and

1501
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:47,889
were at the end at least for those two
cities their their city state

1502
01:37:47,889 --> 01:37:48,840
possibilities

1503
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:52,389
and the person I love is also coming

1504
01:37:52,389 --> 01:37:57,650
a got it right every every year also and
the person I love it is from Michigan

1505
01:37:57,650 --> 01:38:03,650
in in North Flynn and its we're at these
big beautiful cities that massive

1506
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:07,050
steel structures that are all just
slowly melting and if you're in a room

1507
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:07,750
at the Hotel

1508
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:10,820
and you know it's its at the melting
room that's

1509
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:14,719
in 10 years this is going to be slaw on

1510
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,850
wait where do large cities fit into the

1511
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:21,449
the future well

1512
01:38:21,449 --> 01:38:24,949
I'm I'm certainly not the original
thinker on this but I've seen some very

1513
01:38:24,949 --> 01:38:26,420
interesting suggestions

1514
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:29,730
return all these office buildings in the
condos

1515
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:32,820
and basically

1516
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:36,130
create cities where people live and work

1517
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:39,340
in the same building and

1518
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:43,690
we green all these buildings and then
somebody sees maybe need to be

1519
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:47,969
me be abandoned her or there's actually
a lot of literature on how we need to

1520
01:38:47,969 --> 01:38:49,659
terrible the strip malls

1521
01:38:49,659 --> 01:38:52,989
and and put all that concrete in the
landfill

1522
01:38:52,989 --> 01:38:58,429
and and basically restore the whole
concept of local sustainable agriculture

1523
01:38:58,429 --> 01:39:01,449
he also deep fruit farming

1524
01:39:01,449 --> 01:39:04,650
Allen yeoman's written a wonderful book
copper 31

1525
01:39:04,650 --> 01:39:09,260
on I don't have all the answers but I
think there are a whole bunch of things

1526
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:12,260
we need to stop doing and that's a
starting point

1527
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:19,260
yes sir ya know can we turn on this Mike
up front okay I just gone back to that

1528
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:23,540
one

1529
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:28,280
please um

1530
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:32,099
you a have any impact on Lake
intentional communities

1531
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:37,260
her to know that sir %uh no I'm assuming
that you're an upgraded former commune

1532
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:41,360
your business yeah no I don't but I need
Tom at lives in one

1533
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:46,269
and and again I say I come back to this
whole thing that we've we've destroyed

1534
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:47,090
humanity

1535
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:50,710
line of Tiger did a wonderful book
called the manufacture

1536
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:54,460
evil which is basically talked about how
the movement away from

1537
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:58,290
kinship cottage industries toward
manufacturing turned people in the

1538
01:39:58,290 --> 01:39:59,159
commodities

1539
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:02,710
basically destroyed the single most
important thing in the hidden wealth

1540
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:05,940
nations which is trust in and
relationships

1541
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:11,360
overall intentional communities

1542
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,440
I'm E are sorta failing but

1543
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:18,420
for the same reasons that everything
else is failing so they can provide an

1544
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,099
answer

1545
01:40:19,099 --> 01:40:22,849
with the same shit consciousness that we
where we've been talking about

1546
01:40:22,849 --> 01:40:25,860
but there are some intentional
communities they're doing well in the

1547
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:29,239
similar to the Dutch movement all those
are two things but it exactly what

1548
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:31,219
you're talking about cans means that
kinda stuff

1549
01:40:31,219 --> 01:40:35,770
I can tell where you guys down I think
we can do like three more questions

1550
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:38,860
maker 8 o'clock thing here

1551
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:43,309
said as a as execute this rowing because
um

1552
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:46,349
one their disease be essential conflict
here because on the one

1553
01:40:46,349 --> 01:40:50,300
on the one hand on technologies an
essential part

1554
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:54,050
up creating wealth in creating
prosperity for everyone's agreed but on

1555
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:54,849
the other hand

1556
01:40:54,849 --> 01:40:58,239
arm most or all of the high-technology

1557
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:02,440
that we benefit from today's produced by
industrialized economy

1558
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:06,270
so how does that square with with
restoring arm

1559
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:11,070
trust and community to as they were
before industrialization essentially

1560
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:14,099
destroyed them well

1561
01:41:14,099 --> 01:41:17,690
there there's let me answer that on
multiple levels all levels the first is

1562
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:20,909
we were completely unaware most of us
love the

1563
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:25,190
the high-tech trash in the toxins and
and so forth

1564
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:28,960
I think we need we really need to
understand the true cost in

1565
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,989
and true contents have everything a
second

1566
01:41:31,989 --> 01:41:35,500
I think that we really have failed

1567
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:39,090
to focus on connecting humanity and

1568
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:43,380
I mean I see the day when every
individual as an embedded cell phone

1569
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:46,960
all bit is also a memory aid

1570
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,179
recorder in a little bit on and

1571
01:41:50,179 --> 01:41:54,750
at hackers in Silicon Valley over 15
years ago we talked about how human

1572
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,650
reputation was going to be the commodity
in the future

1573
01:41:57,650 --> 01:42:02,730
and that individuals who basically
establish karma points on

1574
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:07,130
X were churchill would rewarded

1575
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:11,400
and look to mom again technology the
problem

1576
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,840
is that there's two kinds of
technologies there's tears

1577
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,909
information communications technologies
which

1578
01:42:17,909 --> 01:42:21,900
Michael O'Hanlon this point it out as
the only revolutionary technology out of

1579
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:25,310
all the technologies that the Department
of Defense is developing

1580
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:32,310
energy doesn't even come close and
second there are technologies

1581
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:37,380
that we should question such as air
conditioning entire cities

1582
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:41,540
rather than using a simple buckminster
fuller construct which if you have

1583
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:45,820
the the bottom of the 10th open any have
the two with the topic chills

1584
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:50,150
to like 15 degrees mom

1585
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:53,739
with send yeah

1586
01:42:53,739 --> 01:42:58,560
I mean to all of this is is we need to
be much more conscious and

1587
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,320
I I think the court comment on
technology is we

1588
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:05,580
really need to understand all of the

1589
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:09,639
all of the implications of that
technology all

1590
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:12,960
tell II don't I don't see a conflict as
much as I see

1591
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:19,960
challenge

1592
01:43:19,989 --> 01:43:23,469
on he's a good guy

1593
01:43:23,469 --> 01:43:26,520
and i've reviewed his book The
Singularity

1594
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:32,099
but anybody that does 245 whatever is a
day and tests blood twice a day is

1595
01:43:32,099 --> 01:43:35,739
absolutely a super geek

1596
01:43:35,739 --> 01:43:38,770
now it's up to 400 in the book it talks
about 200 but

1597
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:43,719
you know I mean the thats obsession

1598
01:43:43,719 --> 01:43:50,300
yessir I'm not the mikes down on
apparently

1599
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:57,170
okay I

1600
01:43:57,170 --> 01:44:00,120
alright everybody come up front and hold
hands

1601
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:06,010
and we'll sing Kumbaya and then to close
the day at a perfect perfect fashion

1602
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:13,010
yes sir right the

1603
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:28,190
them be

1604
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:33,080
you month

1605
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:36,170
for Turner law

1606
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:39,450
comes from this box chrome

1607
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:43,230
you what's left

1608
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:46,890
like what's left for people to fight
over nor you about the gay if technology

1609
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:47,810
gets to the point where

1610
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:52,380
everyone wants for nothing then a I mean

1611
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:57,530
philosophers foresaw this many years ago
and and the force of the challenge you

1612
01:44:57,530 --> 01:45:00,880
using our leisure time on and I don't

1613
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,960
have the exact quote but I i have seen
in Austin and

1614
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,730
in depictions a Benjamin Franklin
talking about how

1615
01:45:08,730 --> 01:45:12,300
his generation had to do the military
art so that the next generation

1616
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:16,790
do mathematics the next generation could
do you know

1617
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:20,040
humanities eventually ended up with
poetry up but

1618
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:24,800
the whole point here is the one and
exhaustively resource we have is the

1619
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,610
human brain

1620
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:29,030
and I think that

1621
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:32,340
I don't think we're ever going to be

1622
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:35,480
out of challenges particularly if we do
try and

1623
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:40,110
looked outer space in the cosmos and all
that

1624
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:44,210
others also inner space we haven't even
begun to explore the sea

1625
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:48,090
we haven't begun to explore the under
terrain stuff

1626
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:52,910
so I would be thrilled if we got energy
and there are people that say that we

1627
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:56,320
have extra terrestrial technologies that
solve the energy problem that we're

1628
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,440
keeping under wraps

1629
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,830
we also have pizza indestructible

1630
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:06,000
engines will run you know on on water I
mean it's just amazing to me

1631
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,080
that we have allowed capitalism

1632
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:14,309
to really pervert the whole idea of
common property and shared interests

1633
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:17,910
and so I think what we were really need
to do is

1634
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:22,450
is take a close look at all over
conventions because I think many other

1635
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:29,450
conventions throughout the day

1636
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,920
well i i the questions about my crew
credits I think micro everything is very

1637
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:51,800
cool

1638
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,980
on especially if you can reduce the
transaction cost

1639
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:59,320
to almost nothing like an SMS message
yes sir

1640
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:02,849
on

1641
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:06,560
no I I have not written in that area but
but my

1642
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:11,320
book for ten dollars which is still
available in about six copies outside

1643
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:16,460
on is a is does talk about a global
range appears stable

1644
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:19,480
and the whole idea there is to connect
individuals

1645
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:23,040
at the item-level at the flyswatter
level

1646
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:28,130
and cut out the intermediaries thats
intelligence for

1647
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:34,640
earth clarity diversity integrity and
sustainability that's a ten dollar book

1648
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:40,580
yes love money slow food so everything

1649
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:43,680
I mean that's that's good it would be
very hard for me to adjust but

1650
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:48,470
but vermont's got a lot of people with a
lot of common sense

1651
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:55,470
yes sir now wait a minute we got seven
minutes ago

1652
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:03,140
do we want to spend the seven minutes
kinda self-identify

1653
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:06,540
okay

1654
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:13,540
do you guys wanna tell me who the hell
you are okay

1655
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:20,810
on me who's in the room I open source
warfare

1656
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:27,430
him well I'm not a software guy

1657
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:32,000
soul I'm not doing anything an
open-source warfare

1658
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,350
what are you thinking about them

1659
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:39,590
my kids okay

1660
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:42,800
global Correa's for what for forward

1661
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:48,220
finding information haven't read it

1662
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:53,250
on mmm you know one other things is
really distressed me

1663
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:57,650
I mean what when I first started this
open source intelligence was in the

1664
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:58,630
evening Google

1665
01:48:58,630 --> 01:49:03,870
on and now of course its its millions
and millions of hits of which I own at

1666
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:04,950
least 30,000

1667
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:11,500
on but so many people have been so quick
to pick up on

1668
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:15,670
on terms like information operations
cyberwar

1669
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:20,530
in all this and they build multi-billion
dollar budget surrounded and they

1670
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:24,290
do with a ser recalls virtual
engineering which is

1671
01:49:24,290 --> 01:49:28,930
code for lie like a mother fucker in
your your briefings and then get money

1672
01:49:28,930 --> 01:49:29,380
in

1673
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:32,410
and fake it on and

1674
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:35,790
up it's distressing how many people are

1675
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:39,630
touting themselves as open source
intelligence you know this and that and

1676
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:40,390
so forth

1677
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:45,370
mom I think one other comments that I
would end with is that the intelligence

1678
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:48,620
process consists every quirements
definition

1679
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:53,470
you have to know what you need to know
why collection management you have to

1680
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:54,530
know who knows

1681
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:59,840
and and how to go get it source
discovery and validation i mean to us or

1682
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,500
should be like it artwork for you know
the Providence if that source you know

1683
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:05,690
the biases in the personalities and

1684
01:50:05,690 --> 01:50:10,510
and so forth multi-source fusion
compelling presentation

1685
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:15,820
timely actionable delivery on this is a
process that is not secret

1686
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:19,559
and the problem that we have right now
is most people are not doing

1687
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,690
rigorous intelligence process and most
people are not doing

1688
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:26,860
rig research discovery and integration
they're basically doing fly by night

1689
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:30,700
you know quick as he can. stuff and so
they're missing a lot and most people

1690
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:33,320
are not working in the war the one
language

1691
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:37,219
and so when you go look at the view the
Spratly Islands

1692
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:42,170
my vision is I wanna see the Philippine
Vietnamese Chinese and Australian

1693
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:47,540
views on any different issue on one
screen alright just

1694
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:51,060
going back to saying before in reference
to re

1695
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:54,960
things being suppressed in the last
year's example about which apparently is

1696
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:55,830
accurate from

1697
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:59,530
I could is back this far because the
sixties

1698
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:02,599
date figured out of all things a dental

1699
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:05,880
decay back vaccine that pretty much stop
it

1700
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:10,330
forty started it was pure ever call it
festers we're talking about it the other

1701
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:11,820
things it was known

1702
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:15,429
was documented Annika totally swatched
because with

1703
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:19,410
pretty much kill a helluva lot of
business for dentists you learn about it

1704
01:51:19,410 --> 01:51:19,980
after that

1705
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:23,670
another example of freedom from but
before the debates whatever

1706
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:28,230
well let me let me take that big is it a
really raises two points the first is

1707
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:31,890
then home

1708
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:37,690
the the whole issue of fluoride in water

1709
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:42,200
yeah I didn't realize separates it's
like it's like in alone on

1710
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:46,670
waste product right and and

1711
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:50,530
okay and so so you know why I am we
figure this out this number one number

1712
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:51,920
two

1713
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:56,030
from the tomato growers just work up in
arms over

1714
01:51:56,030 --> 01:52:00,230
over efforts to control the amount of
illegal immigration that they

1715
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:04,710
were exercising but eventually they
develop tomatoes that could be processed

1716
01:52:04,710 --> 01:52:06,220
by machines and

1717
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:09,390
everybody advanced here

1718
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:12,690
and so mmm I think

1719
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:17,090
I think we really underestimate the
adaptability of individuals we

1720
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:19,950
underestimated after bility of society

1721
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:23,099
enemy machiavelli had every right
although there's much about machiavelli

1722
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:23,910
I don't like

1723
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:26,930
when he said that on the

1724
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:31,050
the people who were touting new methods
have no supporters

1725
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:35,560
where is the people who were beholden to
all methods have all the supporters

1726
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:38,730
and so is it really is a crisis that

1727
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:42,910
that is needed and that's why the
Chinese revolution for crisis is also I

1728
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:47,260
think a symbol for revolution i mean for
opportunity

1729
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:51,060
so I I don't know I I've got this now I
know what I

1730
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:54,600
do I've got one of these for everybody
in the room okay

1731
01:52:54,600 --> 01:53:00,050
if you don't have a on it's a membership
card 58 Ohio to

1732
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:04,460
girl and and the troll principles from
the sun sea on a

1733
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:09,120
Institute around the back and the first
one is motivation based on love and I've

1734
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:14,590
worked my way up to number two which is
really important an attachment outcome

1735
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:19,450
I really think that no matter what
happens it's gonna be okay

1736
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:24,340
and we're gonna figure it out and I
would bet on humanity every single time

1737
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:28,080
incidently actually done before it
actually the worst you may realize

1738
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:31,519
because first awarded in studies in
other countries which naturally in the

1739
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,870
water if it went down there wasn't

1740
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:37,680
yep they found little if any difference
in in dental decay all timidly

1741
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:41,090
as wind and it gets worse because

1742
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:44,710
the want meeting about for that your
bones to and teeth to take

1743
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:47,890
up instead of summer the calcium which
belongs there now

1744
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:51,140
florida is harder but it's more brittle
soap for

1745
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:55,470
so even if there was a slight
improvement indicate which really isn't

1746
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:58,640
you end up with teeth and bones that
break easier

1747
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,770
is pretty much agreement back

1748
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:05,460
no up

1749
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:08,690
of point

1750
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:12,660
quite quite quite a bit it's definitely
nasty business it's highly toxic not in

1751
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:13,590
others they use

1752
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:17,010
the said what if there is any benefit
its its in all rates would get the

1753
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:17,560
benefit

1754
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:20,670
drinking in water is just more on it

1755
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:24,440
period it's a toxin it doesn't help
inside the body anyway

1756
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:27,640
big scam with get the idea to scam

1757
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:32,240
K if you will do me a favor let me get
to the front door

1758
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:36,679
so that I can give each review one of
these the membership cards with the CIA
