1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:05,020
%uh saundra Amrhein I did our kismet and
I'm in charge the WiFi network here hope

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,160
and our et cetera and I recommand

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,480
hospital attorneys in the tools he makes
to do bad things to you

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,619
good people of fun stuff

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,550
nice to be loved all rights are going to
start with a quick overview better to

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,759
live network for people to our floor
with them

7
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,189
about how a bizarre defended already a
bit gonna believe near 211 and then

8
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,119
we'll talk to our

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,710
turn little or abilities in June ever to
think my hijacking

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,890
are messing with layer 7 and up arguably
wearing a twenty break people

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,379
%ah a not directly from their chin which
is really fun are advanced misery that

12
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,760
we can inflict on clients

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,000
and then our time for Q&A and will
probably seeking a couple snarky

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,439
comments about Google along the way

15
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,750
I'll probably here

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,339
%ah

17
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:00,650
so for those air probably should already
be familiar but

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,360
it eleven want to play for 520 gigahertz
I love

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,380
a/b/g/n you also the letters the other
that their

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,229
out there were actually up to double
letter so I believe the latest for

21
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,259
prospective able to 1180

22
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:16,270
wake me when i get a DD

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,990
nom for just came up with that

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,899
I'll but basically every radio that's
out there

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,340
way every never heard basically had is
the same radio they can receive

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,440
signals from any network so it's really
really easy to interact with the stuff

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,340
om like its frequency hopping self which
is a lot more expensive than a little

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,810
more

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,220
scare generic wifi card pick these
things up for like 50 bucks

30
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,850
for I can really be someone out feel
Sony taiwanese job shops

31
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,159
a in Vegas and 50 bucks you doing all
sorts of

32
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,590
s things so for example a Bluetooth
isn't really any more secure

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,320
for the promise that you can buy a five
dollar Bluetooth adapter in sniffing are

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,590
so you cannot but then I mean there's
ways to attack Bluetooth are

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,330
Mike Coffman has given talks another
concert a look at some of them

36
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,079
are on ways for about fifteen hundred
bucks you can sniff an attack which was

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,819
very easily

38
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,900
fun a but otherwise it's hopping all
over the place and you can't keep up

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,730
with it with our

40
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,010
consumer cards Baudelaire initial other
wireless weekends

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,590
I love basic has benefited expected to
get your management

42
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,400
defines you the network name what crypto
level there is an intensely advertising

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,239
administrative

44
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,540
crap connecting I control you know

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,849
as connections going on just how to help
power saving

46
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,649
noticable an interesting so they're data
this is where Google's getting there

47
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,989
crap ago on the actual day to raise the
actual I guess they're going

48
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,389
you note the normal day to be stuff so
yes remember

49
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,639
you don't wanna get sued don't sniff the
data packets I just don't admit to it

50
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,129
that so the idea told management frames
know that if I network %ah name

51
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,309
are defined the crypto options are they
define a

52
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:06,430
how often the network advertises itself
are they control Klein access from for

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,909
the client goes in his mid frame I wanna
join EP goes

54
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,340
you're allowed in or go screw yourself
are the authenticator not interrupted

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,569
that's great idea yes I'll look into
that on a later revision

56
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,939
are they are working on an extension
that encrypts

57
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,540
her middle finger but advocates some the
management packets

58
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,010
over it still doesn't indicate all of
them and you still need updated drivers

59
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,569
for everything before that happens

60
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:35,340
and a yeah I don't think it happen to
them the difference they contain a

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,719
data counts of evident are they could be
there to encrypt it appears web

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,858
archive UPA are it might not be it could
have been wearing corruption cuz its

63
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,809
a data frame its whatever people took
over it could be tell that it could be

64
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:48,589
SSH

65
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:54,769
for is hoping for tellin also WiFi
devices are they typically present your

66
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,930
computer at nato 23 Internet device like
was a wire device

67
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,930
are you can put Sep mistress mode on
them but it doesn't really mean anything

68
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,059
a what happens is kind of random some
drivers kinda give you data packets some

69
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:10,849
don't and if you're on are you only
gonna get really did a package addressed

70
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,749
to you

71
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:15,849
or definitely we did have it from your
network you're only going to get the

72
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,260
data frames you can see management and I
can get you to 1100 nothing gets in a

73
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,978
little headers

74
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,400
to get a good stuff yes it pretty much
useless you can turn it on

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,840
it might be yeah I wouldn't bother are

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,060
so what we do have is monitor mode
armored cars are special

77
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,240
are supporting the drivers which most
and 1x do are most in the st. do

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,910
few in Mac do and there's only one

79
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,640
public it is only one driver in Windows
the public interface that you can use

80
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,940
which is the case and he kept which
means you have to buy a car

81
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,390
so don't use Windows easy solution also
this %uh

82
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,229
monitor mode switch it to a two to 11
for the deal with tax would actually

83
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,270
said a report Ethernet packets that used
to be why was it now reports

84
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,909
straight wireless back to get all the
headers you get our you get some custom

85
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,790
single header sometimes so you have one
antenna came in on

86
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,300
how strong it was one including speedy
arrived at iron bars

87
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,910
working drivers were parts for the
firmware almost all former supports it

88
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,600
except

89
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,890
are typically mobile devices are have
really small from wherever

90
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,969
monomer which sucks for people once no
cell phones

91
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,360
why would you ever on it now you never
wanna

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,720
subtle sniffer device are some on
emotions of eczema radio million packets

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,060
data packets control pain

94
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,180
everything are almost everything sports
says up

95
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,170
recover that are so we get all packets
for normal network regardless the

96
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,690
encryption regardless of if there's
clicking on the network

97
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,670
up his cooking doesn't work are theirs
you can detect clients

98
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,970
so you can see who's talking on the
network you're looking at are you can do

99
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,170
it. yes functions with that where you
pass an observation

100
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,470
implicate a front-line attacks like your
be kept for up to

101
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,910
aircrack

102
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,240
up service K back packet format you got

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,640
your header which is completely in a
crib is here to enter from addresses and

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
everything

105
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,810
on the late can vary on based on a tape
a packet

106
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,110
metal frames are all better there's no

107
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,840
data portion to it the whole thing was
cool is that they were supposed to be

108
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,830
just capturing that stuff which kept me
from

109
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,050
information they needed for their cue
mapping

110
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,280
think I'll but day

111
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,290
something happened they were recorded
more initiative

112
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,690
yeah the idea behind workroom was trying
to do what you're trying to go

113
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,060
I can see these 10 mac Address is are
you call that people will say I see them

114
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,370
actresses who goes well we've got from
our Street View car that these 10 mac

115
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,290
Address is mean

116
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,610
you're probably within this 404 trees so
you don't have to turn on GPS

117
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,160
and get better positioning them from the
cell tower would be instead it was when

118
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,730
they were gonna log all your data

119
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,420
anyway and above the government's
subpoenaed from us so that

120
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:59,420
other people from work at sad face

121
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,610
they're basically the defense can be

122
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,340
uninterrupted they can make returning on
thanks for the network a

123
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,770
83 normal wired networks that has

124
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,580
source and destination so is it 11 him
off the left-field spending on

125
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,330
various factors but source client it's
the usual stuff back and forth

126
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,710
de soto agreement to settle for mac
address it says and this is the AP on

127
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,570
coming from

128
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,300
otherwise it looks more or less likely
for net that's very interesting ability

129
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,860
which will show you how to do terrible
things within a few

130
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,230
a roaming basically

131
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,630
with Romi got a lesson AP the same SSID

132
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,310
client figures that know if I'm are the
same you network Lee

133
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,980
no never smelled the Lexus global
network for

134
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,000
previously joining us the other
previously julie night here

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,730
this must be the same network so I'll
distill over the settler

136
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,900
all is right with the world the not
always

137
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,370
but basically rose to the strongest
signal this is rolled it later

138
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,510
um if it's a proper system

139
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,870
support and of on the jersey back
controller something calling on the

140
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,600
the network that knows okay you're going
from this

141
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,790
AP over here in the Old West Wing to you
this morning Bernice

142
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,190
so the only difference here between as
access point is the mac Address

143
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,590
also financial other network with us
ever

144
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,690
trivia on over to really noisy ten times
a second ago I'm never come talk to me

145
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm

146
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,630
awesome on a network over and over and
over again you networks that are you

147
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,960
know

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,060
someone set up a weird broken network
that only talks data and doesn't begin

149
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,190
as in some enjoy never gonna see them
you can't even talk to you know it's

150
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,610
there

151
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,530
there's no way to buy data networking
still have to be able to 11 victory

152
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,670
let's go to disclose its presence yeah
even if you manage shooting

153
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,670
what rewrite be able to 11 little packet
formats enough that

154
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,170
common cards can't see them you can
still see an RF transmission spectrum

155
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,380
analyzer go up there's a big spike and
it's got the same what Obama hopes that

156
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,689
a

157
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,210
11g has in the radio profile someone's
messing around of

158
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,150
clients also are constantly looking for
network to join I'll tell us every

159
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,590
network they'd like to join

160
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,680
%uh if you have to see if I could save
unlike the windows preferences for

161
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,490
preferred networks

162
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,350
most know if we're not careful you're
never too late to start going to the

163
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,190
left again with Michael not working with
my company network

164
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,850
they'd be really really noisy when
you're looking for network that they

165
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,520
can't find

166
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,300
oh and he really noisy though some other
weird ass SAT's that they're looking for

167
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,510
like I really wonder what people are
connecting to your name in our own

168
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,040
networks was on the ground I say

169
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,040
philosopher sniffing you are very much
to put the car in monitor mode which

170
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:38,930
requires

171
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,160
mention the other proper drivers and
support are if you

172
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,500
are a die-hard Windows or Mac person and
don't have a card that works

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,960
a backtracking 10+2 are too good of live
CDs are not required format your hard

174
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,880
drive for proper them in employment

175
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,040
on harsher TCP down

176
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,010
yeah you can play larger roles yep &
Company does all that for you so what's

177
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,140
the right now we've got a pretty good
idea to 11 security are you think

178
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,920
you know after eight or nine years we
stop having a talk every convoy WiFi

179
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,540
security

180
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,579
but you know become self-employed are so
we've got a good idea about doing

181
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,640
network security now in

182
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,340
known security professionals you can
build a secure wifi networks now that

183
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,010
I've noticed professionals in quotes

184
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,590
yeah but even even random

185
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,900
people are kinda moving in aggression on
that which is up

186
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,130
%uh you know five years ago we see maybe
ten percent

187
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,800
encryption with web yea of now we're
seeing you know fifty percent could wear

188
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,650
I am you know maybe thirty or forty
percent actually compete with WPA PSK

189
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,990
it's a step forward people kinda getting
the clue I after a decade of news

190
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,140
reports people on Fox News that you know

191
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,810
some guy in black in a free report are
going we see if this person's life I

192
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,860
was not on their front door and talk to
them are people finally think it's a

193
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,180
good idea to encrypt the ship

194
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,400
now as a little side note how many have
you gone

195
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,160
I S key provided but DSL routers are the
kittens

196
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,100
home yet yep yeah

197
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,210
okay so yeah people by SAP the one out
%uh

198
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,640
you've probably seen your YouTube
interior files the 2012 network

199
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,490
with the SSID is five characters numbers
and letters

200
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,290
yes on fun fact that on

201
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,849
all but two characters on the web key in
base 26

202
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,860
so you can read that number to be

203
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,270
26 and you too and the other two by two
big other web key

204
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,410
borrowed the only wifi to the
manufacturer

205
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,050
who makes the router Actiontec how many
metres is that they have elected them

206
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,040
6 so we can just capture capture data
packet guess the year

207
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,660
guess the keynote April 61 C two matches
out as African for kids but that doesn't

208
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,390
automatically

209
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:57,390
good I'd whistle innocently but I'm
afraid to do with the back again so just

210
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,569
imagine I did BI

211
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,700
late I'm up in Canada in Alberta and I C

212
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,500
so many of these rare the centre Ave
ISP's in the Tellico saying

213
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,320
well here's our new secure free home
router with web

214
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,060
thanks that's

215
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,530
better whatever it is

216
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:27,520
yeah because of the wifi securing proper
deployment so we'll be my problem

217
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,670
WPA enterprise are you preserve
medication for years working

218
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,010
if you really hardcore you per user
certificates I bet u certificate

219
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,980
authority

220
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,900
validates them automatically as they do
assign how many the official tried

221
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,980
rolling your own and was gonna system

222
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,150
on it so easy you 5 system

223
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:52,829
to start with have you gotten into work

224
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,430
I see one guy in back yeah to I see two
guys in back

225
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,360
no I don't scrapped or

226
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,560
for I I'm sorry for freeradius kick my
ass

227
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,020
well when you get to set it up for me

228
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,120
so we've got a pretty good cryptosystem
for WiFi now

229
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,339
are ATF is not broken yet I don't know
very

230
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,390
working flaws against how and how it's
used on wifi

231
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,180
article showing floss our ticket was
made if

232
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,660
about I think the they felt they they
were spec about six years ago in in the

233
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,760
spec they said

234
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,880
the we expect this to be valid for about
five years

235
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,540
before someone to cuddle billion and the
about a year ago

236
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,000
someone searching going to listen to get
and it was within a couple of months

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,160
when the when the it was ratified some
good estimate also

238
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,760
get off ticket movie CCMP pretty much
everything up their support that so

239
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,220
yeah is a few like handheld devices and
phones one other don't support system

240
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,730
because they don't have the horsepower
to do it

241
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,829
on so get rid of them are

242
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:05,160
here people eventually fall down it's on
its way

243
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,209
up I haven't seen anyone have a out of
the box quick attack against

244
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:12,850
yet but I think it's quickly going the
way of where and in the next year or so

245
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,430
we're going to CVS for

246
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,440
but after the BP oil prices secured on
correct

247
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,079
opportunities billiards in opportunities
for fill your existing users don't

248
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:21,950
validate certs

249
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,230
or if you just let you say okay cuz they
make great decisions all the time

250
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,560
no charge for so much case in point

251
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,310
%uh I gave a certificate for the hope
network to the info discuss how many

252
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,760
people validated that if you're using
the WB network

253
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,930
yeah so

254
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,940
arm theoretically it's not that hard to
brief wpa2 network that says its

255
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,070
your network with a certificate and if
your users can say

256
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,399
here that's fine 11th no:

257
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,290
this actually works it's proven very
useful in a few tests

258
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,449
so there are ways to do it but if you
have talking like a corporate sense for

259
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,440
you can control you

260
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,310
the laptops you make your neck %uh

261
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,050
also defending the AP been doing this
for a long time now are the best defense

262
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,610
is a strong network architecture yet you
can toss it

263
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,440
big deal to toss its radio it's made to
be dost

264
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,570
are you can monitor for conflicting
instant access points

265
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,790
are you can Nordic like Mixview
therefore develop lying when it connects

266
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,930
to an AP that you don't control your
well that's not right

267
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,949
kick it off at your own DoS attack trial
you can park in reply traffic at the AP

268
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:31,199
are depending on its strong effort is
easy cuz you can go well

269
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,630
all your crypto goes for me cuz you have
per using key so I can control who you

270
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,320
talk to

271
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,850
are Howard if any part of Libyan very
hard to

272
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,260
impossible as well discuss other no
service attack as a friend for a

273
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,689
protected you through the AP

274
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,699
get everybody off PFT who cares %uh

275
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,640
your children I'll I mean growth
download the specs

276
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,020
from Lady a different way people and you
can just stop the entire spectrum in

277
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,689
Oblivion

278
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,520
are the only real difference in this
program first do it at the crowbar to

279
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,399
stop doing it

280
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,770
and you stop the non-serbs attack that

281
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,730
really all that matters Austin I love
attacker year

282
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,310
it basically pushing it a little bit

283
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,510
is absurdly easy you know the city

284
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,060
radios capable talking to these things
stuff

285
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,240
on manager frames totally unprotected

286
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,449
we could see who is talking to you know
which client server talking to the

287
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:30,880
interesting corporate network for those
ones at the coffee shop

288
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,899
on open networks are on a dedicated I
have no idea

289
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,420
if that coffee shop networks actually
the coffee shop network courses some my

290
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,390
friends around it was probably not but

291
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,600
sector with the shared media anything
you said oh it's a radio with the big

292
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,190
bubble

293
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,589
love energy to get said every goes out
in all directions

294
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:54,040
so if I'm anywhere in that I can't step
the traffic that's going through their

295
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,560
it you know well the on walls parking
lots whatever avoiding a possible

296
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,589
networks require smart users

297
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:06,660
I haven't won yet have you

298
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,700
I'll users typically make bad decisions

299
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,740
if there is plate the wrong option to
choose that's the one they choose

300
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,000
I would you like to be set on fire yes
yes

301
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,540
um the OS OS's don't help up

302
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,190
when does in particular likes to just
hop on networks it seen before it

303
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,420
figures oh yeah I've

304
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,800
been ongoing since before world on
alexis obviously the same network

305
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,280
absolutely it's hard to tell

306
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,160
what's real assuming that these are even
looks they're just the owner free

307
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,380
internet immediately

308
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,010
I've seen a few cases today before that
the network was up a guy standing next

309
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,000
to the window it

310
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,500
you know downstairs on the second floor
laptop up to the window

311
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,490
you know trying to get onto something no

312
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,680
this is basically what you're doing free
candy

313
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,060
must be good let's go inside was correct
will even give you a puppy

314
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,830
if for

315
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:13,250
is pretty close a car to render so %uh
for example users really like free wifi

316
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,940
who wouldn't want to join up name free
public wifi you seen it

317
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,870
she was then begin registration
yesterday and some guy was standing in

318
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,860
line at your comment of

319
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,360
ok free public wifi when available hey
he and I smiled to myself and walked

320
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,789
away

321
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:34,610
so sometime long ago

322
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,760
in for gotten times is never probably
just that there's probably some

323
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,129
you know airport or something Adam made
few public wifi

324
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,350
so fun fact our windows I think they
finally fix se7en sp3 on XP

325
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,700
but for a long time but couldn't find a
network said i cant find this network

326
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,190
that you want me to connective obviously
you want me to make an ad hoc

327
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,830
at absolutely perfectly logical

328
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,439
what I didn't want to do tonight I have
never being advertised

329
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,880
for free public wifi maybe a little icon
next to the southern at heart but

330
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,179
know that icon is action don't even his
windows

331
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:14,149
so and some girls trying to join in also
doesn't go anywhere

332
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:17,230
so then they now have a preferred
network a free public wifi

333
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,679
so its except as with an ad hoc from
I'll come back

334
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:23,690
I like free public wifi tries joyner and
it doesn't go anywhere

335
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,190
however preferred never gonna iraqis in
same thing happen to the college campus

336
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,230
with HP Setup

337
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,760
were some kid fraud ladies P printer
with WiFi into the dorm

338
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,520
and you could almost watch the wave of
it over the course of a day

339
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,270
spread over nine stone worktops a 94
dormitorio

340
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:45,639
everybody Windows machines could be over
teach be set up so I'm not a joke ad hoc

341
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,750
network it doesn't go anywhere you can't
do anything with it

342
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,000
almost a quarter probably never be the
same name handed out IP addresses which

343
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,440
would make a slam local

344
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,640
for the fire or domain for the Windows
machines that connect to it but

345
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,640
no one would ever do that that seller
for

346
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,870
ok let's really really trusting

347
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,980
if you say your network you must be
right it's really hard to avoid this

348
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,560
happening

349
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,570
up even for us it's really not gonna
from

350
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,159
if the Open Networking from mac Address
you can tell are

351
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,260
remember before Roman however how it
works you

352
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,379
you you have to believe he's in the same
name they have different back addresses

353
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,550
and it or not to jump to the strongest
signal mmm

354
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,980
fun so you get mostly the same SAT

355
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,990
find us on the SAT is one big comment
network

356
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:44,990
one big happy family rose to the
strongest signal a

357
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,360
out seven attackers stronger radio AP
meaning

358
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,980
I'm sitting right next to you but the or
you know went and bought up to 100 know

359
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,030
what wifi card

360
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:59,670
nobody here has any those no moscow's
the left after being holed up in front

361
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,050
row

362
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,990
for for you may not be charged if you
think your doctor a

363
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,120
and as long as packets go through kitten
meow is won't notice

364
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,620
a you're the man in the middle you will
own everything on my connection

365
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,940
you win automatically are

366
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,750
snatcher to interface attacker play get

367
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,910
USB and PCMCIA or the on-board wifi you
get two air bases

368
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,300
one connects a legitimate work at the
coffee shop or what have you

369
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,070
on the other one is sitting there with a
nice 300 know what

370
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,389
guard the antenna statement on it

371
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,350
advertising free public wifi or appeal
for ducks

372
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,360
and fish since you're sitting closer to
the AP because there wasn't a very

373
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,670
nothing somewhere in the ceiling and
nobody ever knows where the hell it is

374
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,870
you get a stronger signal their own you
you know bridge that connection back

375
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,110
a gotta love traffic flowing through you
how kind

376
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,800
arm some pretty boring have to make a
big network for

377
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,910
every single one of these you know
potential coffee shops are

378
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,060
what to do all of them so we've got
karma an air base for two wonderful

379
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,820
tools for this

380
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,419
it basically says yes I am at network to
any and all

381
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,910
requests

382
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,260
this help the only see that this
statement public wifi

383
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,710
yeah let's make are you you know
Microsoft yeah that's me

384
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,220
for 0 when you the network

385
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,730
your the Internet after on the Internet
I have to own your internet

386
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,280
yeah I miramax over that stole the IP
love it arm

387
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,399
you talk to the Internet repair for
bargains good I get locations offer yet

388
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,890
update yet you've got an update imagine
that

389
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,990
I don't know they all came out at the
same time here random binary

390
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,520
order to produce a program called evil
grade which is designed to take

391
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,530
followed the dollar bill all the network
services in Windows and Mac

392
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,420
that take updates that arent signed
digitally like with this is our

393
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,580
s other than they are in computer sign
and up

394
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,159
give you custom binders happened run as
admin updated up to each other

395
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,960
good teacher so what happens when you
mix this with Metasploit

396
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,380
Curtis plates as later base

397
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,190
basically yeah it's you connect to air
basic issue

398
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,690
an address and it feeds you every single
browser exploit no demand for Metasploit

399
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:30,520
here have a faceful exploits it's almost
like secret login

400
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,340
but they don't trip session argue with
former was not guilty of this until very

401
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,909
recently

402
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,960
are already your anyway are so

403
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,340
you what's on Krypton out session
cookies your email data

404
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,790
et cetera also the middleware SSL sniff
Cookie Monster all hijackings cookies in

405
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,540
my view in its

406
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,790
whoever you capture I was kinda boring
them because they're really obvious

407
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,210
people Dunham but still get some use it
but we really obvious if any was looking

408
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,670
for this that something's going on

409
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,080
I think the points are awarded for
stoller at least still so I'll wait a

410
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,679
minute did we say to 11 is your beauty
network and we did

411
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,920
we found a great time machine and the

412
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,060
is not to be too good a time machine

413
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,960
%ah

414
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,840
well it's a time machine or get to bring
back awesome weapons from the future

415
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,730
yeah also the bad old days in the you
know early nineties hair metal grunge

416
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,170
ripped jeans I switched your beauty
internet-savvy tire segment

417
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,360
is the session attacks a fun diversion
when I get an early version is talking

418
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:32,940
porn

419
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,840
and we got to the slide my forever there
early for the late 80's early 90's

420
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,669
another

421
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:43,670
oh no communism good friendship the
provided them communism

422
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,580
some other time you never be that easy
right I mean people gone smarter since

423
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,500
the 90's right you never take a system

424
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,560
from a secure network to completely
insecure shared media network

425
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,560
for anybody to session hijacking right
group

426
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,280
airports James hotels conferences

427
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,280
for sale I mean everybody in life I know
today's election for robert mitchum

428
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,190
friends have no protection

429
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,890
open networks have no client protection
nothing stops scooping the AP and

430
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,150
talking directly to the client we don't
even have to be

431
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,190
not to bring up forty we don't have to
be can we just have to use a data frame

432
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,920
from the smack addressed to you

433
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,560
accepted so you can try to filter input
into my communication

434
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,429
on the AK are doesn't work on open
networks cuz I know the AP talking to

435
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,010
your AP doesn't get making a decision on
whether whether not attack against her

436
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,650
also you have to do is generate $11
header from the AP mache address

437
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,500
to the quiet mac Address the client
think the package which it may be a new

438
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,860
opportunity to do anything about it

439
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,320
we communicate directly with protected
fights airports perfect

440
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,350
so are doing this

441
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,340
most boring card use of Mac players on
it means most of the wifi code is off

442
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,140
loading the operating system this is
good for us because it means we can make

443
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,740
packets

444
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,740
are over cards like prison to did most
of it in the hardware

445
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,960
which meant it was a real big pain in
the ass it didn't work very well arm

446
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,970
unfortunately there are any real good
standards for that every offerings love

447
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,700
differently

448
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,060
different drivers do differently family
custom headers per packet

449
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,110
so just write my when hey this sucks
running thin coat for every app

450
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,360
earthing code for every different app
sucks ready custom code for the driver

451
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,290
saw three body for recovering from sucks

452
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,460
primitive thing called work on probably
doesn't suck unfortunately we're going

453
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,280
from suck

454
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,620
%uh so we have work on 2g

455
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,990
new API Mottaki cap it's really easy to
use you see the movie AVI

456
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,630
are right now it supports our other 1x
cards little support be a reference of

457
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,080
work on wanted soon

458
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,770
the euro BB and so don't worry about it
%ah

459
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,900
so I magnin terms driver now to make the
figures are the

460
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,530
the virtual network interfaces for
injection mode are you cannot reply to a

461
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,530
little packets for the fact that simply
API

462
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:04,470
built into it no skip over this
conundrum

463
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,910
little short are so the inspiration for
all this fun wifi session hijacking

464
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,090
about five years ago approach the puter
airborne

465
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,490
I'm and you to stop rocking back and
forth or something to keep running the

466
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,620
feedbacks on here

467
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,880
about five years ago was going to go
through airborne are

468
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,610
which is TCP stream I got many total 11
why has everyone been using this

469
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,070
ever since it is fun as hell if awesome

470
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,010
and it's not just for shock porn anymore
if you don't get it

471
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,230
ask the person next to you will be happy
to explain it to you

472
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:42,230
I division 2 this a diversion was talk
to be some corporate people wanted n

473
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,410
this lady typically raises her hand goes
I didn't get the flight about the coke

474
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,360
can you explain it

475
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,510
yeah and I said I did an internet
connection

476
00:27:53,510 --> 00:28:00,060
for so typically

477
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,679
unaware to attack a that's secure
because you only know that the

478
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,110
UK rich slight negative sequence numbers
in the knowledge in

479
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,580
numbers everything has to come in order
if it doesn't know case dropped on the

480
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,350
floor in return

481
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,300
really busted so as an attacker

482
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,500
if I can see your sequence numbers I can
just go like a couple hundred ahead

483
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,120
Star Trek sitting there and everything
still nicely in line because

484
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm now transmitting further ahead

485
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,120
all the stuff they're still coming in
for the ballot access point just dropped

486
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,760
on the floor because it's now a sequence

487
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,280
so this gets really fun when you start
looking at

488
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,170
United easily sessions you know standard
handshake we're getting a

489
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,790
file from my Google /url whatever help
clients as a server get me this

490
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:53,500
file server back here's a sequence
number you're right nodular

491
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,510
sir Declan here's your editors are
content

492
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,120
after so let's take this

493
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,900
at really rapper will be capital PLC

494
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,180
see a client goes the server request
that H

495
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,750
Metasploit see this and says 0 %uh

496
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,430
yeah I'm now gonna respond much faster
the remote server can

497
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,230
schools two hundred milliseconds away
I'm to millisecond delay

498
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,120
i can reply with secret numbers there in
in line

499
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,800
with my own content bush's content so

500
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,070
yeah here's our content closed session
the Roeser still sending data in its

501
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,419
like

502
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,340
it doesn't care on and then yeah we know

503
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,670
on you we just feed you god knows what
basically with me a

504
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,080
Metasploit there's no module for doing
your phone 10 minutes late

505
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,280
a

506
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,210
a you mix mash which one to replace on
the

507
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,270
mister X you can replace not just a sh t
be under the new place

508
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,940
whatever kinda content you want yet is
that your

509
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,920
asking for Google's front-page image I
responding back with you

510
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,580
go see

511
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,360
the %uh the display version there for
those got the file for matching

512
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,120
specific sites even you fine-tune what
your

513
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,720
content you're sending for specific
sites you know

514
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,190
it basically is that as you want

515
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,960
a so what does that Kenneth it gets us
ATP content

516
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,950
replacement up or other words we control
the dominant role forms we control

517
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,830
browser

518
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:38,840
we can access anything security context
the page with injected something injured

519
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,220
also provides content we do now are most
complex sites

520
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,930
include a whole crapped on oval John's
recover files to get included in the

521
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,570
background

522
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,500
firm to replace one of those well so for
example here CNN loading

523
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,350
$400k JavaScript these are really
attractive but only visible to the user

524
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,840
you never see him get loaded

525
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,500
are would request which means we've got
20 attempts to win this race condition

526
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,700
are any one thing for which remains the
webpage so we can change anything on

527
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,840
that webpage

528
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,920
so I'm reading your dumb the Document
Object Model

529
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,950
it's our programmatic JavaScript
relation to page content

530
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:18,950
13 in the DOM we can do anything we want
to the site

531
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,740
so that nasty little bit code are
basically just goes I'm going to look

532
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,040
for the DOM for anything named CNN

533
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,090
t1 image I and replace that with my own
image

534
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,700
and look for anything since CNN t1 text
in a place of my own text

535
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,800
that's all just you know looking through
that's the source code CNN's page

536
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,220
you can find with the name thanks so %ah
that's really fun

537
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,120
was committed well we're all forms on
page proxy through a hostile server logs

538
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,400
everything at work through

539
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,120
I would read all the crippling summit on
a good page so that your

540
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,350
you might hope you're clicking on his
ps3 for you're not

541
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,470
home before the content topical
conference cunt in 40 headed what if

542
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,480
your banker conference in every

543
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,190
finance website suddenly says the market
crashes

544
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,900
here so you actually have a fake thats

545
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,620
up ship for

546
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,540
I'll a leg up on so I'll

547
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,520
what we're doing here is looking for
everything that begins with a GPS and

548
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,450
direct replacement if you could

549
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,140
a look now nothing's on nothing
preventing more Middle the feature pages

550
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,880
you look at I can offer poison

551
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,510
so this matters a lot note like
seriously seriously matters

552
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,350
up who's right or six paper

553
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,250
about capital I feel like five people
six people and I think some her bf

554
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,380
before

555
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,760
are you can attack if he finds the
cache-control Aussie to wear two attacks

556
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,040
against the weapons than the persistent

557
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,110
so once you leave the area the WiFi
network you're still owned

558
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,330
well short version brothers have cash
cash from into rounds when it does

559
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,610
you don't notice cash owner is the
session I when you cash control

560
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,610
so I could use bikes jobs for files that
cash for ten years

561
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,730
it remains there in three use every time
you visit the site

562
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,020
from whatever network you're on then
like your corporate network

563
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,680
and nobody would ever visit a site that
they visited a coffee shop

564
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,740
backup network Facebook ur Twitter any

565
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,240
you know any site like that never have

566
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,580
overlook $400k jobs for pages that are
cached

567
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,090
so long before files available the end
user we can keep trying to poison

568
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,470
are so we have to do cache-control
header max age womans nine's public

569
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,230
order senator

570
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,280
are some I don't know 2011 that's good
I'm will go into 2012

571
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,840
me what is good with no never i'd like a
comment of the files but with malicious

572
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,420
code set the cash only use goes back to
work because the Twitter again

573
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,750
00 look they're loading are cached on
his profile we gave them with whatever

574
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,720
we put in it

575
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,310
so we'll keep using it every time to
expire so we could put iframes in there

576
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,629
then 20 couple years ago to make this
thing called socket and suck it

577
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,810
suck it suck it suck on implemented TCP
over JavaScript and AJAX

578
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,379
the man is not OK for his part would be
awesome

579
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,040
are so you could use that only corporate
network and then run and map through

580
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,000
on them through their browser are you
could loan you know new brother exploits

581
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,440
meetings are never gonna try to work
though

582
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,750
are also homicides user chin post office
in your own Google

583
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,860
and if we you know poison that to
rewrite every page that

584
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,270
uses that are so sad

585
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,469
are you can also have a cash transfer
file to call home every time the pages

586
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,120
visited

587
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,639
third look at it actually brothers this
week all week

588
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,960
so you know this way for brother all day
and then you know drop a file on your

589
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,790
server that

590
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,929
X that exploits that every system has
the cash jobs for filed its looking for

591
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:43,379
more

592
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,560
pullin exploit the brother in 34

593
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,110
you the same thing the job description
you could make other JavaScript that

594
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,960
then ajax is the original content
manipulates the DOM

595
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,800
does whatever you want to it are new
drug for the lease dumped in their

596
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,450
up I mean I have been developed problems
lately writer that that's old news will

597
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,430
have a real brothers anymore they're
secure

598
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,129
we have two from basically this means
the

599
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,250
a website is innocent you know the old
thing of having to

600
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,560
visit you don't visit evil malicious
website game I get infected

601
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,650
no any website now for an open network
can be

602
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,820
infected also means web sites that don't
ask for like

603
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,720
a lot of people know don't go your bank
on a Starbucks okay but

604
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,050
it doesn't have to be rank and more
anything

605
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,670
so it is also not right use of to be
smart enough not to accept the bet

606
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,490
certificate

607
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,890
uses you never do anything and secure
obviously Britney Spears for CBC her

608
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,730
from

609
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,420
for and you've never make bad choices I
mean I would never

610
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,520
happen there never be anything like that
ago

611
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,090
wonder why we drink told you get
pressing

612
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,140
so-so certificate for obvious to us are

613
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,620
Thunder Thunder signed by Verisign you a
superuser even looks at that

614
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,980
I I i think we would have to click OK
cuz no click OK it ok it's

615
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,820
its report yet no report yet no ok good
I have borne

616
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,220
up don't you can always find a way to
expose themselves but we're smart right

617
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,140
arm wealth but if you remember oxymoron
spikes attack

618
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,509
are yeah that was no that was it almost
one in Firefox

619
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:24,100
and it would be very easy to implement
over wifi using sessions like this

620
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,400
by the exit right yeah

621
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,490
also yeah it was fixed what about the
next one that some were I have a TV in

622
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,780
random number generator thing from a
couple years ago I had almost

623
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,910
and you know nicely exploitable via this
kind of attack

624
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,370
are and a your own you slip up once want
to cast

625
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,450
cash poisons can stay there are often do
you use public wifi on Andrew wifi for

626
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,780
myself for the stalk

627
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,010
it makes me sad part so you know

628
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,730
I'm using VPN or I control corporate
network with an iron fist I force my

629
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,990
youth use VPN

630
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,520
17 fired at them secure this won't work
but it wouldn't accept a brother has no

631
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,080
friggin clue that you're on a VPN or if
you're not

632
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,100
so if you get something cash in a secure
domain already around when you're in a

633
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,890
secure one

634
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,120
so like coming out of the landing page
we have to really you look how many

635
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,740
those running

636
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,210
PS not many for not accepting credit
cards unprepared have an open network

637
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,910
that looks like a good target amid

638
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,640
so I control your pre winding page I
could tell your browser

639
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,379
I can make my friends the back on to do
a check where is that keep looking for

640
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,550
pages I think you're likely to visit in
the future

641
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,150
I have to do is get over the top 500 I
think you're likely to go to

642
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,500
requested in the background and cash
page you've never seen so many go to it

643
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,350
legitimately

644
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,480
it's already own are even better

645
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,590
that JavaScript it's doing that can
inspect the page got and see whether or

646
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,740
not it has the lowest rate we put in it

647
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,890
and if it didn't request again until it
does so we can just keep cranking

648
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,779
through them as fast as we can issue
requests

649
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,840
until we get the attack to land for the
%uh the timing attack

650
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,890
of now we have arbitrary sites that we
won't in cash

651
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:02,540
free vpn we went I one step further ppl
get in front pages doesn't

652
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,960
so we controlled earlier to to tackle
protocols

653
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,960
yeah hey do you know if that's one
packet over you TP

654
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,090
so we gonna DNS query put the QR bit on
it

655
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:16,360
given IP and send it back to you yet the
death toll in Metasploit

656
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,610
a it's in there now %uh same thing as a
air balloon

657
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,210
%um configured cetera matter in DNS
names there too

658
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,600
also a little brother Richard enough
resolution we can guess the present keep

659
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,540
requesting this as many times as we want

660
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,270
what stops us from getting him a beer 69
internet here's my key for Internet

661
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:37,190
here's the content for you cash that for
ten years nothing substantive

662
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,990
are so we you know casual paid another
coat on

663
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,750
internet that says a up get through
internet page

664
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,790
and then send it to me from these
peoples to remote server

665
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,710
and I'll rewrite all that a proxy and
then crawled on the final two weeks that

666
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,640
you can get you over your VPN now and
and for those 12

667
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,650
always in your browser JavaScript

668
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,200
of Bros is a great cuz I they want
things to go quickly so

669
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,550
let's catch the US in the browser to and
most of them do this it really kinda

670
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,470
sucks

671
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,200
so you can preview you can poison DNS
before the 13 p.m.

672
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,620
I and then you can you know control DNS
nameservers of

673
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:18,980
after VPN good times what else has cash
fun fact: last-minute changes on cash

674
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,130
I found this out when they perform
conform 1x and everybody went its fixed

675
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,880
and it didn't work for another

676
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,880
six months ago it has its own cash

677
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,650
the Sony smartphones are now
general-purpose computers

678
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,730
you know really complex president
labor's offer on their

679
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,940
Safari everything else oMG typically for
lower bandwidth networks and very happy

680
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,280
to cache data because the slurp lick

681
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,180
speaking actions course all smartphones
are also connections right now we're

682
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,960
season while

683
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,080
network their own your 3d thoughts right

684
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,650
on Emily I will be able to see their
really

685
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,450
well it's not like the old 3G ever fails
an EMT

686
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,780
over to other wireless services that
might be around here looked up shop

687
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,110
conference or maybe pick up your iPhone
by the

688
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,309
from corner

689
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,640
um smartphone user is to go to wifi

690
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,400
know it'll automatically connected when
I get home and sick their mail or

691
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,900
whatever

692
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,380
they were for our speed whatever reasons
but

693
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,979
you know maybe we can help them along to
go into their wifi things you know it's

694
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:30,259
not like here you can find things not
you should go to empower site not you

695
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:30,930
should buy

696
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,899
illegal cellphone jammer enforce victims
to use wifi mom

697
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,589
and no one would ever do something
illegal to break into your network right

698
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:42,180
I mean that would be wrong wrong here

699
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,799
how is your users or

700
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:49,450
marketing executives carry their
smartphones between yeltsin the airports

701
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,759
J where do I get really bored a lot of
times

702
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:57,069
arm it took me a long time

703
00:40:57,069 --> 00:41:00,210
his there's no manual in an iPhone box

704
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,219
you have an iPhone there's no manual on
the box it tells you how to Cleary cash

705
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:06,640
on a night when you get a drill down to
like it buncha met menus

706
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,950
so does going to clear to

707
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:16,670
TCP's good smarty filtered ACP so that
only authorized servers antidote

708
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,739
um but for talking directly to clients

709
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:24,910
the savings DNS Bush running short on
time

710
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,598
also another phone attack oh he's a
summer trip to appended to stream

711
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,999
said hijacking the stream in the middle
so what does the future look like

712
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:35,259
and and shady stuff from data headers

713
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,519
new online data fin for after we beat
the fin vote we keep controlling socket

714
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,710
we continue reading data

715
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,519
the client drops the the

716
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:47,660
the fin cuz we already accelerated past
that

717
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,299
and of fun fact most runs really don't
care script after if you know

718
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:55,119
and they also don't really care about to
be content like field and know if he had

719
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,559
an okie processing it

720
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,469
are seeking to Pitzer filters by Penny
looking content you can poison sup going

721
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:02,700
from the client to remote server you can
point the point

722
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,910
to the client from a remote server are
things like to give our attack is a a

723
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,339
JAR file appended to a gif

724
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:11,489
our sons it could be a candidate for the
content are

725
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:14,900
how this happens depends on the browser
but if you had a good job exploit you

726
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,779
can text on after Giffin hope the

727
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:20,529
the brothers Java plugin Modesitt are
was asleep confident that way

728
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:24,549
home is kinda but just a little gimmick
cuz being the fins really hard to do it

729
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:25,609
doesn't work very often

730
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,710
mississippi 11 really mad tries to do
the ER the

731
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,749
the mobile data what inquiries per
socket

732
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:35,910
I and can you talk Ashley the stove
works sometimes it's so fun

733
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,328
on work on doesn't Virginia

734
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:42,569
it will our web is easy to EPA is

735
00:42:42,569 --> 00:42:46,680
moderately more difficult for PSK
personal ways to do it if you know the

736
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,469
PSK

737
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:51,769
so PSA's one secret shared by everyone
will get their own

738
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,969
are seventy when they sign in but if you
know the PSK Washington joint you can

739
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:56,349
start

740
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:00,329
curbing the traffic are what comes to
use the BPSK

741
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:04,960
its from another phone call I

742
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,309
left the bar with such ease PSK but
after lots accomplices are

743
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:14,059
it's good now hopefully we'll stop that
trend skip ahead

744
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:17,940
try to have a good time for questions
others authorities were closing work on

745
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,650
on you to pack assembly with that it's
really hard to detect these detectors

746
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,849
not fukin AP

747
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:27,410
most %uh DS's go haters which begins
from the safety I don't know or

748
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,359
know what speaking from a place where I
know that my EP isn't are but to detect

749
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,150
these attacks the ISS know every package
being legitimately sent

750
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,960
and ask people to see the pack in the
air our

751
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,180
if yes can even see it I mean I could be
sitting near you and a coffee shop with

752
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,450
a really low power card directional
antenna and

753
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:48,599
you that pretty much nothing else they
were going to say I'll Wireless ideas on

754
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,130
how much for Chancellor Dr every season
which is packets

755
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,059
so they might see you know a client drug
sending a couple about a sequence

756
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:03,059
errors back but mmm so your list you
have an access point started if any

757
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:03,739
clients

758
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:06,739
really hard to think clients when we let
them go off in the world use crappy on

759
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:07,839
secured access points

760
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,999
so such thing can trust you can't

761
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:14,989
spectacular makes a resident use maybe
bring something nasty back with them

762
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:18,670
others that even for us normal people
don't stand a chance

763
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:25,119
of you may already be screwed who wants
to go drinking you can use a VPN

764
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,859
it's hard for a lot of people but are
you use ssh

765
00:44:29,859 --> 00:44:33,670
again most people are going to you can
force update on your users

766
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,599
easier said than done in policies home

767
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,219
you did not give out laptops you're on a
corporate network lol

768
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:44,579
we pretty much don't have time for this
from a chance i'd get posted our

769
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,699
pretty much WPA have a problem where you
have to distribute the certificate had a

770
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:49,819
time if you're going to do surgery
diversification

771
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:53,808
so how do you get certificates to people
securely you can't put a month ago on a

772
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:55,479
public website cuz I just replaced them

773
00:44:55,479 --> 00:44:58,589
you can you know here run this flash
drive

774
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:02,749
you're done with this offer in order to
configure network already are

775
00:45:02,749 --> 00:45:06,509
so mmm were kinda screwed right now

776
00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:13,509
us to protect yourself I manually for
security to move it around her

777
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:17,339
use different problems for logging in
normal use of you know

778
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,779
use links to Greeley you look and then
for PvP enter your SSH tunnel

779
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:24,239
are barely clearing cache I don't like
that means you tax already

780
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,489
you up never keep windows open between
security domain so even if you like even

781
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:31,650
if you disable caching frozen privacy
mode

782
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,650
if you keep the window open then the gel
strips the resident in

783
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,109
and when you go back to corporate
network still be there running

784
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:41,578
are special thanks to our arse making
random and

785
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:45,660
HTM are toast I just burns anyone else
who I talk to

786
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,058
last couple months developing this and
up

787
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:52,430
I think probably about five minutes hey
five and I just went up

788
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:56,058
so we can handle you know a couple
questions because Mikes

789
00:45:56,059 --> 00:46:00,410
here questions accusations

790
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:04,279
what everyone just stares at us your
shopping

791
00:46:04,279 --> 00:46:10,329
comfortably do a demo on a network we
don't have the stuff setup

792
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:13,640
other question was how does ipv6 protect
against us

793
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,949
up affect this arm not much

794
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:20,009
and we haven't seen enough ipv6 deployed
yet for two

795
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:24,559
be relevant arm I haven't looked too
deeply no ipv6 protects the

796
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,989
the sequence numbers if it does arm

797
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:33,869
I still think probably what four years
of something widespread point to that

798
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:38,269
let you know this is probably question
that everybody knows but

799
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:42,789
what is the legal issue of actually
sniffing packets me know you sleeping

800
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:47,210
the slipping the ultimate packets though
thanks for the question was what's legal

801
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:47,660
replica

802
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:52,009
Kansas appeal to connect our own I do
not yet know

803
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:56,229
love a court case in the US that proves
this one way or another

804
00:46:56,229 --> 00:47:00,449
arm actually literally skills that I
added a new

805
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,930
of you to configure that are not only
doesn't log data

806
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,419
but as soon as text data package from
Kate's so it will look at the mac

807
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,799
Address is a running for a bit and then
throw everything away

808
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:12,930
won't even look at the IP day so

809
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,269
although why have no true legal backing
to say I think that's the safest way to

810
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,549
do it if you're sniffing on networks
that you don't own

811
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:23,469
and you're worried that are production
on it will not look at any data

812
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:27,239
at all we look at the the announcement
frames and control frames

813
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:31,469
arm which I

814
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:33,900
technically there's no way they can say
that that's not legal because that's

815
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,739
what your system does

816
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:37,910
all the time to create that was the
network's near you are but

817
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,229
who knows what sanity has to do with our
legal system

818
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:45,069
arm it's gonna be interesting to see
what happens with who I know who was

819
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:46,670
lawyers said that

820
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,589
yeah we're sorry we did this but
according to the our interpretation of

821
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:50,279
the US law

822
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:54,489
it wasn't actually illegal are but that
hasn't gone to court yet

823
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:58,410
IDR arm

824
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,078
don't put yourself in a situation where
the cops come and get you for sniffing

825
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,239
wifi

826
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:08,009
I think that's what we learned here
today I

827
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:11,849
one more I'm when you were talking about
a smartphones

828
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:15,239
you said you know they have the option
of just using their 3G network or

829
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:15,949
whatever

830
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:19,229
and then so it's just for some of it but
it seems like

831
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,469
I it should be possible given the right
hardware to set up a man in middle

832
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,309
attack

833
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:27,589
and a person's use it the 3G network as
well was the stated that

834
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:33,640
love the 2g yes 3G I believe has not yet
been practical point you can do that

835
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,259
however are Def Con arm

836
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:40,279
Chris Paget from hardware is giving a
talk on doing

837
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:44,679
attacks against GSM are see that or

838
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,809
listen to it when it comes out and I
think there's some new stuff coming out

839
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:51,279
America although I'm not sure so yes
theoretically

840
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:54,690
you can attack 3G it you can generally
say that

841
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,900
sooner or later something like that's
gonna happen so arm

842
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,190
I strongly suspect regional things were
government

843
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,680
actors can go

844
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,200
and and do something to you %uh then
again they can always just subpoena AT&T

845
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,360
impassioned a fiber in San Francisco in

846
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,940
minimal your sessions that way arm

847
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,550
yeah I I think 2g

848
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,480
a is now a formal for a cost that we
could afford

849
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,450
I have not heard a 3G having that yet
but you know

850
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:31,450
if you're doing something secure don't
do it over wireless is there any way to

851
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,830
scan the cash

852
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,420
looking for malicious site contact
israel's can catch all your crap

853
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,880
I mean I

854
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,890
love is what comes to mind first if you
have anything what you're looking for

855
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,940
you can this go to the

856
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,490
to go to your cache directory start
prepping and I can automated

857
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,500
automated arm kron forever

858
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:58,480
day Federal Credit rules that I don't
know any Firefox plugin for anything yet

859
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,620
that look for this kind of thing

860
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,670
although that might be an interesting
thing for someone right we got one

861
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,940
minute sowwy

862
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,260
you're probably the worst question do
you really wanna see standing have a

863
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,510
question about a yr

864
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,170
encryption I'm incursion on Arroyo's
network

865
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,540
is a true there encrypts so there

866
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,610
whose that are not attached for network
can't see it but poster

867
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:25,480
in the network conceive each other's
traffic depends on the type of network

868
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,450
our web users one key that everybody has
and

869
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,610
if you know that work even the crypt all
traffic on the net use it

870
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,900
are WPA on the other hand as per user
keying

871
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,960
so into user traffic on a WPA network
goes to the aid one user group over

872
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,140
there he goes the AP the appt crib set

873
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,609
recruits with the other with the
business users key and send it to them

874
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:51,760
so you even if you know your key
exchange on TV network you can sniff

875
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,980
another user's traffic

876
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,480
because they have a different key a
different tempo rocky our life it's a

877
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,410
PSK network and you know the PSK

878
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:02,129
then you can try to capture their key
exchange and the crib with their

879
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:07,110
come for a key are if it's using Eve
then that he exchanged protected by SSL

880
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:11,450
and there's known current attack other
than owning the SL

881
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,620
so think that's it

882
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,839
they are and we will be somewhere
probably all over the place yet will be

883
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:26,840
around if anybody ever

884
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,740
coming up next we'll be ready now
