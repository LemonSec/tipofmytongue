1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,589
you two billion first time at a midnight
steel will be

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,800
in Tesla not love long love lace here

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,190
it's late arraigned its logical tease
their

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,378
so I'm gonna be talking about today is a

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,250
a mapping the public telephone system

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,050
basically going through finding devices
and a lot's changed since the

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,779
the home ok days when I now days we've
course we avoid and things of that

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:28,359
nature

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,369
I it started

10
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,579
my name's beef I I found it a little
group called tell a freak were but a boy

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,010
can a hobbyist guys

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,339
thank you and I'm I got a couple a books
on the subject

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,969
I'll surround a thing called the open
VMs death row cluster

14
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,360
Kazaa I like old operating systems and
fun

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,760
fun and actually just released a new
piece of software called us a can which

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,980
is more log analysis and correlation

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,059
has nothing to do with the sock but if
you get a chance check it out arm

18
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:04,430
and originally I some

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,610
my up partner in crime on this takeover

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,100
workers again mg Falcon and a

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,320
a 4-2 he can make it so I have not J
Falcon appear today

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,310
so I'm the kinda looks similar plus or
minus

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,380
say a hundred pounds know today so
obvious

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,000
yes yes so arm but anyways he can make
it to the family issues and what not

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,900
and I understand that some kinda doing
it solo alright

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,180
who can identify these devices very good

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,119
I had a feeling this audience might be
able to

28
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,140
identify it now who knows a visa

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,430
right old-school modems and kinda
recapping from the talk that it did two

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,090
years ago

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,700
so a lot of people believe that om

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,880
with these devices the two devices don't
work together

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,780
I K can't be modem over boy where you
have to do it and have really shitty

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,899
connections in the dissident work all
that well

35
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:08,068
actually can it's it's fairly easy to do
I

36
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,599
couple disarray as a really quick and a
brief overview

37
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,609
arm is you have to use and compress
codec

38
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,920
can't use anything I GSM earn G 729
taiwanese in like new law

39
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,349
the provider that you using you need to
arm

40
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,090
I have gooden decent latency between and
preferrably not dropping every other

41
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,590
packet

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,450
this makes a a you can actually cheese
really high speed rates

43
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,480
I you know up to even believe it or not
30 36 and whatnot

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,970
be called a high-speed oh and I'm some
devices like the PAP to

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,810
that we're talking about arm actually
have a set up the axes a for faxes

46
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,610
worried I'll

47
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,900
art night open on your modem you type
ATT to dial the phone number

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,379
bayview up and %uh Star 99 and then to
wait for another dial tone

49
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:57,440
it'll throw the PEAP to ensure murdered
that enables it to work with things like

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
back to Sheen's stuff like that

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,179
so arm you can use that with the modem
is well located

52
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,050
disable things like echo cancellation
stuff like that they can screw up the

53
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:11,420
the modem so

54
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,959
I am entire have a look around the
corner okay so

55
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,450
arm the interesting thing you can do
with VoIP as by you know

56
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,420
back in the day whenever I was a kid I
was born dialing a whole lot in finding

57
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
nifty things

58
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,819
but your account like your Eisley to
your your local calling area there's no

59
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,920
longer the case if you want to die I'll

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,790
Iran nine thousand times it's not an
issue

61
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,030
the one tip is though being arm

62
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,000
a free american in wanting to remain
that way

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,110
use a European provider for those kinda
things because if you know the telephone

64
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,330
company flag you for

65
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,230
dialing Iran nine thousand times you get
question

66
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,959
you're not tied to

67
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
fiscal pots or make you were back then
back then arm

68
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,480
you know you had to buy your phone
number you know for mine and everything

69
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,730
in

70
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,819
your physical tied to that so people
would now back in the day I ca

71
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,349
iraq specially when you know I'll star
69 and stuff like that will call you

72
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,950
back in like why the hell economy

73
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,769
in a longer titania that you know kind
of sucks he can do a little bit more

74
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,489
anonymous leaks or to

75
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,780
n you can also do things like speaker
caller ID

76
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,259
are are so that the remote target
they're calling doesn't actually know

77
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,000
who the heck you are

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,979
and it's super cheap and also keep in
mind if you say dialing was actually the

79
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,210
exception to this rule is iran actually
ironically bomb

80
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,729
the arm accept that when you dial 10,000
numbers are not paying for every single

81
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:43,930
call that you're making

82
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,060
you're only paying for one the cost
supervises or when I call cause

83
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,290
answered abortion in Iran you it
supervises all the time so

84
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,699
be spend a lot of money

85
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,509
oh and another thing too is that arm was
she comes with the caller ID

86
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,830
you know the person your target doesn't
know that its

87
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,930
you know particular you and in some
cases I on certain providers you can

88
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,560
access buffet and I

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,180
are which I'm sure you guys have read
about our kids decided that it would be

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,110
a great things about swapping

91
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,070
to to spoof the caller ID up stand by
any of somebody and say I'm a hostage

92
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,590
situation at a laugh

93
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,900
when the police show up haha with guns
that's not cool

94
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,460
don't do that shit

95
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,739
so you not you can now dial around the
world thousands of phone numbers so with

96
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,150
the common question that I always get is
what do you finally find

97
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,150
all kinds of the last time we show that
building management stuff

98
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,580
and in Glen I we do you know we find
routers we find legacy gear lot of

99
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,090
legacy gear things of that nature

100
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,240
and other things you can do to it with
the two is you know since you have it

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,289
lying around you can dial into maybe

102
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,830
even all Russian BBS is there something
like that just for fun to see what's

103
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,568
going on

104
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:02,020
and you can you know a dialing the Fido
net

105
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,460
or nodes or whatever

106
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,650
so basically this whole thing and apps
that you can scan a big area and it's

107
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,300
super super cheap to do

108
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,710
now member Howard is talking about the
modems everything

109
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,068
praying while nowadays things have
changed a little bit

110
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,860
Azria forget those good now we can do a
lot other stuff the modems actually are

111
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,900
technically very good at voters are
really good at identifying carriers

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,080
and stuff like that but when you try to
identify to home sir

113
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,740
anything he can I have to do this
trickery with the physical modem itself

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,050
well now a VoIP I can take the arm

115
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,340
the up the audio from there the call and
analyze it and look for different things

116
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,830
so like Francis back in the old days
when a beer war dialing you might want

117
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,219
to

118
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,819
look for just carriers but then you
might want to go back and look for fax

119
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,970
machines were that you have to flip the
modem into a different mode

120
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,000
to go back through ups and I have the
dial twice

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,080
the same set well you don't have to do
that with software you can this

122
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,349
have a go through in our you know
automatically analyze it so

123
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,610
but the other thing to sit on a
completely thoroughly the modem because

124
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,660
that why you can do all this canning and
everything is done and software

125
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,830
arm you still need the modem right now
as it stands

126
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,870
to you know plug in and see if they care
is really active over

127
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,759
or what not

128
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,979
so anyways I am i cant really that slow
but anyway so

129
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:36,979
%ah be arm you so all the stuff can be
done in software

130
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,139
oh and another thing that we're trying
to do is actually get ready the modem

131
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,919
altogether there are projects expand ESP

132
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,960
which simple man I modem technology
actually in software so you're actually

133
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,889
doing it

134
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,479
you know from the CPU standpoint in if
we ever get all that stuff working then

135
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,139
you won't even

136
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,990
need physical piece of hardware

137
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,990
now should be pointed out I mean I joke
about

138
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,440
you know dialing Iran and I personally
would never ever do such a thing

139
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,729
and these tools are always use for legal
purposes and

140
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:11,849
yada but you know

141
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,128
so right now there's to typical tools
that arm are

142
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:19,590
are are being used in scan 71 homes
developed by HD Moore

143
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,990
from the mess with project and that's
pretty much all you have to say about

144
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,400
that

145
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,539
mean the guy's an animal is awesome and
I'm his has a

146
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,529
pretty nice kinda burglary for an end to
it arm and another towards courses my

147
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,169
tools Scott I war which the basically do
allow the same thing said just a little

148
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:37,929
bit of a different way

149
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,789
his you know more Q a based minders
maybe a few other things they may

150
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,760
his doesn't do quite yet arm and vice
versa but they're both awesome and they

151
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,069
both work well

152
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,750
and you know some and the last slide I
was talking about house multi-threaded

153
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,350
this means a you can say dial these
fifty-four members co-star 50 threads a

154
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,250
file fifty phone numbers at a time

155
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,200
so you can really blazed through an
exchange these it is your basic setup

156
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,420
shots uva

157
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,069
how arm I wore box works he sees very
straightforward very simple

158
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,060
you enter in your range what not and
well I he also added

159
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,370
was like we could make a nice little
presentations and get reporting and what

160
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,980
not about you know

161
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,410
I'll bar graphs in you know the signal
analysis and whatnot I love

162
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,370
the actual phone calls that took place

163
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,930
which is kinda cool you know arm I
personally am NOT

164
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,399
that interested in looking at the
pictures I just want to know if there's

165
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,810
a modem there

166
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,880
but it is pretty cool and makes very
nice reports if you're doing like a

167
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
security audit or something like that

168
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,279
you can uses kinda output for the
managers who will be like while pretty

169
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,790
picture

170
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,709
so since we're doing this on software
you can detect multiple things I mean

171
00:09:58,709 --> 00:09:59,220
you can take

172
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,959
dialed homes this is the proper this is
the area where the modems really had a

173
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,690
kind of a problem was like

174
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,700
you could do little trickery to get
modems do certain things when I can do

175
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,290
it really really accurately

176
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,010
on software and it's almost the threat
so

177
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,149
if if you're VoIP provider allows you to
do

178
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,649
10 channels at a time you can suck up
all 10 channels make ten call the time

179
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,690
and what this means is as arm

180
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,570
each he was testing that if you have a
block up ten thousand phone numbers that

181
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,670
you want to scan for

182
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,689
interesting equipment being told ok here
or

183
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,600
your arm modems and whatever else that
you might find interesting

184
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,829
with I i think it was fifty channels you
can scan out 10,000 numbers in about

185
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,170
three hour period

186
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:50,349
where that year back in the day would
have taken weeks

187
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,690
and down the bottom for the arm we're
using our fast Fourier transforms for

188
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,290
the

189
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,709
signal analysis so when I get audio and
we actually

190
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:05,709
you now that's a pretty collider that
we're using is called kiss a fifty

191
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,839
I get so here's I wore working now this
particular video

192
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,360
you'll notice and I'll talk about this
little bit more up at the top left

193
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,690
inquiry CC name lookup

194
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,180
are are getting to a little bit later

195
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,500
blobby probably already know what that
is arm

196
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,649
and this is thirty threads are with the
one second delay between dialing

197
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,709
so you know it's it'll take a little
while because I've

198
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,709
obviously it's setting up thirty phone
calls and get away from this call stock

199
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,450
for something to happen

200
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,500
and then we color code all the calls
based on what we found so

201
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,850
green being you know a modem carrier an

202
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,769
blue what a black background at home

203
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,930
so it doesn't work up at that that okay

204
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,029
the CNAME look at going to slow things
down a bit

205
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,750
so now we're gonna do a different type a
scam but we're going to a little bit

206
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,540
faster anne's 50 threads

207
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,230
no time delay and when I can do any seen
a more cups

208
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,389
which he said for people who don't know
what to talk about the CNAME stuff are

209
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,970
getting to you in a minute

210
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:21,019
so ABC can start I'll you know it's it's
it's moving along

211
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:28,019
again so you're waiting on the remote
side note what we're doing

212
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,790
so we got some poems here and

213
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,920
in this case actually this is running
against an axe trick server

214
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,689
that have set up so is actually the ask
sir is playing back

215
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,709
different types of tones and whatnot so
don't go home thinking that there's a

216
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,070
modem at a particular phone number
appeared as if not

217
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:54,110
when okay good

218
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,200
thank you makes so

219
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,690
now if we get on the second screen here

220
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,050
and you can also see down at the bottom
or where it's due in their analysis and

221
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:14,050
dumping out the help

222
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,209
now we can roll through an exchange
pretty quickly

223
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:22,450
that's the idea now

224
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,639
as he said we do some other tricks is
well with the CNAME look up and stuff

225
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,120
like that so if we find a modem we might
have a CNAME

226
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,329
records so that we can say oh that's all
my XYZ law firm

227
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:36,950
whatever you can still use what I wore
the traditional hardware if you want to

228
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,680
use a modem

229
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,279
and do it the old school way that's fine
or if you have I'll

230
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,329
a modem is connected to a network like
you telnet to up certain

231
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:48,420
work to get to a modem you can still use
that type

232
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,220
and you can also take the data that you
got from my war

233
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,940
export input into the war boxy can
create those nice reports and whatnot so

234
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,790
manager happy so basically the weather I
wore works

235
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,529
we start up the main engine starts up
that's where the console is

236
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,550
many start-up threat from think a mother
Forker

237
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,250
which is kinda homage to my my dad stays
at Burroughs Corporation

238
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,079
they had a mother for her project so and
then all the children come off working

239
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,829
children and they all run out and do
their bidding

240
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:23,550
and then report back to the mother like
what's going on and then

241
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,430
whatever they find something they
reported back in all the communications

242
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,449
is done through our 50

243
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:31,850
so there's communication between a
thread in the main engine so they can

244
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,930
kinda communicate with each other

245
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,290
and yeah and so the Wii

246
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,510
we start of each dollar I don't really
care what kind eyler it is

247
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,920
in this case for using VoIP but in the
future whatever you know

248
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,680
we have all the serial stuff worked out
all gonna work the same way so it's like

249
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,630
multi

250
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,459
yeah multi-process kinda environment arm

251
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,550
so and the way that we did home
detection is a little bit different than

252
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,720
more box I mean

253
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,980
he actually does xD did set up like
kinda via configuration file we can go

254
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,329
and put in

255
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:07,220
your arm job characteristics have
equipment that you might be looking for

256
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,350
arm Anna Bligh office stuff isn't Ruby

257
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,130
and on this weed iz me like a simple
text file which is a configuration file

258
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,800
so as you can see their first part the

259
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,839
delimiter is being the pipe symbol is

260
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,130
are just a human-readable what is it are

261
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,980
the second part is what the tell the arm
to the

262
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,399
the main engine like how I found it what
I found

263
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,740
and then the other part is how many
samples to arm

264
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,290
some examples to grab before you
consider it what you know what it says

265
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,480
that it might be

266
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,970
so for instance you know we without a
lot of places where you get a lot of

267
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,209
false positives cuz he would come back
as a light on the modem here

268
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:51,399
but then you go back calling them a lady
with a really high pitched voice for the

269
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,019
answer

270
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,690
and you say oh well damn arm so you want
to grab like multiple samples then you

271
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,959
have the other part with the dot one
that should heart trouble

272
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,310
because we are dealing with a I a lot
kinda stuff so even though I might

273
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,480
supposed to be at 2,250 hurts so maybe
eight year two thousand two hundred and

274
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,519
forty-nine point

275
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,750
8 so you gotta take that in
consideration in the last part are the

276
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,940
frequencies that you're looking for with
them that sample

277
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,870
arm

278
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,670
harm so anyway so still kinda like a
work in progress is something that I

279
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,490
work on

280
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,820
on the side don't have really paid to do
it so I'm

281
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,699
but I pretty much taken the old R worker
dinners this is after

282
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,880
and then started %uh because whenever I
really started writing it

283
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,540
are things are much simpler and there
was gonna they're just

284
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,410
dial one phone number at a time which
does and I even added envoy

285
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,740
into it but it doesn't really make much
sense if you can only dial +1 for number

286
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,889
two times gonna

287
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:52,459
Mexican a view source so our and they
also the code a lot easier to maintain

288
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,160
believe it or not I mean

289
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,790
is set you would think that using IP
threads and do in a multi-threaded that

290
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,589
it actually become more complex in
actuality it's

291
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:04,480
thats ends up being a lot easier

292
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,140
now one thing that from this talk is
Kyle about

293
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,620
as well what how to do this I mean it's
one thing to pick up a block a sickness

294
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,000
say you're doing an audit

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,849
will call it that arm and you have a
particular target that you're looking at

296
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,469
you need before he's dislikes are
throwing phone number that im hoping to

297
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,459
find something

298
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,990
in a dick I do a little bit I rekon and
you do a lot of this before

299
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,880
you are even get started so I am

300
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,559
anyone to file under the radar as
possible you don't really want your ISP

301
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,809
to figure out that you're doing this cuz
they looked old

302
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,030
shut you off then will be looking for
yet another arm

303
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,590
ice be but boy provider I am so you eat
we use things like where we randomly

304
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,620
you know random dial numbers we don't do
a sequential

305
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,049
and random times in between so it
doesn't look as obvious

306
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,820
you know from the get-go and then with
usual tricks like from

307
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,129
I again whenever do this I'm really
action not trying to harass thousand

308
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,919
people

309
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,010
arm so I'll do is also beef the caller
ID is a fax machine

310
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,549
so whenever they get on the caller ID
they call it back in and they'll say oh

311
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,600
somebody dismiss dial the fax number in
this kinda like let it slide

312
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,780
and then one patch that actually even
had in there but arm

313
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,539
never really released for our reasons
are going to arm

314
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:22,890
was that whenever a car and no when the
call would supervise did see something

315
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,090
answer on the other side

316
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,678
he would play an audio recording which
basically the audio recording would wait

317
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,360
for bike just a second and say

318
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,080
0 I'm sorry I've dialed the wrong phone
number I apologize

319
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,149
and then hang up and now way you know
people pick up in like

320
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,559
you hear that and you know you're trying
to be

321
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,770
as under the radar as you possibly can
and the reason that I never left to a

322
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,280
release that patch

323
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,260
is because I was talking to a friend of
mine and he said you have me and

324
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,789
telemarketers are gonna love this shit

325
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,799
and house I contact fuckin hate these
people

326
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,940
why do and then add another friend was
like well it's not really your problem I

327
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,780
mean if its use for bad things

328
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,740
mean so work arm so I don't know I made
a release that portion it wouldn't be

329
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
very hard at it and if somebody else

330
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,980
ended up wanting to do it so arm

331
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,169
again so know your target so I'll

332
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:17,230
I've used and some of its where we've I
found the phone number and then

333
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,110
use Google Street View to find a
businesses that are in the area to see

334
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,470
if they're in the same prefix and you
know so I can come get a layout

335
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,730
up to love the way the numbering systems
work I am

336
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,010
or I mean there's tons of resources are
bells mind

337
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,090
net being one of them where you can go
to and

338
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,370
get lots of information about target's
again is plugging the phone number NEC

339
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,150
down the bottom also serves

340
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,720
and so you can start collecting this
data before you start dialing you know

341
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,610
that there's

342
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,610
other prefixes that this company might
have a phone number and

343
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,000
that might be useful to you like why you
didn't find of a modem

344
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,530
bike or whatever you're looking for what
then say and up down up to 100 numbers

345
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,379
while you might want to look in these
other prefixes as well cuz there could

346
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,100
be something there

347
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,150
I am

348
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,580
I think I just said all that arm so

349
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,610
now I'll this kinda goes back on the
CNAME think so

350
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,780
we can actually start scanning and
looking for information

351
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,668
without dialing a phone number but the
CNAME stuff is anybody have a

352
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:26,669
a decent idea how to do this shoot

353
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,750
exactly nurse their services in one eye
and you can actually use the telco

354
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,640
system

355
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,330
a as well by yeah I write what I love
them

356
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,158
I am so you can kind of skin out and see
who owns the phone number for even pick

357
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:39,460
up

358
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,140
which can be useful like for so I had a
target but I was looking at

359
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,230
and I could scan through the Agassiz oh
these law firm start happening here why

360
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,580
don't really need to dial those guys and
I know

361
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,908
about where the Baucus you know what I
mean arm

362
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:57,240
so will do actually this is known as a

363
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,659
back sweeping as like what you're
talking about arm I

364
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,020
where you can look at you see name
database is this is one that %uh G

365
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,129
Falcon likes do

366
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,409
is actually likes to use arm the %ah the
actual phone that works data cuz he

367
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:10,049
finds

368
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,289
using a CNAME data kinda coming gas a
CNAME

369
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,049
for those either not now is whenever you
dial phone number

370
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,820
well it's mister rota and said

371
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,960
arm when every dollar phone number on
your caller ID display

372
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,090
of course comes up the phone number of
the person who's calling you

373
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,490
but then also comes up with the name and
information the person who's calling you

374
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,000
XYZ law firm were

375
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,360
whatever Judy whatever whoever it might
be

376
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,049
arm the idea here is that you make a
call out but you spoof the caller ID

377
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:45,950
love your target and then you call
yourself on a phone number

378
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,970
that will recognize the caller ID
information

379
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,610
so basic all goes on its bid but
whatever comes back and it does a CNAME

380
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,220
look up at the telco level

381
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,320
and passes you the information out who
owns the phone number

382
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,760
has called back sweeping and she fell
can arm

383
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,549
has a habit a doing this is like
sweeping thousands of numbers and

384
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:05,679
calling himself

385
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,970
this find out what the CNAME information
s

386
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,950
I am so basically what you need is
provided that you can dial out on

387
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,590
do VoIP I ask that will let you speak to
the phone number

388
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,070
and then you have ass trick on the other
side up for something and likes

389
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,450
arm I get the call but the interesting
thing is that whenever gets the call

390
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,929
n I'm you never actually answer the call
you just want the caller ID data

391
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,570
so then you play back either congestion
or just hang up on it so

392
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,280
really the cost to be doing this is
exactly zero dollars

393
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,760
now the problem is is that a lot carries
don't like you doing this cuz they have

394
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,419
to pay with a card

395
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:45,970
dip P I'll when their VoIP providers
they play like a couple a sense every

396
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,559
time

397
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,600
if they is do that and if you're doing
this across thousands of numbers

398
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,059
they get pissed and then you don't dial
through them anymore

399
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,399
so then Jay Hawkins this downing says
I'm just gonna backs move Malibu

400
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,590
because I bet you interesting people
live there so

401
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,970
so he calls the one day says do you
wanna call Mel Brooks today because I

402
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:10,909
have this you know

403
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,309
so a he's got list the in he this does
this

404
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,428
schiff an arm so as you can see I

405
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,289
I you know arm if you wanna call Bob
Newhart

406
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,120
you know a course that can have a
roughed out that in one week Scott

407
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,730
Walker to get bottle calls

408
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,940
because it was talk arm but you can also
so this is like he's on the backs

409
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,510
weaving

410
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:38,510
a I getting the information directly
from the telco in this case

411
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,350
oh yes yes yes you say is the child of
the 80's yeah

412
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,240
I yeah others there's all kinds above

413
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,090
fun stuff that he it's a all makes for
fun phone calls on tell a friend

414
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,260
yes actually you can get about that
about lock bag like

415
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,900
saying he was colleague sky Walker I'm
wasted

416
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,350
you know he doesn't do stuff like that
said actually he's pretty good about it

417
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,140
arm

418
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,529
so um you know and he backs with the
entire mouth area and it took 'em Mike

419
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,150
good forever to do

420
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,080
and now has it like a SQL database and
he was gone there where the

421
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,639
persons name is like this and then
Michael come up in if he doesn't like I

422
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,539
guess call manana

423
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:22,809
I am but and and use doing this method
it's moving the call I'll

424
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:26,320
and and have a call you didn then
looking at a CNAME

425
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,600
is using you get the best results from
by as was pointed out earlier there are

426
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,270
other

427
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,990
companies that actually sell the service
and the reason is there's a lot of VoIP

428
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,770
providers

429
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,970
that will pass the caller ID information
but not the CNAME not the name the owner

430
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,669
so these will companies have started up
and they will actually

431
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:47,799
I to allow you to query their database
and look up phone numbers in the cold

432
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,529
CNAME

433
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,000
I look up databases and 10 arms boxy
name

434
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,130
so you pay them Mike in the ideas that
you know if

435
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,740
your legally but I mean if you're using
at the waste properly supposed to be

436
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,279
used

437
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:03,390
is that you know then you can have on
your caller ID display that bob smith

438
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,210
call you in

439
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,370
and whatever now I'm so

440
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,159
but it's a little bit more expensive so
you gotta pay ten dollars to get onto

441
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,210
service Nats

442
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,100
thats about a thousand lookups but you
can look em up really fast

443
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,289
your force cuz it all in it right upper
or Tina 5

444
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,960
blind code to do obscene a mock-up a
Malibu

445
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,350
and actually what he was doing was doing
it telco and then doing

446
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,850
it do you see name he was like cross
referencing differ databases

447
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,029
and then probably calling them to make
sure it's really

448
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:37,289
bomb but does seem databases they work
pretty good depending on the ones the

449
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:38,150
pic al

450
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,559
some of them are kinda like fake CNAME
databases then that the data that they

451
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,658
have is it right

452
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,000
related to like what the telco hazardous
like pulling

453
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,100
various date of the Internet those
typically aren't as

454
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,179
was good but like boxing team seems to
work pretty well

455
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,279
the results may vary

456
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,380
now I'm so this is accusing from you
know I wanna see name lookup so

457
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,510
we got out of there one method now will
dislike go there in clear it directly

458
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:12,460
and as you can see this comes back Mark
Hamill thank you

459
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,200
I am

460
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,110
yes so the result easy pretty good arm
the CNAME look at the on those in the

461
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,250
video so now I can have to understand
what's going on the video

462
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,690
where was doing that I told your mom the
CNAME look up in the corner

463
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,320
before our were even dials the phone
number he does a CNAME lookup

464
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,399
to like when these databases so he goes
out and says

465
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,289
who owns this phone number and then the
CNAME database comes back and says it's

466
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:38,059
Marc Hamel

467
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:42,580
then we can put that into are are logs
and have more data about like who owns

468
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,289
that I wanna

469
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:47,240
ever find a modem carey is not the guy
or the company that I'm interested in

470
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,070
then arm I I can either skip better

471
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,939
like your look at it later I

472
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,220
be a it it's really easy to do actually

473
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,720
so this gives you all kinds information
on the ranges in

474
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,390
and what numbers to call and where the
fruit might why

475
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:12,500
that up for the be no the information
that you're looking for basically

476
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,650
arm I find from yeah any

477
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,710
sometimes it can produce make it so you
have to dial less numbers to get the

478
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,980
information that you want

479
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,210
sometimes it is and being more as you do
in that regard trying to figure out

480
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,039
stuff

481
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:27,750
I am and I you see as I said I'm I'm I
try to do this

482
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,750
like real consciously so if I know I'm
going after business owner to business

483
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,880
area

484
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,360
a pick up the times like I'll say okay
well they close at six

485
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,330
so I'll start my scanning you know it's
seven because I don't want them

486
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,510
for 1i don't want a notice to all other
phones are ringing at any particular

487
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,610
point

488
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:47,480
and go without strange maybe we should
call the phone company I don't want that

489
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,640
so if they're not there to %um better if
it's like a residential water not to do

490
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,429
it like 3 a.m. cousin your

491
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:59,429
pissing off lotsa people arm

492
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,559
okay so but there's some the way they
were doing it works fairly well

493
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,678
but there some legal problems with it
arm

494
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,090
I'm sure you're alive you guys are
familiar with one party into Carty

495
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,820
party recording and laws that regard
around that

496
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,899
and so like both would mean age do you
do and you can have seen this is a

497
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:18,799
problem is that

498
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,010
when you make the call you're making an
audio recording then you're analyzing

499
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,789
what are your recording

500
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:28,179
its which means basically you can only
use I were in certain states

501
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:31,200
you know I am I and

502
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,510
in and we've been trying to think up
ways to get around that there was one

503
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,500
way I mean

504
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,669
arm that would be obvious is it to do it
all in real time

505
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:46,000
but actually that's that's a little bit
more tricky from a code stamp point

506
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,799
and a fifties in real time or a lot more
trouble to deal with

507
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,299
arm another thing that I thought I have
them email you guys would have a good

508
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,210
idea on this

509
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,840
is that incentive writing it out to the
drive to the store as a memory location

510
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,190
and then you know and have the FFT
analyzer that way

511
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,399
probably still be considered recording
though you know i mean

512
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:09,110
are so basically the only way they have
around is probably

513
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,390
by doing in real time which is kinda a
pain in the ass

514
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:19,390
arm you know and then there's also arms
I go ahead

515
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:32,020
way help

516
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,989
right

517
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:42,989
right

518
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:45,470
desi that's that's the that's the
problem

519
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,690
say that way so basically what you're
saying is a even storing and RAM is

520
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,570
still considered a copy of their

521
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:55,260
only therefore you're killing said what
are you doing

522
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,129
if arm so probably therefore probably
still considered

523
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,789
illegally probably still be considered
you know by then there's some places

524
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:06,990
like you know you go bad in a toll on
every five seconds or whatever

525
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,600
and and or just don't tell anybody
you're doing a shit in the first place

526
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,700
arm in shoot

527
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,700
okay

528
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,600
Matt the ago I actually thats and I
think it's it's gonna be your local

529
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,240
jurisdiction even if you're

530
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,220
taking I were in its running a server in
Nevada by me executing it from say

531
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,030
Florida

532
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,420
I think it's going to be the Florida
laws which is a two-party state even

533
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,100
though Nevada action at what is now
two-party state is an

534
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,660
no gonna grab a dated I we found that
out a deaf car remember

535
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,800
half another story occurred at Def Con

536
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,800
water how could I forget deaf guy now
there

537
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,890
yes

538
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:26,890
right right right

539
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,700
well with the for your

540
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:38,230
yeah exactly that's the reason I was
saying he was saying basically that

541
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,870
a BBC your point was that the best date
is actually coming from the telco side

542
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,990
and how they actually have my point I
mean the CNAME services are really nice

543
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,970
now you can do it really fast where if
you do in the back smoothing

544
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,190
the old fashion way it kinda slow by I
that's where your best date is

545
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,910
you now if I number has been changed in
a couple weeks

546
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,420
the CNAME database that you're hitting
is it gonna know about it you know

547
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,460
but the telcos Rd updated and whatnot in
thing out

548
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,950
right

549
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,820
right right

550
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,820
exactly yeah I i've not see it happened
quite that fast but you have been pretty

551
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,880
fast where the caller ID information
gets updated pretty quickly

552
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,020
arm yeah so for the name skipper some

553
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:35,929
I'm so those are so yeah so the the
legality things and if anybody I mean

554
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:39,370
the RAM idea was just one idea for
everybody else has any other ideas

555
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:46,370
right track said those five think about
10 seconds might be

556
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,130
the way it is in some places it doesn't
really matter I'm

557
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,330
are yes so that's that's also another
part about to say if you throw in the

558
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,490
beat on without

559
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,760
cover you legally I don't know Mike

560
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:07,760
right Brett right go ahead

561
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,610
yeah actually Karrimor the patch using
what others have to say

562
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,960
right when they pick up this call may be
recorded for quality assurance

563
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,549
I read it sad and it would be just for
quality assurance

564
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:31,549
on the Do Not Call list thing

565
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,210
well actually it's a violation all the
way around is doing this shit

566
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,890
Saeed its I I am

567
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,260
arm I'm not trying to like push Blake

568
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,320
my product on anybody ever you like over
the phone

569
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,520
I i'm just calling in saying what he
answered you know

570
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I'm India

571
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:09,860
you talk about seeing stuff

572
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:20,829
now I could I could barely here love it
but something about finding sopra

573
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:24,229
season Suffolk that arm asking about say
the skipper

574
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:28,619
what I wore does anyway arm there are
actually a lot of tools are

575
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:33,529
for you know I'm I got what's the the
one that I always see

576
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:37,639
heading our network on fifty sixty its
something quite scanner

577
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,669
I think this question is if the if there
is any commercial products that you see

578
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,819
other for Penn testers 2000

579
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:45,899
okay I'm sorry I'm my hearings terrible
not mom

580
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:49,179
there actually are some they're
incredibly expensive

581
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,649
and which I find just kinda ridiculous
because of a bomb

582
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:56,049
there are some arm that but the
easygoing like the

583
00:34:56,049 --> 00:35:00,279
thousands a dollar range and they they
but they can handle like multiple modems

584
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:03,640
but nine times out end up investors I
talk to her like I I gotta scan this

585
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,118
area

586
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,469
Billy loading up your I wore their
wedding Tone Loc

587
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:11,349
DOS box you know and is ready that way
cuz I like fire in this

588
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:14,420
Tom ok still rock see you know even to
this day arm

589
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,019
so the arm these are some the place you
can find out more information before

590
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,219
Stella for .org

591
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,420
we run a can have a big voice bridge
boys conference people get on from all

592
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,229
over the world in chit chat about
technology and stuff like that

593
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:32,019
then we also run like old-school BBS is
an and stuff like that and I'm not sure

594
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:35,069
how much time I have left but I could
show with a video about like stuff that

595
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:35,380
we've

596
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,640
find on these adventures if our
anybody's interested

597
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,799
up okay

598
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:47,549
now is plenty of time a course can be
difficult

599
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:50,829
they have to do again weird

600
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:57,829
for whatever reason

601
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,830
any duration had a mean now I did

602
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,660
that's just recording in general doesn't
matter how long the actual recording

603
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,640
takes place for

604
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,600
arm on

605
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,890
you having

606
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,240
why do want to serve as this 3 I am

607
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,440
requirements thus have to be fulfilled
in a two-party state city that the poor

608
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,930
the

609
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,879
verbal warning or record in stating that
then now we can get away with their

610
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,890
but it there's no time limit or any

611
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,529
you know watermark there to get away
with it I am its any type a recording

612
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,640
I mean if the other gentleman the same
just one packet so I mean if that's you

613
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,009
know there could be no second so

614
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,840
love recording they say that thats thats
you know enough on the regulation

615
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,170
make your yeah area

616
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,990
no I don't think that there is no
specification for that it's there you

617
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,350
just have to meet those requirements
otherwise a broken off

618
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:05,100
as their

619
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,069
occur thank God

620
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,400
its computer beef I know worst
presentation

621
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,670
okay yes as usual I'm so serious look at
the

622
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,880
let's look at something and say Russia

623
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,020
arm and

624
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:32,020
here might wanna with pool

625
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,590
so this is arm 'em

626
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,310
we're bored and we decided to call arm
around the kremlin

627
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:43,070
a lot arm if and this is like here you
find all kinds of fun

628
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,460
interesting things I'm actually gonna
let you guys guess

629
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,460
what this is if it ever comes up good

630
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:03,630
what do you what do you think this
device might be any any ideas

631
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,360
Cisco router yes now

632
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,460
yeah exactly now

633
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,890
and if you're wondering about the
location on this

634
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,359
arm let's see here

635
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:26,360
thing the interface is being news

636
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,560
Ando there it is user

637
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,450
and so you find a lot of stuff like this
where your dial and it'll be a router

638
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,770
and as saying hello

639
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:41,820
tell me what to do if you are you
kidding me really you you just use what

640
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,570
your network to desist silly so

641
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,100
that's like one just the brief example
arm

642
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:54,060
with the yeah

643
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,870
and I also do

644
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,640
I I don't do it as much anymore East do
a lot of stuff with I X 25 network

645
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,350
storage bin cover fascination

646
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:08,020
mind and these are like really weird
strange networks for anybody

647
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,240
the last like I think we talked a lot
about X 25 so ago

648
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,700
to detailed into it but com

649
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,030
like to say here assay

650
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:24,410
be found this evening at home we want it
is again

651
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:31,410
it should be pretty obvious

652
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,579
we going

653
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:41,019
area so what is it that obviously

654
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:45,239
probably at HP UX box now where is it
where the will work

655
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:48,729
see this is how the being so from a
terminal server so what every connected

656
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:49,509
on the poor

657
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:52,650
it just makes basically a Telnet
connection I have actually seen

658
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,650
situations

659
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,049
where York because you see at the very
top trying I'm poor you know

660
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:00,069
and support their and I have seen
situations where they

661
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:04,170
forgot to disable the Escape key so
whatever you call and it makes a

662
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,660
connection that he can escape back to
the terminal server

663
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,430
which usually has default passwords left
in place and of course this is only

664
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,989
during

665
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:15,160
penetration testing by I'm so did you
see that he saw the IP address that was

666
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,339
associated with that

667
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:20,359
ray arm

668
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,670
so

669
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:30,670
it could be

670
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:37,080
it might be a par the seven 54th

671
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,029
Electronic Systems Group US military so

672
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,970
arm you know if judging by the
information I'm getting back from the

673
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,600
dialup

674
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,600
is is correct so arm and we'll see what
else we have here

675
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,840
pack

676
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:08,040
where do you see any appear that you're
interested in

677
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,720
a british telecommunications are BT
their big provided the

678
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,720
this is actually there X 25 network com
that you can connect up to

679
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,110
arm and it's used a lot and Om

680
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,450
well actually free now uses much more
but was used a lot for like banking

681
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,200
applications and stuff like that at
that's another thing is fine arm

682
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,370
there's no way I'm gonna miss you arm

683
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:33,109
there's this great russia has the best X
25 networks

684
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,170
arm with just

685
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:40,670
stuff all over it you

686
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:47,670
no sister Russia

687
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,980
see but I don't see that video in here
so if there's what's up

688
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,080
yeah it's actually called our OL on the
file name

689
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,350
bottom oh yeah I see them there

690
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,900
and wanted to this will be a harder one

691
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,920
for you guys think tell me what I
believe if

692
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,070
if it's earlier I guess both of them are
empty more than likely

693
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:17,170
yeah I'm sorry about that well anyways
we had arm

694
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,110
I guess dinghy copied over but on the
russian networking go on and

695
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,770
we've I like Motorola Vanguard's you
remember those their like are these all

696
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,460
routers and her menu systems

697
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,850
and basically I there you go on and it's
a password and then

698
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,350
it a lot on earlier be on the sting in
the header and then it's okay thank you

699
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:38,140
are males correct arm how would you like
me to

700
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,450
what would you like me to do good thing
by Tom

701
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,120
the hotel about word I like buckingham
palace and

702
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,060
a random yeah actually I'm I my fringe a
falcon who's gonna be

703
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,540
assisting from he has this thing he
called me it was the fourth of July

704
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,029
and you know this casually as they could
be doing today

705
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:02,460
think that is hanging out family war
dialing buckingham palace

706
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,340
does likewise like dude is a fucking for
the July it was like what you do on the

707
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,800
fourth

708
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,870
helicopter really thats we gotta let the
Queen lol forgot about writing and

709
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,080
actually last time we did show building
management system that we did find

710
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,509
I what will he found a law or dying
there I

711
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:22,250
area EE somebody set us for could we
turn up the %uh

712
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,250
temperature on the throne so but

713
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,110
feels a kind of get up building
management systems are gonna be unique

714
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,210
things to see as well

715
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,260
I I think it's pretty much about Iran
and

716
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,240
yeah he's the he dials and he's a equal
opportunity

717
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,570
I harasser I guess you could say so
he'll die like 10,000 embers in Iran but

718
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,520
then he always goes after israel's well
kinda feels bad that is picking on Iran

719
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,930
to the lower dow Israel 10,000 times and
I think it's like

720
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,770
somehow these balloting is karma dollars
I'd rather

721
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:56,020
of Bob that you guys have any other
questions or anything

722
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,530
because I think I'm I'm about out
material

723
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,820
the Outer Barrier nap what's up

724
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:09,400
over their recordings

725
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,020
wow that's a good question so you mean
like if you're dialing Russia

726
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,280
and your recordings actually I don't
know I don't know I've never really

727
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,160
looked into that

728
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,430
arm I guess it probably wouldn't matter
um

729
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,830
so therefore make sure you dial board
I'll tell the country

730
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:32,830
yes is the more of the store yeah

731
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,900
and outside the hit rate I'm finding him

732
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,300
%uh interesting stuff is always the same
it's it's

733
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,520
so alaska like I don't think I've
actually done a lot with alaska

734
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,750
BJ Falcon has used to live there is
actually busted in operation Sandoval

735
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,450
back today

736
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,000
bomb he %ah he might have gone through
their

737
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,230
probably have a better answer but it's a
pretty low success rate you're looking

738
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,740
for

739
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,530
really you now really not a lot of
people

740
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,180
the connect up stuff that way and to
miss the big if I'm they don't even know

741
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,540
it still connected up that way

742
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,900
bike yet they're likely shed with the
spots line is connected to this modem

743
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,000
and we didn't even know it was here
kinda think so

744
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
BC a lot a good

745
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,270
oh yeah

746
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:29,280
yeah yeah

747
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,850
yeah that's that's pretty much the way
we roll as well we use our

748
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,759
a lot about not so much Canada but
European providers but basically you're

749
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,010
saying the HD Moore

750
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:41,360
are goes to provide it to Canada he
dials out love

751
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,070
was Austin Texas or whatever and then
goes in and hits

752
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:49,020
right and the tap points so convoluted
nobody's going to come after me.

753
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,750
the russian mom I come after me if I
they find out I'm looking at the routers

754
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,900
or somebody might be but I'm not worried
about

755
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,870
are are I don't really worry about that
especially overseas and i Justi overseas

756
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,609
though cuz I usually find a more
interesting

757
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,300
I mean if i nom man as I said like
places like Iran I mean

758
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,520
you don't know what the hell you're
gonna find you know we found liking

759
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,530
are thus israel's identified itself as
an encrypted fax machine

760
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,440
but as a modem carrier panels that
causes great whilst play with this

761
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,440
for a little while yeah are good only
two

762
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:33,100
you only been kicked off to american
VoIP providers yeah it is largely

763
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,180
depends cuz

764
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:38,060
la these some carries this won't even
notice by like one big

765
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,420
I think when J Falcons backs moving all
Malibu

766
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,570
I think he said he went to like three or
four providers because they were you

767
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,150
like dipping and they're like

768
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,700
you not here to argue with them is like
my man

769
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,970
I got us to get twenty dollars with you
guys know I will give you back your

770
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,820
twenty dollars

771
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,200
is never touch our shit ever again radio
call me up

772
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:06,200
well you're kicked off again that you
are actually

773
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,530
you at that point it is worried about
like you know the boy you trying to go

774
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,440
under the flyer

775
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,780
the VoIP providers so you don't lose
your 20 bucks for doing this silly stuff

776
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:21,780
so you good

777
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,450
of course yeah well I mean I think the

778
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:34,910
the new part is people like you know HD
and whatnot cuz you said what is new to

779
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:35,399
this

780
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,890
boost for if someone is needed this

781
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:46,890
what should have VoIP doing the get the
most common one that I i've seen guys

782
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,970
who'll take like

783
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,960
mixer she I wore and then plug it into
their phone line and say let's war now

784
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,540
the White House and then

785
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,020
and then they're like why II you now um
pieces

786
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,840
is he like other reading like nineteen
eighty five text files in this is like

787
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,070
for those the way to do it

788
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,280
and now with fam VoIP and whatnot you
can carry

789
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,060
create a little bit more anonymity and
like these guys don't work how to arm

790
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,850
don't realize how to go about doing that
you know I mean like setting up an after

791
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,029
boxer dealing with the boy provider is
it is never done it before

792
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:22,420
so I mean that that's like the biggest
one I had it have a pretty mine actually

793
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,900
I naming this new I really serve I wore
that should be out probably couple weeks

794
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,580
are it's called serve passive arts cat
dials 911

795
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,819
and the reasons call there's my friend
survived who are known for years

796
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,950
who is using this software and arm we
were still doing

797
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,150
I love CVS updates and so he was like
working with new code might not

798
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:45,750
and there's evidently a bug so he's
fired up

799
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,440
I wore it was going on and it was going
on and he was leaving his house in as he

800
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,440
left his house

801
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,400
police cars when flying by him and

802
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,570
he was kinda like wow that's weird maybe
I'll turn to go home and see what's

803
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,990
going on maybe use you know my wiper
some things having

804
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,150
though he goes back calling the police
are in his yard they're like

805
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,440
music what the hell you doing is sick
well we've you were calling 911

806
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,490
the thousand times we got worried about
you AP lit already didn't get any

807
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,420
trouble for the thank God I thought so
fricking bad

808
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,230
arm but he told the police arm the cat
sometimes plays with the fall

809
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,420
fell it was probably the cat

810
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,160
cell then I was like well I did he told
me a story I felt so bad I was like what

811
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,109
survives cat dials 911 so

812
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,430
as that's what is going to be named Tom
this code release

813
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:40,430
with alright

814
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,990
actually in most cases the the question
was amazing as

815
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,090
II war or are more box going

816
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,900
directly through the provider are you
doing of a fantastic server wanna

817
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,650
i've typically like to do it often ask
server as you know a lot a lot of these

818
00:49:59,650 --> 00:49:59,920
like

819
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,560
both have our bob use a software-only
Sapporo II x2

820
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,860
that protocol are so if you use it
carrier

821
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,670
it the software doesn't natively support
it yet arm

822
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:14,350
but that's going to be coming around I
am but I like to go through

823
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,560
half and it works better to both of our
software for some reason so who would

824
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,000
you try to use it directly

825
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,840
with the provider and fire up fifty
channels it's like the channels get all

826
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,680
stuck in

827
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,279
but if I have a task server sitting in
between strict flawless at work script

828
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,000
so

829
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,340
thats alright cool

830
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,680
I think use flashing the thing anyways

831
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,460
now okay well I'm out over

832
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,580
stuff so up you're welcome

833
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:49,310
yes good

834
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,009
now actually it's not it's not related
to the form but paid at all it's

835
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:53,950
actually tied

836
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,880
to the phone number so for instance you
know you probably couldn't go and look

837
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
at Marc Hamel

838
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,330
you know in the malibu form directory it
actually data that's being supplied from

839
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,710
the

840
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:07,750
telecom from the I telecom provider

841
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,950
so to speak so does it really matter if
they have their phone number is listed

842
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,119
as you know private or whatever

843
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,260
if you can still look at that
information you can still you know

844
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:23,260
get the number so to speak but but

845
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,400
right he was in that in that particular
less what he was doing is a cross

846
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,760
referencing amongst multiple databases

847
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,130
so he was due in one was boxy name and
one was actually the telco data

848
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,650
and he was drifting across like actually
was more to there's

849
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,450
like four different providers so he was
hit again saying that says

850
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:47,020
mark am all for instance we'll see what
Boxxy name says he can to get

851
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:54,020
a correlation say is this really the
number that I think it is conflict

852
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,120
right

853
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,839
I really right right

854
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,030
actually that's the one thing usually at
me and told I guess recently

855
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:13,420
he typically didn't that cell phones are
the worst case you didn't get that kind

856
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,070
of data

857
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,840
you wouldn't get the CNAME kinda stuff
you know just be bob's for my wildest

858
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,580
the phone number that's it arm these
guys you know I love these phone numbers

859
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,710
over shy and these are like their office
line kinda stuff they usually have like

860
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,920
somebody scream

861
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,090
you now to make sure assholes like me
are calling

862
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:38,090

863
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:48,779
right in

864
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:56,079
