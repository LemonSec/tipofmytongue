1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:05,830
go

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,490
hey everybody welcome to the end

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,190
II

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,359
you know I've really been struggling
with is that a good thing to be

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,810
the last speaker or not come a
backhanded compliment maybe people stick

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,609
around the conference to hear you talk

7
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:28,640
or maybe it's that they know no ones
gonna shop to talk so you'll feel bad

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,029
because everyone wholehearted left

9
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,130
here

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,210
two years ago I

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,800
came to blast hope and

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,950
I talked

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,980
about a buncha stuff that nears I been
able to track

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,570
some seven thousand downloads and

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,879
I kid you not three universities and two
colleges

16
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,699
using this course material I said some
stuff

17
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,180
if you don't know about me

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,470
hi crimes James sometimes people know me
as material

19
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,798
I do all kinds a interesting security
crap

20
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,760
do it for a long time most important
thing you need to know about me is that

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,060
I am NOT an expert

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,060
at anything I'm here to talk to you
about your career in

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,610
how your career might not be going the
way that you audit showed

24
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,509
I mean we all wanna have awesome Kors
how many people actually work

25
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,920
in InfoSec for real yeah I

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,070
is Nick great is nip

27
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,140
of some two years ago

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,939
everything was awesome money was flowing

29
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,680
we were buying more blinking lights
shiny things than any of us knew what to

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,320
do with

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,040
because blinking lights and shiny things
what makes the world secure

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,380
we all know that's right arm their water
budgets

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,798
lots of room to spend money we had teams
II

34
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,259
everybody was getting promotions at a
rate that looks more dot com ish then

35
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,970
anything else and you could find
yourself going from

36
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,910
in turn to security analysts to CISO in
about

37
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,220
eight seconds and three steps that was
there was traffic was not post richard

38
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,660
for everybody because it was gonna go on
forever

39
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,579
and we all know that humanity increases

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,819
exponentially and it's just going to
continue forever because that's the way

41
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,849
the world works right

42
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:35,849
and fan

43
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,280
you should know this happened very very
shortly after I talked to the world was

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,889
rosy

45
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:44,180
it was kinda crushing I felt bad

46
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,549
well I feel really bad because people
were still downloading the talk

47
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:53,180
still enjoying I kept getting emails
about it I'll email

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,980
literally week ago about talk was two
years old it's it's completely awesome

49
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,980
so

50
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,060
when bad things happen it means is
opportunity right

51
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,169
any kind of change is an opportunity for
goodness

52
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,500
its a few nodding heads nobody is awake
at this point anymore

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,609
I perhaps a from A+ from this room con
funk

54
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:21,010
Mike Oct

55
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,070
wash please I'm

56
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,350
the economic downturn would bring new
ways to solve

57
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,010
problems right hack

58
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,799
comes down to one word: stimulus

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,790
kinda really weird word girl politicians
Kors

60
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,769
sounds a little too politician doesn't
stimulus

61
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,200
I'm there are all kinds of ways to solve
problems when

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,980
a lot of the rules go away right you you
can say things that are demonstrably

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,930
untrue

64
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,000
and it's okay because it's a different
world

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,030
you know in in this postcard apocalypse
world

66
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,360
we can do things differently we can

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,390
find new ways to take value in our
existing assets

68
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,650
and convert that value through to
shareholder benefit

69
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,060
because information security is a profit
center for most organizations

70
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,280
I'm at the very least

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,120
we can re factor what we have right
because

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,760
we've made a lot of investments over the
years in with you later shiny things

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,070
and because those blinky lights are not
in Kansas lights the LED's

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,120
they will blink forever so we'll just
keep

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,010
redeploying the same stuff in you know
maybe we'll find a new way to do that

76
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,070
if nothing else

77
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,280
we can at least get an immediate benefit
for something that would suggest it

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,630
might take two or three years to get a
benefit from

79
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,310
largely because we can increase the air
conditioning capacity

80
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,240
our data centers by turning off the
security tools that we don't understand

81
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,300
how to use

82
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,870
immediate benefit kno wat required

83
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,910
and even if we're doing a completely
wrong that's completely okay

84
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,340
so

85
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,220
the the negative parts the universe EEM
to be conspiring

86
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,730
Rite Aid everything is working against
getting any good stuff done

87
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,160
and because we can't get any good stuff
done we're ending up

88
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,440
as sort of the the sand in the gears
were getting ground up and

89
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,320
everything is getting unpleasant I'm
however

90
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,349
the world is not on possible there there
are ways around this

91
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,640
I'm it it starts with the fact that

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,010
you have to accept your blocked and are
obstacles

93
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,419
and those obstacles are gonna go away
and

94
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,099
if you can accept that and do something
with it

95
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,280
and about it you don't end up completely
trapped

96
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,600
I mean if you want to give up please go
ahead give up

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,180
the rest of us could use your jobs I'm
pair

98
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,530
but if you give up you have to give
yourself a fail stamp right in the

99
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,520
middle of your forehead

100
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,469
because you gave up and giving up

101
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,919
is well tantamount to giving up your
humanity really if you stop struggling

102
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,140
because that's all it is its you know
forty years if you're lucky you're

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,930
eighty years if you're lucky a struggle

104
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,300
but I think there's only five real kinds
a struggle to go to work for

105
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,850
so open question do you guys want lots a
room for questions at the end

106
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,270
you wanna interrupt me all the way
through or do you just want

107
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,630
another 50 minutes contact ABC

108
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,320
user clickers if

109
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,770
it's like herding cats I swear

110
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,310
and with sound effects

111
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,200
art scenario 0

112
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,200
alright comedy from the back you need a
job call it the economic downturn it's

113
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,820
got nothing to do with confidence

114
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,000
no job sucks Notre actually sucks a lot

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,630
because I bet you better than 80 percent
in the boys room

116
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,810
evaluate your own personal self worth
based on

117
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,900
your contribution to others be it
through

118
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,130
job war social connections or that one

119
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,430
free software product you work on that
for some indescribable reason

120
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,540
puts id3 tags into databases so

121
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,750
elemental feature all open source
products um

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,630
begin there's lots of advice that goes
with

123
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,550
you got no job most if it's available
from the government

124
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,849
because they're experts in employment

125
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,320
and give you all that same advice I
polish your resume a

126
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,620
om wash I'll

127
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,340
it's like it's like waves coming off

128
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,650
terrifying I'm all that advice counts

129
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,380
right it it's all tried to read and
tested the parts were pretty resume on

130
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,580
fancy paper

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,440
I'm including the love note to the
21-year-old human resources

132
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,659
representative who can't read your
resume

133
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,710
all that stuff is very important arm

134
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,700
and the most important part or all of it
really is you need to accept that

135
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,719
out over the millions of people work
early without work

136
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:27,940
and that alone should be a kinda scary
thing because the numbers that they're

137
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,270
reporting other people who are

138
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,349
looking for work not the people who've
given up and our drinking water schlitz

139
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,960
winning the mom's basement the most
important thing for you guys is

140
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,789
you are hackers it years our system

141
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,069
it is a process what do you do

142
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,900
you disassemble large systems and
processes figure out how they work

143
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,220
and figure out how to right around the
fact that they're stupid

144
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,230
so do it figure out how the human
resources

145
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,350
function works in different
organizations most were built on a

146
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,960
couple a consultant

147
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,590
consultant models to care for I say that
works

148
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,190
insane wrong a lot lately in I

149
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,650
there are a very small number human
resource consultants organizations

150
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,410
and they are very very good at moving
there are three ring binders

151
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,290
into other organizations so most human
resources functions work the same way

152
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,240
it's just a matter of learning not and
on slates not that hard POS lo

153
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,860
it's a rich engineering problem loves
the smallest order

154
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,320
and then figure out what you're doing
wrong in relation to it

155
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,460
and the list of things that you're doing
wrong

156
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,680
are probably so simple that as soon as
you possibly

157
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,710
about you have one of those home right

158
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,500
kinda moments and your fix what the
problem is you get through system

159
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,450
so water summer those kinds of problems

160
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,270
you're under qualified

161
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:59,540
you're overqualified you have the wrong
qualifications

162
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,819
any the sound familiar kinda sad asthma

163
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,070
I'm if you have one resume you're doing
it wrong

164
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,920
if you have and jobs to apply to

165
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,939
and you have and -1 resumes you're still
doing it wrong

166
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,120
sorry but that's the way it is

167
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,600
the way that the systems are now
engineered

168
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,050
it's a lot like finite element analysis
in manufacturing everybody knows how

169
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,970
that was developed to ensure that your
thing

170
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,800
breaks one day after 12 runs out human
resources departments

171
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,860
structure on exactly the same model
they're no longer shopping for employees

172
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,110
the shopping for a skill set and their
skill set

173
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,370
can be has particular and in same

174
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,340
as you can imagine for example if you
want to be a security analyst working in

175
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,880
a mid-size retail organization

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,990
helping out with PCI compliance and you
don't have 10-plus years a PCI

177
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,710
compliance experience

178
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,290
because that's what HR thinks you need

179
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,730
peace here's

180
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,900
right yeah so almost bought points to
talk about your

181
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,900
awesome experience just don't give a
specific number

182
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,860
years and start of the list abort points
with 10 plus years experience in

183
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,110
you know it its its rolling around these
ridiculous

184
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,100
unsolvable incomprehensible problems too
could turn yourself

185
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
with whatever center capabilities and
characteristics you have

186
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,730
into a match for what they're looking
for even though

187
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,400
it angers you to do so

188
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,890
right very how many people have have
applied for a job that angered up their

189
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,620
blood to apply for

190
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,060
painful was it because you realize that
you're you're

191
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,820
your you giving up some beer elemental
self-interest fit into their mold

192
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,860
masters wrong isn't just terrible

193
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,890
for long short easy nice side

194
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,710
happy version of it is it's a system
figure it out

195
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,820
everyone if you can do that it's not
hard the best way to figure it out

196
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,090
is to ask

197
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,700
send an email to HR at and say hey I'm
thinking of applying to a job what's the

198
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,470
best way to get through this through

199
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,550
use that network of colleagues that you
know and cherish

200
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,890
Facebook Linkedin whatever these kids
are doing today

201
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,280
get to the point where you're into the
system

202
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,400
even if into the system means you have
to

203
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,460
suck it up you can hear that a lot

204
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,900
so you got a job but you're going
nowhere

205
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,280
is a little familiar I'm meteoric rise
would be nice

206
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,829
and and a lot of us enjoyed meteoric
rise you know in in 15 years I went from

207
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,190
guy who can figures just talk it to guy
who

208
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,560
runs information security for midsize
publicly traded financial institution

209
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,980
we it was awesome along the way I

210
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,660
had a lot of great numbers from an AI
may be paroled after a big round numbers

211
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,260
oh my god you're so young cute

212
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,730
or I'm just grumpy Compu old man

213
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,870
the meteoric rise stuff is awesome when
it does happen but you have to accept

214
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,780
the fact that it's not going to happen
all the time

215
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,920
that you're gonna have to spend time in
Grade

216
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,250
there's a lot that can be learned from

217
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,360
yet again sucking it up paying your dues
for a little bit longer

218
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,420
I mean it would be nice to pay your dues
for

219
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,510
you know a year and then get that
promotion

220
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,819
so you're going you staff team lead

221
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,060
manager director mistress under God

222
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,350
in your one-year increments that would
be terrific

223
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,420
maybe it means you gotta spend two or
three years as Team Lead

224
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,420
maybe it means you're just not going to
get there

225
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,060
and you can just enjoy the fact you have
a job because there's what's your

226
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,660
colleagues don't

227
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,130
there's lots of people who don't there's
people for whom cat food is looking like

228
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,280
a legitimate food source

229
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,630
this is the whole suck it up again

230
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,420
because your stock and because you know
how to do your job because you can do

231
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,640
the job for a year two years reverend
and you're good at it

232
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,220
good enough that we should performance
reviews are covered in red ink

233
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,770
you can start spending time make
yourself more rounded

234
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,860
this does not mean expanding to fill the
gap between the armrests

235
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,050
your chair something else entirely

236
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,780
II go to school take courses

237
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,280
learn gotta cons prove that you can
learn

238
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,990
I'm little things that are not related
to things that you already like

239
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,290
because I mean we all know that your IT
experts your computer experts in

240
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,360
you super duper security dudes and
dudettes max great

241
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,860
do you know the difference between a
democrat hands up

242
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,820
people know the difference jim DeMint a
credit okay

243
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,650
which one is an asset

244
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,160
see can talk to reading your bank
statement or if you know the difference

245
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,600
between bank statement accounting

246
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm do you know how to restore financial
statements I mean really read them pick

247
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,760
a balance sheet

248
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,480
pick up an income statement pick up cash
flow statement and figure out what it

249
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,200
means

250
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,180
if you don't know you need to I'm

251
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,730
question or admitting that you do know
on what you're the only one dude

252
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,230
used to be in management

253
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:42,230
don't tell people normal

254
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,890
focus these kids today

255
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,569
so learn about something that is
unrelated

256
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,490
you know I one my favorite questions
when I go in as a consultant to an

257
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,520
organization is asking something the IT
department what is the company does to

258
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,270
generate money

259
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,230
what is what is the crank attached to
the widget maker that makes your company

260
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,810
money just how many it. folk

261
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,210
can answer that question statistically 0

262
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,720
over 15 years over 150 companies

263
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,970
statistically 0 IT people have any idea
what it is the company does to make

264
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,380
money

265
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,510
so because you're stuck in grade

266
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,250
and you're putting in time what do you
what is your company does

267
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,420
gone how does insurance work or

268
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,780
not work case maybe depending on who you
work for I'm

269
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,160
how does your manufacturing is Asian
work

270
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,250
are you a middleman kinda organization

271
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,410
and all you do is exist to him thanks
reluctant your right hand

272
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,100
what does that all mean asked to shadow
somebody operations

273
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,230
you know were it's funny we are watching
on television when the CEO 7-Eleven is

274
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,839
learning how the Slurpee machine works

275
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,320
but maybe it's important for everybody
to understand how it is that your

276
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,380
organization makes money

277
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,600
because you might find there's net
contributions that can be made

278
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,170
if only you understood because in your

279
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,430
security person ivory tower of course
you know everything

280
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,459
and you're perfectly well equipped to
tell

281
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,209
operational people this is the way it is
even though each

282
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,350
you've got no idea what the way is that
it is be obligated shiny things on your

283
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,938
side and

284
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,620
you cancer see that there's this
opportunity for

285
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,990
comprehension and being able to be the

286
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,830
only person at the table who can make
the good smart suggestion

287
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,129
has a tendency to get you noticed and

288
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:42,130
I mean you can always take basket
weaving courses to actually really

289
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,110
careful as I get through this chunk

290
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:53,110
anybody have maladjusted coworkers
anybody who isn't picking up their hand

291
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,120
is either unemployed or lying or they
are the maladjusted culture

292
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,570
somebody's

293
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,610
really got burning years from now on how
many people work with this guy

294
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,950
there

295
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,280
like this actual human being or just
somebody who acts like this guy you

296
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,470
actually work with this guy

297
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,640
ok yep

298
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,630
is been a jerk is me yeah

299
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,460
there's not much you can do

300
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,970
this is another case of suck it up which
is the recurring theme

301
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,450
the stock I'm watch office space a lot

302
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,020
there's not much else you can do really
remember that you have a life

303
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,660
outside of work right so if your
coworkers are

304
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,240
causing you troubles if they're
interesting

305
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,630
in all those ways that are not
interesting you just need to right

306
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,310
around that

307
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,760
you know this is yet another form of
life censorship

308
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,690
and you just need to suck it up find
something to do that makes them

309
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,000
less humiliating to you or find ways to
humiliate them

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,330
um me your

311
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,000
act profit of stories here

312
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960
me one story okay all

313
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,590
yeah everything's off the record

314
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,360
II will I will file serial numbers of
this one really well

315
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,970
your problem so we would have allowed
talker coworker

316
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,140
your

317
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,380
anybody no way too much for the
coworkers life

318
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,020
anybody sitting on deadlines that are

319
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,379
insurmountable and yet they're coworker
has

320
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,660
details and I mean our long
conversations about golf scores

321
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,930
and kids hockey games in the middle of
the day may be worse the co worker would

322
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,370
do

323
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,420
some damn work yeah so

324
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,540
these people exist a lot and you can do
funny and entertaining things with them

325
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,270
in this case a little bit a scotch tape

326
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,550
on the inside phone handset next
microphone at work so well

327
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,909
watched luck talk to get louder and
louder and louder

328
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,060
and allow talkers pasta something about
the problem I am

329
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,260
in also passive aggressive notes

330
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,200
they work great just we will note to get
right to the monger

331
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
says shot for up just

332
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,270
don't use your own handwriting for your
own paper or your own marker

333
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:45,270
and remember the tape takes fingerprints
also if you work in you nice environment

334
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,670
don't do that you will get a grievance
filed against you

335
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,180
I'm these people

336
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,770
really do make it hard to you maintain a
job there these people end up being the

337
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,340
reason why lots of people leave

338
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,560
this isn't really noticed while in large
part because

339
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,030
there's this thing that HR people have
column exit interview

340
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,770
they may have an exit interview take the

341
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,050
the card real unemployed in this room
start shock me a lot other people only

342
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,020
ever had one job

343
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,129
I'm exit interviews are

344
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,150
nine different kinds find the companies
trying to figure out why it is that you

345
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,980
want to leave

346
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,920
they're also forced exit interviews
which are completely different

347
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,060
I her if there's a security guard your
exit interview

348
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,399
don't use these tips %ah it's a chance
for you to explain

349
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,910
why it is that you don't wanna be there
anymore and

350
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,870
it's worthwhile to tell at least a
little bit at the truth

351
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,210
you can't all the truth unless you
really are okay with burning every

352
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,140
single bridge

353
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,220
I'm but the way the Human Resources
legislation works out in most

354
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,140
jurisdictions

355
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,740
it doesn't really matter because most HR
departments will admit

356
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,970
only that you worked there the dates
that you worked there

357
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,970
and that is all they won't say yes this
person is rehire uble

358
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,250
they won't say stay away from the Freak

359
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,900
because they can't so in your exit
interview

360
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,380
take the time and say okay folks here's
the deal Bob

361
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,640
and Edna make it so that I don't want to
work here anymore

362
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,890
and if they hear that two or three times

363
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,880
bill realize that bob lamar problem
human resources

364
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,210
operates slowly but efficiently
eventually

365
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,410
it's not gonna help you but it might
help some other people that you've left

366
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,060
behind

367
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,370
ridiculous plowing your record

368
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,580
running from your coworkers no

369
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,620
good you'll her in a bit maybe your jobs
just a job

370
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:53,110
summer doesn't occur to most people
because we're passionate about the stuff

371
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,570
right I mean how many people fix the
relatives computers to keep getting

372
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,139
infected

373
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,700
Anna people convince the world has
changed operating system so we still

374
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,270
have to do

375
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,879
all tech support all Thanksgiving
weekend an hour

376
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,010
doesn't work out either does a because
they go right back to Best Buy

377
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,790
so

378
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,750
maybe it's just a job and foremost %uh
City

379
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,920
even contemplating how to do that is
very very difficult

380
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,200
how do you stop carrying

381
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,070
quite that much scotch

382
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,550
cheers

383
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:41,550
you have to say at the end of the day I
did my schtick

384
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,150
and on

385
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,200
and it's hard to learn the

386
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,050
it starts as one of those you know I
learned it from remembered it I

387
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,570
a little string around your finger to
remember menu ties turned other finger

388
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,370
to remember white aster on this finger

389
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,780
keister on somebody's throat remind you
why he wanted to leave

390
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,200
I so

391
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,600
simply try you know proposed know your
monitor

392
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,710
right word Password the right below that
leave my job is just a job

393
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,790
can come anytime somebody tries to use
that log in your system

394
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,149
our job is also a game forgot to mention
that

395
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,090
but leaves work height when you walk
away from from the office walk away from

396
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,620
the office

397
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,040
when you walk away from home realize
that you're setting aside

398
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,540
that which is you in favor of that which
gives you money to be

399
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,210
you its of her that sounds

400
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,510
in all possibility you're just missing
out on crazy

401
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,760
so your career is awesome the coworkers

402
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,340
are survivable and/or in the room so you
won't admit the terrible

403
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,820
but you really can't express you crazy
you

404
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,220
puncher rebels tattooed

405
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,970
crazy hairstyles t-shirts with
unexplainable crock

406
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,600
on math jokes yeah

407
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,320
yeah you really think your coworkers
like you for that crap

408
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,570
care yeah

409
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,510
and and you're facing the reality that
you just you gotta get your

410
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,710
your well hopefully you're not getting
your freak out at work

411
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,830
which are you crazy at work anyways and

412
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,470
that's hard to do and what organizations
you know

413
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,520
a lot organizations still operate on

414
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,000
nineteen fifties nineteen forties
management paradigm says

415
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
you know it doesn't matter how
productive you are so long as somebody

416
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,420
can see that you're sitting in a cubicle

417
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,420
thats management by padding heads

418
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,640
and you know I worked organizations like
that to where

419
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,760
the entirety love the organization is
structured

420
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,730
on attendance rather than productivity
and that's hard if you're a generally

421
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,480
productive person because it means
spending a lot of time getting

422
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,020
a five on Slashdot hoping somebody will
post something that isn't crap I'm

423
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:09,920
I don't think anybody really need advice

424
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,320
on which parts are you crazy you should
contain which parts you're crazy you

425
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,990
should let out

426
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,240
but you can start just as

427
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,530
as an entertaining project to play with
that line a little bit I'm

428
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,110
as I look around and see if you're
familiar faces in the audience love you

429
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,780
have been playing with that line and
it's kinda funny to watch on the Twitter

430
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,340
I am it's not rocket science

431
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,860
really bites sometimes showing that your
have a personality

432
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,120
that is not completely unattainable

433
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,160
regular people you know instead of
posting just the xkcd

434
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,590
cartoon I'm print out a few pages xkcd
explained

435
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,970
and post the next to the cartoon you
know

436
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,620
find a way to work for word from

437
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,169
that point where you are seen as an
outsider little bit spooky

438
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:04,880
to the point where your coworkers can
see you as

439
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
a fully rounded human that just has
different world's than they do

440
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
and here's something that's completely
wacky I'm

441
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,570
it's fun to play pretend it's not you
can pretend that you like things like

442
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:23,610
team sports you can pretend

443
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:29,990
that how your party's non-sport any

444
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:36,990
any sport that includes Word beers now
sport okay

445
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,690
for the benefit of the recording we're
hearing things like fishing

446
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,669
and pingpong as sport are you part in
the IRC

447
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:49,350
ok worker the

448
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,720
it's just sad

449
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,280
really I'm I'd it well no not cited the
if the audience was might

450
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,750
stalker be funnier I'm beaten you can
participate

451
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,360
in all those things that cause you

452
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,270
upset but increase the likelihood that
you can

453
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,590
in fact some your coworkers little bit
weird to right because

454
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,640
I mean these are people to play with
they don't know what but you know what

455
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,640
soaps toy with them and see how it goes

456
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I just have to pause for a moment
because this is my real issue these days

457
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,100
so %um bodycon apocalypse thing

458
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,940
I have actually gone

459
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,740
looked up the statistics on it because
in all likelihood it would be way too

460
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,610
hilarious but

461
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,720
count the number baby boomers that still
had most of their retirement savings in

462
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,610
mutual funds

463
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:00,710
high-risk investments are for the young

464
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,799
not the old current situation where

465
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,100
or do you just won't retire in your
future

466
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,640
looks like I'm this is going to be

467
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,549
kinda problem a we've all been reading
the articles hearing stories for quite a

468
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:15,650
while now that I've said

469
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,940
the boomers are gonna start retiring

470
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,370
every single population distribution
graph look like

471
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,380
right I mean if the boomers retire
there's going to be like

472
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,669
ama Julian jobs opened up but

473
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:36,669
the boomers are crap

474
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,650
we really need the audience Mike I did
you catch

475
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,740
but apparently was good so kudos

476
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,970
wanna trade I'm

477
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,150
because I I A

478
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,250
boomers they return there are times that
I had the money to

479
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,230
so there's lotsa people were sitting
right on the cusp a 65 for saying I

480
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,800
can't retire because I don't have enough
money for another 30 years

481
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,230
life I call that bad planning

482
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,390
I look to my parents generation

483
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,270
with the smug sincerity if someone has a
zero dollars say for their own

484
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,960
retirement

485
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,150
because people are passing away at 66
like they used to

486
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,310
because people are living well into
their

487
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,190
seventies and eighties and nineties and
further because they're healthy all the

488
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:28,610
way

489
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:33,620
you know that there's this guy rides his
bike on my neighborhood and the only

490
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,040
funny thing about it is that

491
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,540
his tee shirt says 78 and still running
faster than you

492
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,830
you can expect that

493
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,250
our generation so long as we spend a
little less time with caffeine another

494
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,320
recreational pharmaceuticals will live
in two are hundreds

495
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,770
so if you're gonna quit working half
with your life

496
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,540
you're gonna be bored a lot and
worsening the situation where

497
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,770
the future's going to be interesting the
boomers that we're going to start

498
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,410
retiring in the next year or so

499
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,990
aren't going to they simply don't have
the means because

500
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,480
statistically speaking proportionately
almost all of them had almost everything

501
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,590
mutual funds that went from value ax to
value

502
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,280
negative attacks make it a lot tax and

503
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,530
they can't the they can't maintain their
style life

504
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:26,960
so they're not going to I don't think
they're delayed forever

505
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,030
I think that those people will get sick
of work in another five years

506
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,879
maybe ten years but in the meantime
we're in this weird kind of sick holding

507
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,810
pattern where

508
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:40,440
nobody in the middle is gaining any of
the experience that they need

509
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,750
right when when senior and mid-level
executives

510
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:49,120
start retiring there's nobody who has
junior executive experience waiting to

511
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,980
take those shoes

512
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,290
so good is weird kind of funk

513
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:58,080
stop where we're gonna go from people
have tons experienced people have no

514
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,840
experience

515
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,140
in a very short period of time and the
longer the boomers fold-out

516
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,780
on retirement the tater that time lines
gonna look like

517
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,340
because that it its one of those
compression artefacts

518
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,200
right the front of the waves giving
compressed but the waves still going to

519
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,290
complete on time

520
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:20,159
what we gonna do about it

521
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,360
I think all of a sudden there's going to
be a huge call for a very senior people

522
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,930
are going to be any very senior people
slurs for putting very junior people

523
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,640
into the slots because they have to

524
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,990
they must or give up you could be ready
for that by being a well-rounded person

525
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,980
who knows the difference to democratic

526
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,350
readers our financial statements can
manage people even if they don't like

527
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,770
them

528
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,170
can get along with people has social
skills

529
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:51,580
according to my report cards I don't get
along well with others

530
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:56,950
this carries through for every time a
teacher had the opportunity to write

531
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,280
on a report card and

532
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,850
I've spent most of my adult life trying
to remedy you could spend some that time

533
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,210
too

534
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,750
learn how to make friends or have been
nice to other people it it's upsetting

535
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,170
feels kinda dirty when you do it

536
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:19,650
her

537
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:26,519
again for the better for the recording
we got in 0 year

538
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,690
is the other part in my big problem
these days

539
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,720
glass ceiling I'm

540
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
tuition others Gosselin to if your guy

541
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,850
knew there was a glass ceiling your hand
down your girl you know there's a glass

542
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,360
ceiling

543
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,980
you are so right its on real

544
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,980
and if your guys contribute to that
glass ceiling take yourself outside

545
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,000
inspectors of

546
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
there's a different kind a glass ceiling
here

547
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,870
are you have words there's a different
kind a glass ceiling worker though

548
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,060
this is the just because you know how to
do your job doesn't mean you know how to

549
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,710
do your job

550
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,918
and its almost one of those

551
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,699
completely predictable outcomes some the
problems I was talking about earlier

552
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,050
the completely predictable outcome love
you needing to be a skill set

553
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,050
rather than a person is that your skill
set

554
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,770
probably isn't going to matter few years
how many people are really really good

555
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,899
with Colin Farrell's

556
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:38,489
people

557
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,629
no but a lot about what installations
out there there you go

558
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:47,060
that's completely irrelevant skill thats
less than 10 years old

559
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,279
so how many people are on there

560
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,310
second third York career in their life

561
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,529
but every 10 years

562
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,880
to use to it so if you spent

563
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,810
the kawanzaa a reasonable dwelling in a
non metropolitan area on your education

564
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,080
prepared to spend it again in 10 years
and then again ten years after that

565
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,660
and ten years after that and so on and
so on until you finally shuffle off mark

566
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,140
Lowe

567
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,509
it's just the way it is a Sat Nav

568
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,930
requirements for the job that you want
in five or 10 years

569
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,210
is relatively unpredictable now and

570
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,760
ten years ago I had no idea that I would
need to pick up a skill set

571
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,320
that I'm missing now I gotta do it and
I've got to do the kind of a scramble

572
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,410
because

573
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:41,040
otherwise I'm I'm sorry stock get your
ass back in school

574
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,359
in fact don't leave school

575
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:49,390
it's kinda goofy thing to say but

576
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,890
it doesn't take much to stay enrolled in
a school one course is a master's enough

577
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,759
get your .eu email address which is all
kinds of fun

578
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,210
and it keeps you thinking

579
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,520
academically I didn't pursue

580
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,190
a education in what I do for a job now
so

581
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:13,099
my ritual education the only thing I'm
actually technically qualified to do

582
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:18,510
is corporate communications using slides

583
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,550
anybody remember slides

584
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,390
yet when I was in school this thing
called gold disc astound was new

585
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,390
will discuss down his knuckle PowerPoint
it looks like backed

586
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,060
ands I used to get paid to manually

587
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,460
insert little chips a plastic into other
little pieces of plastic and glass

588
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,490
and then put them this machine that when
could chunk everytime a change from one

589
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,080
to the other

590
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,970
and that's all I'm really qualified to
do I have a minor in

591
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,240
doing television commercials as well we

592
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,780
so for fifteen years of doing

593
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,060
not backed and it turns out that

594
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,080
15 years experience on

595
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,529
resume doesn't count as much as

596
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:11,530
two letters on a resume and or my
goodness is it frustrating

597
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,580
to be sitting almost four years old
applying for university

598
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,670
having to go back to your high school

599
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,359
and pick up a transcript twenty-two
years

600
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:32,359
after you left there hopefully for have
for

601
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,650
yes very awkward its

602
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,530
it's a serious pain in the neck the
other thing is that there's this

603
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,600
oddity ride sometime on my own stories

604
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,549
stupid there's this oddity in Ontario
where you can get a three-year college

605
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,510
diploma

606
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,910
that doesn't count as anything outside
Ontario

607
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,799
so in the states gotta stay calm
associates degree which is like two

608
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,550
years showing up somewhere during
general arts or something

609
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,210
it's not even as good as backed let
alone actually useful there's plenty

610
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,830
people wonder our three-year

611
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,740
for bachelor degrees and its kinda
frustrating I'm now I could spend the

612
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,250
next

613
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,490
three to four years my life remedying
that I have to

614
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:23,640
take to coop terms to get my degree

615
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:30,640
working as a information security
analyst

616
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:36,930
which I'm probably not qualify for yeah

617
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,430
it's another form of suck it up

618
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,919
so if you're not in school getting
school even if just one course

619
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,160
even if it's something that you've got
no idea what it's all about

620
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,540
get back in now while you still can
swimmer really tell you to do

621
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,240
one word and something that

622
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,280
as an industry we suck we suck hard

623
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,940
at this one I'm it. itself hasn't
changed demonstrably in 25 years

624
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,310
argue with that one if you will

625
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,900
two beers gone faster hard disk space is

626
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,119
got more capacious smaller uses less
power

627
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,890
but Smith reformer you know if you'll
have 10 terabytes

628
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:28,710
home you're not doing it right but I T
itself hasn't changed one

629
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,030
biota it still

630
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,560
exactly the same problems and we're
still solving them exactly the same

631
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,990
completely ineffective ways

632
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:42,040
what is what is information security
done that innovative

633
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:49,040
in the last decade I downloaded
Slackware on it

634
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,390
Dec lot network in like nineteen ninety
to

635
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,629
five record floppies that's not new

636
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,490
I don't have a beard your in 1992 or did

637
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,619
arm her which qualified me for the free
and open source movement at that point

638
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:09,740
bad and of course id3 tags in a database

639
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,780
home but

640
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,250
there's there hasn't been material
fundamental change information security

641
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:16,760
now

642
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,510
we just re categorize something that we
used to do as a new product

643
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:24,550
right how many people had outbound
firewall rule sets

644
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:30,580
in 2001 many people install DLP because
it's new and awesome

645
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,259
how is it different from about rule sets

646
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,670
thats

647
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,790
only true in this room because you guys
are also much more awesome than I am

648
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,859
her we're doing the same crap

649
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,380
we're still using passwords but nobody
can remember americans on a piece of

650
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,050
paper

651
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:53,960
we're still having an absolute cow when
we see somebody's gotta iPod connected

652
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,480
to their laptop because they're stealing
corporate data

653
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,040
or charging

654
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,820
we still have the same flip boats for
the same wrong reasons we still think

655
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:12,290
everything is an incident we still have
panic attacks

656
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:17,000
for no good reason we still don't
document or firewall rules

657
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,150
nobody knows why roll 14 is in there but
if you take it out

658
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:29,150
we're screwed as an industry we need to
change

659
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,260
and the only way to do that is for us to
change so this is my challenge to you

660
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:41,260
suck it up

661
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,160
right now

662
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,899
any time you walk into a meeting with
other people check your ego at the door

663
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,990
because you're not an expert

664
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:59,220
you don't really know what you're
talking about you know a little bit

665
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,020
about some stuff and in one area

666
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,140
you might be the world expert on it
maybe

667
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,310
but probably not for

668
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,660
every conference have been to the 100
speakers this five thousand people the

669
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,339
audience

670
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,390
more than half a hundred speakers

671
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:24,020
can be ok lost by 1. the audience
members ewbal proven the book last me

672
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,520
today

673
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,509
because you're smart is way better than
mine you're not a rockstar

674
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,500
man i've you even those %uh view are
actually

675
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:42,470
rock stars

676
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,730
you're not more important or better

677
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,160
than any other member the IT department
any other member the compliance

678
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,970
department

679
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,890
anyone who works in it. anyone who works
in the company just knock

680
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,759
your contributor often you're more than
just an

681
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,060
a little bit of a contribution often
your huge contribution

682
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,890
and you should wear that very quietly on
the inside

683
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,220
not very loudly in teacher

684
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:17,220
format

685
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,920
for the most part we're all really
really bad

686
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,300
this I'm really really bad I don't know
whether this is just

687
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,619
intrinsic in security or whether it's
something much bigger and much more than

688
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,230
that bytes

689
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:40,000
it's important that you understand
sometimes

690
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,340
blog review is just log review and you
know what

691
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,310
cannot do in that even though you tell
yourself you're doing it

692
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,970
you're not even doing it in a

693
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:57,150
Vega levy statistically valid way

694
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,859
you probably know where your locks
stored

695
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:05,210
or you're storing them locally or but
appliance the install three years ago is

696
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,720
still blinking but you don't know why

697
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,920
which is fine

698
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,119
because you can be your own experts and
and thats

699
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,230
admirable I guess but I challenge you to
not be an expert

700
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,790
I challenge you to leave the ego at the
door and

701
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,270
just put your ass back in your cube and
get something done

702
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,530
that's the real hard part because
there's that list of things that you

703
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,410
know you should do

704
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,490
right how many people

705
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,300
working an organization that prides
itself or or that you personally pride

706
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,820
yourself

707
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,550
on following best practices bullshit

708
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,089
you fall common practices

709
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:56,700
on days when it seems like a good idea
you sure as hell no you're not doing the

710
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,800
best job that you can

711
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,790
you know you're spending a lot of time

712
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,910
doing the same thing because I'll

713
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:10,270
we always put out this report our weekly
vulnerability stars for for

714
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,960
it's always get the same kinda numbers
on worse always vulnerable

715
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,650
SAR fault though

716
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:23,579
cuz you know computers are are

717
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,559
I'm tired my commutes long

718
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,930
suck it up to some work

719
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,940
to use I'm

720
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,290
you can do the same thing and get
different results

721
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,680
you can still show up at work and

722
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,740
get an outcome that is completely
different but you have to actually

723
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,550
want to change you have to actually
willingly

724
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:56,069
said it all side and say maybe I am
doing it wrong and you know

725
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:59,170
admitting that you can't do something
well is

726
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,480
effectively impossible for any of us
your written rock stars

727
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,160
but may be slowing down

728
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,629
I'm paying a little more attention to
not blink your lights

729
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:16,760
not shiny things and not weird esoteric
one in a million breaks that

730
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,849
technically possibly maybe could cause
bad things to happen

731
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:24,010
in a very special kind of universe where
I

732
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,329
is the true though that almost every
vulnerability that you've seen

733
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:31,260
last couple years has been like a
physics problem this only works on

734
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,329
infinite planes

735
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:37,740
in a vacuum were gravity doesn't exist
none of the stuff is real

736
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,140
but those of skills that you could spend
some time on

737
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,379
make yourself more rounded again not
trying to expand to fill the armrests

738
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,559
although if you do that requisition a
bigger chair

739
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:52,790
I found that to be very effective

740
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:57,540
spend some time learning business kill
stuff

741
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,670
there is great argument that happens a
different conference where

742
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:06,799
in I called Bologna on somebody loudly
publicly and

743
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:09,849
possibly intoxicated Lee I'm

744
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:14,460
be somebody at had asserted that it was
the job of someone else

745
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,150
to explain why some weird esoteric in
for a sec

746
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,990
point was important to the business and
my argument is

747
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:26,730
I don't care how junior you are if you
can't explain

748
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:30,829
why it's important to the organization
that you work for why this thing needs

749
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:32,900
to change why this thing is bad

750
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,940
you suck figure it out

751
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,369
okay the people that you work for the

752
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:44,660
mom let's face facts the chunky white
man that you work for

753
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,910
they make risk-based decisions all day
every day

754
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,220
that's what they do they're actually
really good at it

755
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:59,010
except if you work for BP okay not
really good at but the

756
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,299
the better at it than you are because
they actually know what it is that your

757
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:04,940
company does for a living and

758
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,329
if you can express your problems to them
in their language

759
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:14,819
they will be able to hear you but if you
express your problems to them

760
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:18,430
in your language there's no look at you
like you got a

761
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,839
heads and rate their password on on a
post it note and stick to their monitor

762
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,828
because you're making their life
complicated for no damn good reason

763
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:29,230
they would love to use a password is 14
characters long

764
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,520
and all lower case and you're arguing
that it has to be

765
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,210
characters long and mixed case plus
numbers possibles

766
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,280
well use

767
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,690
seriously suck at math because they're
equally difficult to break

768
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,030
so let them have the war find out what
it is that would make

769
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,299
someone in organizations like

770
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:55,530
easier and then make it happen good
example that one

771
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,869
here's here's how every full disk
encryption project fails

772
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:03,069
every corporation ever seen whole disk
encryption product to becomes the

773
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:03,770
15-page

774
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:08,339
operations guide level one sock

775
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:12,609
because your you're asking the
organization spanned

776
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:15,779
you know at least our learning how to
use this piece of software that

777
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:20,010
should make it so the organization is
more intrinsically secure and this is

778
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:20,530
almost

779
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:25,920
always because you didn't configure it
right so

780
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,099
a ready audience understands the whole
description works she has to be

781
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:29,990
hibernating

782
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,240
of for to work really well I'm

783
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,270
in into explaining to people the machine
has to be hibernating

784
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,490
of for to work really really well what
he just

785
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:45,650
do something really simple push GPO to
the entire company that says

786
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,859
systems only sleep for three minutes
from the going to have a nation

787
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:55,040
and tell your employees do everything
exactly the same we did it before

788
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,069
except when your machine comes on you
type in your password that screen might

789
00:49:59,069 --> 00:49:59,900
look a little different

790
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,380
here's an example what that screen looks
like

791
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,390
and you solve the problem it's now one
page

792
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,049
because you adapted to their behavior
its to asking

793
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,490
400 or 1000 for 10,000 people to adopt

794
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:19,020
to your idiosyncratic bullshit

795
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,910
it's an easy way to save hundreds of
thousands of dollars

796
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,859
that's security our ally right there

797
00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:30,040
it's easy to do you can find shortcuts
like that

798
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,130
every organization has hundreds of them
find them

799
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:38,420
make it happen teach people work in your
app development group that

800
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,560
they can do crazy things Lake

801
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,560
ask you for authentication but run their
own authorization

802
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,390
that's crazy it saves a time
implementation work

803
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,000
it's a za time have helped us work

804
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,339
it's simple it's little it's so simple
you're probably going it because you

805
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:06,000
want to buy something that has blinking
lights shiny things

806
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,060
but you just made money tried

807
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,089
right fine like a

808
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:16,140
and you really do owe it to yourself
right

809
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,509
because but the state information
security for the rest of your

810
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:24,410
career rest your work life or the go on
to something else

811
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:27,839
I think the lessons are all equally
applicable

812
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,950
you know you can get the job you know
you can do the job

813
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:37,770
but are any of us doing the job well

814
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:44,770
try to do the job well please

815
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:52,089
five minutes for questions they may have
a question

816
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:56,779
and a better start than I've got sure

817
00:51:56,779 --> 00:52:03,779
comment at some point

818
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:12,039
statement as even if you can't get a job
you can always do your own thing I work

819
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:12,469
for me

820
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:19,469
you should probably work for you too me

821
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,279
good point I can't possibly repeat of
that because I was really good

822
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,960
was written on its Mike handicapped
people the

823
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,530
general point is just do it good good

824
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,920
pass awesome that authority pass of some

825
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,640
comprehension it it sounds conspicuously
like working with

826
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,400
your coworkers might decrease

827
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:10,400
talk 0 ok I'm yeah front

828
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:29,940
okay most most important point is when
you come up with a problem you should

829
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,230
probably also have a solution with you
and the solution should be valid

830
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,950
otherwise you just created problems
that's a very good point if you can

831
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,820
argued affects then you probably
shouldn't be arguing for the problem in

832
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,470
the first place

833
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:46,599
real I'd I'd understand I can barely see
anything further back than about third

834
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:46,990
row

835
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,660
okay I got some be standing all you have
a joke on your shirts

836
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:57,660
that really sets you apart I do too

837
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:18,460
okay so the question is given that I've
worked in the financial situation space

838
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,849
to have any suggestions for getting into
the financial institution space

839
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:25,460
I'm I have one awesome suggestion for
you

840
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,670
Ron are

841
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,410
in terms of actually doing up I'm at the

842
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:36,750
at this for the regional bank level and
have to admit a reasonable amount

843
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,260
love functional ignorance I come from a
country that has same banking

844
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,010
regulations

845
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:44,080
I'm things are different here you've got

846
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,830
what 100,000 banks maybe two hundred
thousand

847
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:54,200
which is unusual because in Canada we
have five it's not because we're small

848
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,220
it's because they're big

849
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:59,030
I'm that so we tell ourselves fits

850
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:03,130
minor minor ego problem II the best way
to get involved

851
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:07,390
and and surrogate in and this is Khanh
almost all this is country code by

852
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,450
securing your before

853
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:12,210
the best way to get involved in getting
his tooth figure out who it is that

854
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,240
works in those places

855
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,030
and meet up with them hang out with them
this is the whole creating

856
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,690
a network of up associates in

857
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:25,130
most reasonable sized cities there's a
group of information security people get

858
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:25,849
together and

859
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:30,530
rancid each other you can find them
through which our religion is your

860
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,020
favorite

861
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,890
whether you're sounds kinda person or I
C squared kinda person or a soccer

862
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,379
person

863
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,460
you can find them that way sometimes
they operate outside about

864
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,280
the one that operates in trials call
task in its completely

865
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,359
unaffiliated with those crazy people but
that's where you could meet

866
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,750
the kind of people who work in those
organizations and creates create that

867
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,960
pathway into

868
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,420
the jobs that are never posted I E
opportunities that are never there

869
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,830
because they more than fifty percent of
the jobs in information security

870
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,200
never hits the news

871
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,750
because you don't want to admit you're
looking for an entire security team

872
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,060
right so you're hiring friend to friend

873
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,910
that's the best way to get in there
emails

874
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:23,569
front yeah

875
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:30,570
them

876
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,170
okay so the question is going from
interject analysts

877
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,530
but trapped because they're are no
senior level positions that have

878
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:55,250
responsibility authority in all
likelihood

879
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,290
the organization knows that it needs
somebody but it has no idea how to

880
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:58,990
implement that

881
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:03,760
home this happens public more often than
it should

882
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,850
but an organization sees that there's a
problem but they can't comprehend the

883
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:09,190
way

884
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:13,070
out of that problem so they're there to
serve stuck sitting going well

885
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,090
okay we could move left we could move
right by

886
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,170
we don't know how to move laughter how
to move right we don't know how to get

887
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,070
the right kind of person for that role

888
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,200
our experience with security people has
been

889
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,410
essentially the No squad the people were
brought up in for a sec to just simply

890
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,080
say no whatever the request was

891
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,500
and they don't want somebody like that
functioning up at the executive level

892
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,250
so from director level and up

893
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:42,210
you need to be a business person first
and technology or or subject matter

894
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,130
specialist 2nd

895
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:46,330
so during is Asian

896
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,430
are one of the ways you could teach the
organization that's what they need

897
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,540
is to be able to come up with their
language

898
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,920
business talk about what it is that you
do so

899
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,970
what what financial benefit would be
derived

900
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,560
from having a senior person responsible
is it

901
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,810
simply that you can reduce costs

902
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,870
is it that you can measurably reduce
risk

903
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:16,060
home is your organization when the even
talks about risk in a measurable

904
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,259
function away

905
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,620
if you ran the CMM on yourself as an
organization are

906
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:25,020
real security cm are you like -2
actively working against or you more

907
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,640
like one and change

908
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,420
it's up to individual superhero efforts
or is that the organization has made a

909
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,390
decision to say

910
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:36,470
which not gonna have a security
specialist securities everybody's job

911
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:40,370
that sounds like what you're saying is
that securities nobody's job which

912
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:45,020
is bad I'm but finding a way to make
that happen

913
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:48,430
all comes down to dollars and cents or
euros in

914
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:54,310
haris right you gotta convince the money
wise it's worth their while

915
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:57,570
absolutely or something

916
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:00,910
could be your absolutely

917
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:05,379
we use dollars in Canada to well

918
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:09,390
risk measurement yeah

919
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,379
risk measurement always gets hard
because different organizations approach

920
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,180
different ways

921
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:17,100
and security people with very few
exceptions

922
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,220
think they know how to talk about risk
but they really really really don't

923
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,100
see you need to approach from business
risk understand point so

924
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:29,740
whether it's whether it's that you start
by taking the course
