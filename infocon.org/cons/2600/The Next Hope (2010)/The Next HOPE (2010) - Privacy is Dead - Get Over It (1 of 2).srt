44
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,910
the basic stuff that a he is in fact

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,520
hour seminar

49
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,900
so I'm gonna do it like a speed freak I
would very much

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,880
appreciate no interruptions following
which there's gonna be a half an hour

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,959
Q&A I have three very impressive people
with me today will introduce them before

52
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:17,840
the Q&A

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,880
and we will jointly answer your
questions

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,130
this is privacy is that get over

55
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,470
with any

56
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,290
store it in court it is possible to
build a complete dossier also bought

57
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,500
doesn't matter what it is a social
security number America address and

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,540
email address

59
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,859
a license plate from that information

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,709
it's possible to discover everything
about someone sometimes you can only

61
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,140
wait one piece of information to another

62
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,820
sometimes you can grab things wholesale
know in the past

63
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,510
could help year

64
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,299
okay before we continue

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,840
I'd like to emphasize one thing
everything that we're going to be

66
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,060
discussing today

67
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,690
is open source or semi open source by
semi open source I mean

68
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,048
available to investigators available to
security professionals

69
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,120
probably available to half or more of
the people in this room

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,500
we're not going to discuss fence and
we're not going to discuss NC I say

71
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,090
we're not going to discuss any
governmental databases or anything that

72
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,490
is

73
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,810
by definition exclusive or closed we are
going to discuss what is available

74
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,100
easily and quickly on a future everyone

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,430
in this room primarily

76
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,630
we're going to be discussing the
information that you yourself contribute

77
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,520
the fast majority of the information
that's available out there today

78
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,630
is information that you gave up either
knowingly or unknowingly

79
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,320
you surrender that information your name
your address your phone number your date

80
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,920
of birth

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,550
your social security number your photo
which

82
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,950
once upon a time was the the holy grail
of Investigation

83
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,210
when I started out as an investigator

84
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,030
I would be paid five hundred or thousand
dollars to get somebody's photo

85
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:22,210
so he could be it. today all you need is
the Google somebody a

86
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,520
information like sexual orientation
politics finance

87
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,169
activities a business relationships
friends family

88
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,330
although it is open source these days
when I started out almost 25 years ago

89
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,880
this was confidential information that
you had to hire an investigator for

90
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,889
this is how it use the work

91
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,880
head a lot of what we're gonna be
discussing today

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,430
is gonna be how much things have changed
not just how much things have changed

93
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,260
since

94
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,060
I first started speaking at Hope but how
much they've changed in the past few

95
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,860
years

96
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,870
as an investigator

97
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,480
for example somebody would give me a
telephone number

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,240
from that telephone number I would get
the name and address everybody here

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,170
no set a policy here from there a good
day to birth and social security number

100
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,610
from there addresses family place of
employment businesses

101
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,590
real property marriages divorces
everything that's

102
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,510
public records criminal record civil
records

103
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,130
other semi public records are public
records driver's licenses motor vehicles

104
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,940
and so on and so on all love the
starting out with the warning piece of

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,240
information

106
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,250
maybe not a telephone number but email
address

107
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,260
address a neighbor to date of birth
that's how it use the big

108
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,980
you were taken in the first reviewed
start pulling and by the time you're

109
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,310
done you would have a complete dossier
it's over

110
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,010
and by the way I mean this much much
more I ran out of space on the

111
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,930
on the page today

112
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,220
not necessary today is start with the
telephone number

113
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,830
you plug in a telephone number and you
immediately get a comprehensive report

114
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,979
or a combo report or whatever it's
called

115
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,670
on the system that you're using i plug
in your phone number

116
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,330
and I immediately have your name address
social security number date of birth

117
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,609
driver's license motor vehicles family
residents history employment history

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,190
and so on and so on it's no longer
necessary to do it piecemeal

119
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,890
everything is cross-referenced
everything is available

120
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,930
in Warner goal of up

121
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,890
forget 124 air serb out there

122
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,150
let's talk about what's changed in the
past few years now

123
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,930
this says what's changed the past 10
years frankly let's talk about what's

124
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,920
changed since the last hope for

125
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,160
for civil computing power and speed

126
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,730
when I started over I had a Mac with 128
a floppy disk

127
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,800
I had to put in the program puppet a

128
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,520
save the data put in the program puppet
out

129
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,229
let me know you have four processes a
particular quad-core

130
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,480
whatever speed is unbelievable storage
is unbelievable

131
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,080
I routinely by more rare

132
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,919
that I had for in a hard drive

133
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,940
um you know I'm glad to see that that
people in the front few rows are

134
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,599
approximately my age

135
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,839
sometimes I talk about this too trainees
people in there

136
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,700
in their early 20s or becoming
detectives becoming federal agents

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,190
and a lot of this is is like talking
about the storage

138
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,230
storage per hour processing power

139
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,930
exponential increases a Department of
Homeland Security or understand

140
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,019
dropped by yesterday they save 75 years
in a row

141
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:05,360
%uh entry and exit in the US they will
never throw anything away ever again

142
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,320
everything is no additional from the
get-go everything is no digital from the

143
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,560
point of Inception

144
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,040
your medical record key did at the
nurses desk

145
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,390
your travel it's not a paper hand
written check it anymore

146
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,850
your credit card records immediately

147
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,980
you can I couldn't have somebody I can
do a charge over the phone

148
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,170
log on to my Visa account a/c the charge
within 30 seconds

149
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,420
everything is immediately digital and it
goes into the database is

150
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,099
just the square Nokia time for

151
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,209
or important because this is all about
money is your gonna say

152
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:46,140
Nokia costs your information is digital
from point zero

153
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,149
and it's in the database is immediately

154
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:54,269
but sorta all stuff OC or sucks it
everything

155
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:58,130
Google Books a newspapers

156
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,529
documents from 20 30 40 50 60 or 100
years ago

157
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:07,200
are fed into high-speed a she's reading
skaters

158
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,870
entire book can be done in an hour and
prettier care

159
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,470
cell phones were gonna talk a lot about
cell phones today

160
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,490
cell phones or whatever the three big
game changers we're gonna talk about

161
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,940
everybody here carries a cell phone
everybody here

162
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,180
without me check a carries a smartphone

163
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,360
very few people though be course you
carry these items are you use these

164
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,329
items

165
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:40,050
you never turn to morph or you can turn
them off

166
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,050
I know everything there is to know that
you're gonna cover this in great detail

167
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,449
cell phones are here a huge game changer

168
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:51,740
routine cross referencing name
translation

169
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,399
shovelers artificial intelligence
scripts

170
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,569
it's not just here's an address history
database

171
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:03,949
here's a telephone history database
here's a purchasing history database

172
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:07,910
immediate lease these things are
cross-referenced and linked by

173
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,509
every possible like I can't put in your
phone number

174
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,779
have your credit or charge us for the
next month for the last month rather

175
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:21,589
I could put in your phone number next
month with the Corrado

176
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,680
I could put in your telephone number

177
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,360
and from your telephone number have
olive your email address

178
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,829
and that's all heard of that was unheard
of a year ago

179
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:37,550
I could put your email address and have
your day

180
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,629
your address your telephone number 20
that now by the way

181
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,839
justly digress and say one thing

182
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,899
last year after that or we ago

183
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,930
the room and spoke an

184
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,240
unfortunately screwed the following
speaker %uh he got

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,269
about five minutes instead of what our

186
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:01,559
we are gonna finish on time today I Hope
but more important than that

187
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,209
um a manual and the crew have given us a
table

188
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,519
we are going to leave here go to a table
what are the things that we're gonna do

189
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,410
other than answer any follow-up
questions

190
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,469
that we didn't have time for during the
Q&A as I'm gonna let anybody wants to

191
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,120
come over and play with all of our
investigative databases

192
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,439
not just the stuff oh yeah to

193
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:31,599
listen as I'm gonna be discussing in
great detail over the next couple hours

194
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm a great believer in openness

195
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,449
I'm a great believer in PRI for your

196
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:43,079
there is nothing that I do that I'm
ashamed of

197
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,709
I think that I make the world a better
place or more just plays

198
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,259
I know these folks here do up it's not
like you see on TV

199
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,800
peeping in key roles in all other and I
want you guys to know and understand

200
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,800
what we do

201
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,009
s4s cross referencing and mashups and
all that let me give you one ridiculous

202
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,339
example

203
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,999
a call this comp start for drunks

204
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,819
there's something in DC costs double
safely

205
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:16,899
a guy chocolate the entire past couple
years

206
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,339
up crime reports and he took

207
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,870
the list of all the force and the
attorney area the say

208
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,490
and he just put them together took about
one evening a programmer

209
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,720
ID put up a thing called stumble safely
you can

210
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,279
checkup or and see how many bookings in
the area how many robberies how many

211
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,220
assaults

212
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,660
how many shootings you can determine is
that a safe place to get drunk

213
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:49,160
now for me this is a hilarious thing you
can check it out stubble safely dot com

214
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,059
this sort of thing ten years ago five
years ago three years ago

215
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,670
would have required a skilled programmer
would have required

216
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,850
massive outlays for data

217
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,160
a trained monkey could do this now and I
noticed some work for

218
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,319
no no just kidding for what else has
changed

219
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:12,439
GPS and the ability to attract you

220
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:17,180
Lissa your cell phone is glued to your
ass 24 server

221
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,749
because you're so photos with you I know
where you are or

222
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:25,399
we're gonna go into the great detail GPS
skyhook

223
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,470
people going around Google skyhook going
around

224
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,720
and mapping every wifi note in North
America

225
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,869
every single node

226
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:39,999
creation of new searching a new indexing

227
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:44,019
including translation including voice
the text

228
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,069
including video to text which I'm gonna
show you

229
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:52,559
which I find spooky and last but by no
means not least one or the other game

230
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,680
changes were gonna talk about

231
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,749
intelligent cameras with on board
analytics on board facial recognition

232
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:03,100
attached a massive high speed data bases

233
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,619
90 that earlier today there were

234
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:10,149
or over the past 24 hours there but
talks hearsay

235
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,449
yeah you can hide from facial
recognition databases

236
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:17,009
and you can opt out you can do this in
your know you care

237
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:21,129
know you care you care period I'm gonna
show you

238
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,290
I have great respect for the speaker
that was talking earlier today about

239
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,349
facial recognition

240
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,389
how you can dole arch the governmental
databases on the DL databases

241
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,420
you can't you absolutely kept an
investigator

242
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,610
doing this for 25 years do a lot of work
with law enforcement these guys a formal

243
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,300
or enforcement special

244
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,749
agents and state cops on their PRI's
forever

245
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:51,259
you can ask us all about it you can't

246
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:58,149
here another thing is ridiculously
accurate precision target market

247
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:01,429
the name of the game here guys is not
that there's people out there that a big

248
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,480
brother that want to invade your privacy

249
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,709
they want to sell your stuff this is all
about money

250
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:12,389
it's not nefarious it's not sinister
this is all attempted engine of

251
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,119
capitalism that's it

252
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:18,259
they want to sell your stuff they want
to know everything about you

253
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,839
so they could sell your stuff and it
results in your

254
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,040
each getting additional protocol
achieves a

255
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,660
this is no escape from her but it's not
a sinister motive

256
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,999
they want to sell your stuff they wont
to all your eyeballs

257
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:37,929
we're gonna talk about augmented reality
way to talk about it

258
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,309
a little bit with actual or method
reality

259
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:45,399
but we're gonna talk about other things
like their Google Goggles I don't know

260
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,449
how many if you're familiar with that
we're gonna talk about the

261
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:52,309
everybody wants to know what your cell
phone sees

262
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:56,649
so they're encouraging you to use it for
things like barcode scanner

263
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,699
%uh visual recognition of things like
pay pics

264
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,360
ornament that reality they want to know
that you're in New York

265
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,059
and you're at the Empire State Building
not just from OC or

266
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,699
and not just from your purchases and not
just from you buying a ticket through

267
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:11,900
your cell phone

268
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,209
but because you've taken a photo

269
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,220
other building and you've used augmented
reality no idea that building

270
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,939
and again its all about money

271
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:29,590
data storage costs somebody said this to
me about two months ago

272
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,428
this is a no lie air I don't know if you
can see this

273
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,590
thirty four hundred dollars for a
two-headed

274
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,928
Mag Drive for

275
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:45,100
a this is in my lifetime folks

276
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,580
I can go down to

277
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,860
the lowest form of life a state forced
tech sales

278
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,780
I can say give me your biggest desk

279
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,280
hunt for a hundred and sixty dollars I
can walk outta there

280
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,670
with a two terabyte desk I can tell you
when I started as an investigator

281
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,830
their wasn't 2 terabytes

282
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:17,379
up investigative data in the country
that's a fact

283
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,820
this was the reality not just what I
stored

284
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,870
but well into my career

285
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,150
the main thing that's changed one of the
main thing that's changed

286
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,600
there's no we're racing there's no
deleted there's no forget it

287
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,150
everything you've ever done every stupid
photo

288
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,220
everywhere Red Deer troll-like blog post

289
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,740
every drill good text message

290
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,790
everything is saved forever

291
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,909
forever it's safe and it's not just
saved

292
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:01,500
its index that its cross-reference at
its tied to your name forever

293
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,260
you don't believe it come by the table
later I'll show your

294
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,629
I mean

295
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,669
yeah baby right here

296
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,000
you know I

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,450
there's just too much to say about this
and I don't have to

298
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,220
at this is it only done by the
government everybody is familiar with

299
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,169
archive .org at the memory hole in the

300
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:29,220
Wayback Machine at Google cashing

301
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,110
at every effort by everybody to save
everything

302
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,429
you do it because first level if you
throw something away you don't know if

303
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:38,860
you're gonna need a year from now

304
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,750
and it's not like stacking up stuff in
your office

305
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,789
you just leave it on the hard drive and
every month butter or every week or

306
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,059
every hour an automatic text search
program runs

307

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,200
there's no denying desire for anonymity

335
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,850
the people in this room and everybody
else on the planet

336

at hope you will see we're talking about
stuff before it's even in the public

366
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,139
consciousness

367
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:28,350
we were talking about Twitter four years
ago twitter is now in the library of

368
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,529
congress

369
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:33,559
every tree has been turned over to the
library of congress

370
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,240
you think your tweets have disappeared
air

371
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,889
I can tell you that when I do a criminal
investigation

372
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:45,639
I hit LOC with the subpoena for all your
tweets

373
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:50,000
every tweet you've ever done guys listen
carefully

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,029
nothing you put on the web

375
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:56,179
anywhere not a tweet not a blog Notre

376
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:01,710
not SMS not a web page not a web page
that you delete 15 seconds later

377
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,320
nothing once you put it up there it's
Gordon

378
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,889
it shocked into a system its index
that's cross reference to you

379
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:14,809
and I can get it and you cannot get the
genie back in the bottle

380
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:18,168
if you don't want somebody to read their
six months from now

381
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:22,169

388
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,779

you put this on Twitter it's there
forever

397
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,409
by the way people are constantly sucking
down Twitter

398
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:31,450
all these people following your Twitter
feed

399
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,700
care for you don't know who they are let
me tell you those people or

400
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,470
their marketers their investigators and
the law enforcement

401
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,120
I wanna for I old people finder dotnet

402
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,840

405
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,769
by the way here's the components have a
twitter feed

406
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:03,480
you think it's just a 140 characters no
no no

407
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,460
it's your IP address it's your
geographic location

408
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,960
it's how long you've been a Twitter
member I mean there's a

409
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,190
30 for 4i think 3437 data components
that every Twitter feed

410
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,570
you think it's just for a you know we're

411
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,029
wherever that is shut up

412
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:27,360
don't do that again for I'm a sweet
lovable guy

413
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,039
but under-appreciated

414
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,440
for

415
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,639
let's let's let's talk about to enter a
little more for

416
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,279
all tweets from the date Twitter stored

417
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,630
are now at the library of congress they
or public

418
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,380
record twitter is now interoperable with
Facebook which

419
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,539
which is like huge privacy invader

420
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,908
moderate privacy invader hey let's get
together and be a mega privacy invader

421
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,370
every freakin tweet if you're stupid
often pressed the wrong button

422
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,090
is on your Facebook page I mean I'm this
is a new study buddy in this room

423
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,600
but think about it for micro targeting
of Twitter

424
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,289
for now here's something called

425
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,100
I think it's called the 140 proof for

426
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,559
there's an outfit called the 140 proof
you contact their

427
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,350
you tell them I wanna so products to

428
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,590
for senior citizen Chinese grandmothers
in Ames Iowa

429
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,519
for they will look through their Twitter
database and say

430
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,230
we have five hundred people we think
that you should

431
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,779
marketer they can Mike retarded to
Twitter

432
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:47,110
because they do what I do what law
enforcement does what everybody else

433
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,679
those

434
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,370
they gobble up your twitter feed

435
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,059
now for here's sort of vague corporate
version other

436
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,830
it's called followers for sale it's
probably somebody in this room I

437
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,899
wouldn't be surprised

438
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:04,340
for for 2497

439
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,440
you to batch of followers that fit your
criteria

440
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,659
he just pay him by paper legos probably
at the papal summer

441
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:15,799
minsk I don't know couldn't tell you but
for

442
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:20,929
pay twitter is not private for

443
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:23,940
let me give you a ridiculous example
I've hell

444
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,600
for the concept above what gets put on
the web is change

445
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,659
is a go by the name of us on a lawyer I
put this up

446
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,929
in 2008 it bears repeated

447
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:39,000
hospital I he was being harassed like
mad by the FBI

448
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,830
they really thought it was some kinda
terrorist the terrorist supporter

449
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,340
sympathizer supper

450
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,070
head he was really afraid they were
going to sweep up and

451
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,460
so the more of the Guantanamo because he
couldn't prove what he was doing for

452
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,809
well for he put up a website or tracking
transits

453
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:02,610
every hour he takes a cell phone for he
take a picture worriers

454
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,309
he puts a caption on for already
uploaded to his website

455
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:10,500
his entire life is on the were

456
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,169
course the FBI's no screwed for which is

457
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,340
his internet for me

458
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,110
this is bus or I wouldn't even think
over

459
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:26,049
but if you post for your every hour to
Twitter if you update your Facebook feed

460
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:31,240
if you if you are constantly SMS saying

461
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,690
this is an outside the door this is the
new nor

462
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,279
here for example present location on
Friday the 27th June

463
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,429
he puts up the map grid the GPS
coordinates

464
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,730
the photo at everything he was there
were

465
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,230
you know their my dad by the way if
Twitter is not enough for you

466
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,740
there's a there's orders this quick you
can upload photos you can upload

467
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,759
a live video feed you can

468
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:03,289
you can basically have your whole life
visible on

469
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:07,730
on the never head this is considered the
norm these days

470
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,379
this is the biggest change privacy

471
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:15,620
is dead because I essential you guys
have murdered

472
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,690
I N what it tries to come back to life

473
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,080
you'd drive a stake through its heart
every day for

474
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,210
here's a ridiculous example I mean
really

475
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,519
for WTF I mean it

476
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,539
I would say it on the DVD but you know
do a little

477
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:39,419
abbreviation translation would creative
more on users would be well let me tell

478
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:40,970
you millions of people

479
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,139
I don't know if you guys have heard
about this is a relatively new thing for

480
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:50,450
your knots why do you put your finances
and your purchases

481
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,919
in your tire shopping history
consensually

482
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,039
in the public domain by the way I want
you to see

483
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,110
how these how these weasels package
those

484
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:05,269
what's amazing is that millions above
shoppers fall for those

485
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:09,950
would you get her we've all been asked

486
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:16,419
sometimes we don't want them do but
sometimes

487
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:21,860
it's the spark that started interesting
conversation it

488
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,309
with you but you sure you purchase it
plans to share their purchases

489
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:30,428
you talk about new restaurants see that
he's your friends are back

490
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:33,450
yeah you get the idea well

491
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,360
by the way let me tell you have publicly
for the first month and a half its

492
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,830
operation

493
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,250
didn't realize that was be inspired by
go

494
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,759
so everybody is everybody's name these
are these are actual group

495
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,820
everybody's name everybody's purchases

496
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,269
and for a bit diet for excuse the is
this laser pointer for

497
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:57,529
this these things that are great out
there their issue a credit card number

498
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:00,580
in

499
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,620
know by the way if you want more a more
on

500
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,000
you poster information to something like
this

501
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,240
you deserve every bit of screwing that
you hear

502
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,940
either on purpose or by accident
millions of people are doing this

503
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,899
guys you heard it here first this is
going to be the norm for

504
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:21,820
and this is a really really valuable be
cool what's

505
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,009
10 things we're gonna talk about is what
used to be called the big store

506
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:31,139
what used to be called affiliation
marketing the bottom line is

507
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:34,309
whatever you like usual your fans like

508
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:37,470
however you vote usually your friends
vote

509
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,389
there is there is an interesting story a
couple weeks ago that the best way to

510
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:43,210
find that show up

511
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,960
is the go to somebody you hardly know
because

512
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,039
if you go to your close friends and say
hey I need a job for

513
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:53,120
you already know everybody they know
they can you know

514
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,749
turn you into any job openings you need
to go to people outside your circle of

515
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:57,809
friends

516
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:02,408
you or your friends that's why Facebook
is worth

517
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:05,490
is billions of dollars

518
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,999
anywhere moving over

519
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:13,419
another word swipe Lee for but by the
way

520
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:18,139
whoever names these companies should be
it should be killed

521
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:21,279
but but Libya and swipe Lee

522
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,860
this is the new obnoxiously nor

523
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,090
for there

524
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,759
the bottom line is for most the you guys
anything if any significant happens

525
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,990
have any significance happens in your
life you poster

526
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,009
you know we're for summer you guys have
got to be my agent you remember

527
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:46,340
philosophy 101 horrible core course when
you're

528
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,980
went to college in one other things is
this course

529
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,460
if a tree falls in the Forrester nobody
here's a

530
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,840
that it really fall for yes that their
tree of

531
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,879
but the new norm is if something happens

532
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:04,610
and it's not post that on the net did it
really happen for

533
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,379
everything happens ever what brought
this

534
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,270
to life for me let's see show Ahern's

535
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:18,418

over 45 percent at this rate

537
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:26,839
this is saddam hussein be a vote

538
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,409
i by the way as much as I love watching
this I could watch this twenty times a

539
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,730
day

540
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,090
let's let's move on but but but you need
to realize what this means

541
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,919
you know this is hitler in the bunker
for but somebody self over

542
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:48,029
everything that happens or any
importance any significance in the world

543
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,070
photographed videoed posted

of aiding intelligence whatever saver
crafted cover

659
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:21,869
there's a true story I gave a speech at
Cal Poly Turk Cal Poly promoter

660
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:27,160
as a you fix their what the the the
receiver was there were

661
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,750
OCR it's your folder

662
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,170
Cal Poly Pomona I gave a version of this
talk there for IT security people was a

663
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,730
sale sponsored conference

664
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:43,070
and the care the conference organizer
said yeah I went to your torque at work

665
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,190
on the

666
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,359
it was too generic find some stuff about
Cal Poly for

667
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,810
sorry for that there's a myspace group
the Cal Poly Pomona stores

668
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:56,549
they all use they all user part they use
part they talk about using it

669
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,930
you know right before class right after
class were rooms they made an unusual

670
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:05,940
and smoke and open to whatever and they
have their real names up there in

671
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,869
the morning after I gave the torque they
were all arrested cooks often

672
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:14,270
understood I have nothing against

673
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,540
personal Park use nothing against

674
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,420
i've a lot I guess you know supporting
Mexican drug cartels ur

675
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,230
all the other obnoxious stuff like
dealers getting sharm

676
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,130
what have you I do believe it's kind of
a gateway drug but

677
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,119
I don't care about this people their
problem was not that they were drug

678
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:34,650
users

679
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,430
there were more its for

680
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,859
know it's got a little service people
put stuff

681
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:46,390
up on the way up that's pain for

682
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,810
that is the most private horrible stuff
and I don't understand

683
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,170
but this is the new nor her putting it
appears an example

684
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,270
here's this apparently sweet young girl

685
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,550
who got abused by her family and lost
heard your report before

686
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,609
up before the boy was born for

687
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:08,730
when she puts the young boy's name up
there much lost that her name and

688
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,320
everything

689
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,320
and head it's paid for

690
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,900
but this is the new norm here's a woman
I highlighted the so you can read it

691
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,230
she talks about her she was sexually
abused by her family

692
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:25,520
her she was a hooker her she talks in
the 2nd Graf down there

693
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,609
for second one down her she'd be to curl
conscious with rock

694
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:35,049
I mean this is a real understood got
MySpace page

695
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:40,440
here is a rape support group which is
not a close group on MySpace

696
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,600
anybody wants the conjoined it a this

697
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,190
this water in the middle order /url I
had no problem

698
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,300
a terrifying her I mean to shoot really
want the world to know the details of

699
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,040
her rape

700
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,560
apparently she does by the way for

701
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,380
for those a view in this audience that a
law enforcement or investigative

702
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,210
professionals

703
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:07,430
for if you don't use this stuff for your
cases it's gonna bite you in the ass

704
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,430
here's a guy we've talked on

705
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,470
myspace about wanting to hurdle bomber

706
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,300
any head Ku Klux Klan videos on this
page in their

707
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,369
they later arrests that have actually
planning a hip hotel bar but with

708
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:22,119
another

709
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,180
again headed skinhead body of urs

710
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,200
die like this guy this is the one guy
that I like

711
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,850
for server

712
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,080
he II care

713
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,350
read it well from their concerts trainee
on the presenter screen

714
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,770
but he basically says anybody who reads
the Sun you know decides the fire me

715
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,570
because at my myspace page

716
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,280
shea butter I mean this is a guy who
knowingly an opening were

717
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,440
open later puts up his webpage

718
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,730
now for by the OK for shame on me but
it's not going to happen for

719
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,850
what are the big questions is who are
your friends

720
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,770
because if I know who your friends over
I know everything there is to know about

721
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,990
you

722
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,180
and that's what Facebook is all about by
the way on the most basic level 5

723
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,410
investigating you and I want to know who
to interview

724
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:18,868
for I just got a Facebook page in
MySpace page a Twitter feed its whatever

725
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:23,850
and I see we are in constant contact
with and I go visit them immediately

726
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:29,790
purpose so it's a for mostly I don't
need to anymore

727
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,520
on Facebook alike on MySpace the stats
or and I can tell you from

728
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,560
investigations this is true

729
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,600
subscribers use their real names their
religious

730
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,190
year give or take a few years their real
email addresses hobbies their taste her

731
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,150
interest

732
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,030
and links to their real notice the guard
froze

733
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,850
by the way here depending on whether you
believe

734
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,810
myspace is BS claimed over 125 million

735
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,320
active web pages which I have to tell
you I'm sure there's

736
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,119
exaggeration at least by for

737
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,250
$50 million a Facebook is he the three

738
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,670
or ten times as big as MySpace I meet
facebook is now

739
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,740
one-stop shopping for anybody wants to
know everything about you

740
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,760
and by the way they are a much smarter
data vacuum

741
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,430
Facebook and likes Facebook Graph

742
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,720
all that crap tells me everything you're
interested in

743
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:36,720
that everything your friends are
interested everything for

744
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,869
this is an example of something that
Facebook does for

745
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:44,940
and and and the balls have these people
are basic you press the wrong button

746
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,200
when you signed up

747
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,230
they suck their on your whole address
book that they send the invitations

748
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:56,250
up just signed up on Facebook if you're
ready on friend them if not for

749
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,540
signed up and hang out with over

750
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,130
5 100 million Facebook pages

751
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,940
twenty percent of all internet users
worldwide

752
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,980
something like forty 3 percent

753
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,940
of all americans that use the in order
now to Facebook page

754
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,700
this is a minor boggling level of
penetration

755
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,780
mind-boggling they are the Walmart on
the internet for

756
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,890
the average user span this over an hour
a day

757
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,069
for people who spent five hours a day on
Facebook

758
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:35,100
I mean my written as wood burner butter
but for

759
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,260
that's that's how it works by the way
for

760
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,859
the big privacy you know Facebook
invades privacy the big privacy

761
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:44,799
hullabaloo about Facebook

762
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,830
during that whole hullabaloo 36,000
people

1029
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,200
you're going to use it use Gmail Chris
gmail is simple

1030
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,600

it gives you a gazillion gigabytes to

don't throw away your email archiver

1033
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:11,370
where the hell do you think that is
because they love you

1034
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:14,609
because they want to give you five gig
on their servers

1035
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:19,630
because sergei discovered is your third
cousin

1036
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,830
he wants all your email their to be

1037
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:26,400
index to be searched to be
cross-referenced so they have a picture

1038
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,440
of you

1039
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,109
so they or you're our balls so they
understand your eyeballs

1040
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:35,120
if there's a hundred emails back and
forth between you and somebody they've

1041
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,270
identified as your mom

1042
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:41,900
about kidney cancer they know either you
or your mom is kidney cancer

1043
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,759
probably the algorithm knows which one
of you is

1044
01:06:45,759 --> 01:06:48,810
gmail is great and by the way

1045
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,230
they may not report your IP address but
they absolutely

1046
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:55,960
offer your IP address

1047
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,529
Google Goggles is unbelievable it's an
example of words go

1048
01:06:59,529 --> 01:07:03,420
for what the heck is this

1049
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,799
who show up for

1050
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:11,160
okay for Google provides a free 411
service

1051
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:15,000
they provided Voice to text

1052
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,509
why do they provide voice to text

1053
01:07:18,509 --> 01:07:21,819
because if you take advantage a voice to
text

1054
01:07:21,819 --> 01:07:26,430
by the way what you don't know is local
converts all your voicemail messages

1055
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:29,830
to text even if you don't use that
service

1056
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:33,089
why because it's another window into
your soul

1057
01:07:33,089 --> 01:07:36,520
somebody leaves a message a buffer a

1058

there

1060
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:48,730

phones

1069

they know where you are within 10 feet
all the time for

1070
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,350
for cassese

1071
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:39,490
right location-aware Google Maps

1072
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:43,630
what you don't realize is Google Maps
are now location-aware

1073
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:47,210

01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:51,910
thats sink not just on your phone which
you probably already know about

1075
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:56,139
but even on your laptop these are
location-aware devices

1076
01:08:56,139 --> 01:09:02,839
let's talk about latitude I don't know
how many views were deterred

1077
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:06,540

1078
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,560
know that it constantly buffers your
location and saves it for ever

1079
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:17,560
you can delete it so it doesn't show up
for Google still saves for

1080
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,210
for here's an example of what's being
developed not gonna tell you this is a

1081
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:27,589
brilliant program this is a functional
program

1082
01:09:27,589 --> 01:09:30,790
this is our own believably privacy
invading program

1083
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:34,710

location

1085
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:43,580
you could tell geo crowed to send your
wife in SMS

1086
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,799
when your train is about to pull into
your home station

1087
01:09:47,799 --> 01:09:51,740
honey come pick me over

1088
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,849
frankly it's a brilliant programmer

1089
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,860
enormous functionality terrific
functionality

1090
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,570
you've got a 14-year-old daughter for

1091
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:05,860
you know she's been seeing a bad
17-year-old girl for

1092
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,059
you could have her phone send you a text
message

1093
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,590
she's on her way davidians house for

it absolutely were

1098
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:33,760
Google is brilliant in that it not only

1099
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,560
makes its programming open to the world
%uh light

1100
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,980
the mirror I like the new brought that
up over but they

1101
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:44,060
you view photo shoot early they give you
poor kids

1102
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:49,130
they give you access the API's they want
you to write programs

1103
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:55,060
third helps invade the privacy helps
document every single activity

1104
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:59,550
other Android phone users

1105
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:03,340
now this is what they use the search
Google Chrome most the user experience

1106
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,090
takes place on the web

1107
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:08,090
that's not what they say anymore for

1108
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,100
they know most the takes place a cell

addition network to put together a
diverse

1113
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,000
Google will know you know it's like to

when your home tells a lot about you for

1120

that Apple has a huge iTunes penetration
the start a Google Music and I guarantee

you're gonna have Google Music on
Android for and they're going to give up

1126
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,330
a run for their money which

1127
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:12,980
a good spanking Steve Jobs

1128
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:16,610

1129
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:20,349
Google power in mir ich yes folks

01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:27,990
to more and more people they've started
a public utility

1132
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:32,080
they're gonna sell power they're gonna
know how much power you use and what you

1133
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:32,980

1139
01:12:52,429 --> 01:12:57,190
to Sky rider they will be able to tell
by our search for power

1140
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:01,639
consumption other refrigerator you open
the refrigerator door

1141
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:05,800
you've close together you've got back to
your TV you've turned the journal

1142
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,400
Google TV you've got into the bedroom

1143
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,700
their are

1144
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,950
this creeps me out beyond belief

1145
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:19,000
it's not a secret you can go to Google
Twitter

1146
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,030
to Google Books Google will tell you
about what they're doing

1147
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:27,540
Google true for Google wants to know
everywhere you go

1148
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,620
they just bought a troubling a traveler
recommendations for

1149
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,139
Google News we've talked about the for
this a

1150
01:13:36,139 --> 01:13:39,910
bit like everybody here uses be it.
dunno why bitly

1151
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:46,179
everybody uses for if right click on a
bit link and it sends me to

1152
01:13:46,179 --> 01:13:50,810
spank me don't cover boa keep using that
as an example though read anything at

1153
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:55,770
for 0 I gotta say they cover

1154
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,950
if you use quiet whatever you about the
side of the spektr

1155
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:03,969
if you use bitly every URL

1156
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:08,540
every shortened URL that you click on
tells me something about you

1157
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:11,730
who hates that Google goes and knocks

1158
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:15,700
when somebody knows something about you
that they don't know

1159
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:19,360
so they've started gooo GL

1160
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,190
they now have a for /url shorter URL
sure

1161
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,790
shorter and one other things that if
you're paying attention

1162
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:31,530
you're gonna say is Google does things
to screw up or

1163
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,800
and Apple closely those things the screw

1164
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,940
purple as you're gonna see when we get a
terrible new version of Safari

1165
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:44,560
strips out here its those Steve Jobs do
that because he loves you

1166
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,110

1167
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:53,769

it's it strips out all the Google Alerts

1168
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:59,750
pretty freakin smart Google does the
same sorta for

1169
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,969
Google for Lissa

1170
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:07,210
I like playing Mafia Wars I admit

1171
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,840
I'm not gonna play Mafia Wars anymore
because if I do

1172
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,650
for guru is good though how much time
iPad spending

1173
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:19,080
a Mafia Wars all love the really
disreputable things I do while I play

1174
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:19,610
both

1175
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:22,710
Mafia Wars sorry for

1176
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:25,770
they have no bort a for

1177
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:29,790
I nobody really knows if it's a
controlling share just a monstrous

1178
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,130
couple hundred million dollar share in
in

1179
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:36,330
the company that publishes both for
yours

1180
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:40,370
Google Wave again for

1181
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:45,160
Google is a prelude company a
frighteningly brilliant company

1182
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:50,440
say CNH they develop the best possible
product for

1183
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,090
and a user to suck every bit of
information they care

1184
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:57,469
how many people here views Google Wave

1185
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:02,059
more than here for the river it's a
great service is a phenomenal service

1186
01:16:02,059 --> 01:16:06,700
incredible collaboration facilitation

1187
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:11,090
but think about what it owes about you
when you use that whiteboard

1188
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:15,960
when you watch a video together when you
collaborate on a product sending it back

1189
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,719
and forth

1190
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:21,700
for it's as if Google is part of the
collaboration

1191
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,370
drill year functional fantastic product

1192
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:30,420
sucks every bit a privacy here

1193
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,840
listen guys Google has its over

1194
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,360
freakin satellite for

1195
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,019
sky to sky to it's good

1196
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:44,510
Lissa I'm not a paranoid guy I use this
stuff

1197
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:47,760
I use this stuff for my older purposes

1198
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,969
I recognize this is all an engine of
capitalism

1199
01:16:50,969 --> 01:16:54,830
Google is wonderful what they do a

1200
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:58,449
carport Google stock as a result I use

1201
01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:02,960
a torta their products I've gotta tell
you

1202
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,120
everything you do is sucked down by crew

1203
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,170
for

1204
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:13,310
Google has a no if

1205
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:16,730
rare for not not not servers

1206
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:20,510
Google right now their server farms

1207
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:25,300
have enough rare to save

1208
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:28,590
the entire were

1209
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:32,060
think about other that's not an
exaggeration I can make that up

1210
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:38,739
it's really true that just gives you an
idea of how monstrously huge their

1211
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:42,120
day or they shared storage not

1212
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,610
on the driver or the server rack basis

1213
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:51,309
but all the facility basis and they play
a server forms

1214
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:57,679
not a square feet butted acres and it
served by their own fiber-optic

1215
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:01,659
they have their over dedicated networks
powered

1216
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:04,969
by their own power company for a

1217
01:18:04,969 --> 01:18:09,600
hurts kinda for for

1218
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:15,830
now for 2006 2006 and a half my 2006

1219
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,120
talk to a little interrupter per 2006

1220
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:24,409
a I'm I said the day will come

1221

said about your privacy while using
Google the Internet giant says it

1436
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:07,340
understands

1437
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:11,680
Google is now offering users a chance
opt out and live in privacy in a remote

1438
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:12,820
mountain village

1439
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:16,670
tech trends reporter Geoff Tate has more
thanks Teresa they call it

1440
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:20,210
the opt out village and it's just
wouldn't expect from Google

1441
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:23,690
if you want to keep your information
private all you have to do his move to a

1442
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,490
22-acre

1443
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:27,969
opt-out village and not speak to anyone
from the outside world it's very simple

1444
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:32,180
just go to the Google front page click
the art out but and the minutes a van

1445
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:33,750
will come to your house and pick you up

1446
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:37,820
that same day to the privacy experts
eliminate your home yes there

1447
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:41,080
18 it will no longer appear on Google
local pages

1448
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:44,130
and after just two days in the back of a
van you're there

1449
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:47,200
in the village we can guarantee that
there's no chance

1450
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,360
reading emails because there are no
computers and because they're also

1451
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,950
monitored and tracked by Google there
are no banks

1452
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:56,130
or hospitals residents will be expected
to know how to grow food

1453
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:59,810
suture wounds and bury corpses by hand
if they plan to opt out

1454
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:03,680
and Google is gone the extra mile to
ensure that users who choose to opt out

1455
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:06,000
are given complete privacy in their new
home

1456
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,960
a thirty foot tall ten-foot think
physical data security wall keeps allo

1457
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,280
allo

1458
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:13,670
little users from leaving the village
until they decide they wanna start using

1459
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:14,700
Google again

1460
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:18,830
the availability can be seen by rule
satellites because the entire town is

1461
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:21,590
enclosed in a large metal box with no
openings

1462
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:25,190
google says those wishing to Outback
into using Google after their time in

1463
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:25,730
the village

1464
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:29,360
will be allowed to do so if they agree
to be branded with the whimsical G on

1465
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,290
their foreheads to label them doubters

1466

gonna give us complete access to your
most private thoughts and feelings

1467
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:35,240

1468
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,410
you can just toy on the hinterlands and

already getting rave reviews what the
first village residents sent this letter

1471
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:45,719
praising the total privacy

1472
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:49,520
inside the village saying all alone no
light hard to breathe

1473
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,910
and that's one man whose data is secure
for the Onion News Network

1474
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:58,570

questions about the opt-out village type

what I want you to understand is grew it
now for

1481
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:28,009
moving on Google is not the only company
that does this

1482
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:32,890
your eyeballs are worth money not just
the Google but everybody else and now
