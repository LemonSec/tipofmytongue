1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,549
yes so they're they're nocturnal the
mammals

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:09,450
and they echo locate for the most part
actually it's a very large

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,900
the main difference pieces abouts and

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,119
this is a a member of character

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,970
micro corruptor which means it's small
and

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,229
its insectivorous saves more for later
but not all about sexually aka locate

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,000
their son the record with spring baths

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,660
just whisper as and it's very difficult
to pick up the colocation call

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,460
and it in a rebel faction that is
smelling that in the fruity dingbats

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,040
instead

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,420
anyway so here that befell and the talk

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,440
on a deuce some words buzz words meaning

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,260
we threw them in fact we're talking
about because Dixon sonar

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,449
we will all talks about echo location

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,440
and then I'm so I say private in a row
science really I don't go too much debt

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,960
that all

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,680
we can go into more depth you're
interested and so

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,420
in that sense I want to talk to be such
that you can interrupt any moment if I

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,250
say something that's very unclear

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,310
or you'd like me to go into more depth

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,369
their questions at the end but if it
waits for that long if you don't have

22
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,770
been a paper you'll probably forget

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,699
and so I think we might mean for funeral
as needed so

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,640
reversing biological systems as the
theme actually don't have sides to that

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,200
and

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,810
but will talk a bit more as I go

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,049
it's sort of a pervasive or a the
presentation and then all talks about

28
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,189
setting the sonar beam

29
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:39,360
but thats cute words

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,320
so has entered every once in his words
before

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,920
yeah by a medic so video paramedic

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,570
is there something that mimics a
biological system a

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,790
even at the cost love

34
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,899
some suboptimal idiot the system so to
be clear up to melody

35
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,409
is to find a suspect some some criterion
for example

36
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,490
want to minimize power consumption want
to minimize weight

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,099
we want to maximize flight time

38
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,369
furtive parameters it's the opposite
respect to those paramedic doesn't seem

39
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,000
to do that it seeks to mimic

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,720
the political system example project is
a robotics tomorrow

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,109
I may not be pronouncing that correctly
it's a type love see that has a wing on

42
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,129
a single blade

43
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,349
I'm sure you've seen them outside before
the fall from a tree in spam

44
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,349
demands their own others you can pick
them up and make them do it again

45
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,079
there's a group that there is a maryland
that found out the physics involved in

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,230
that and then made

47
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,780
a robotic implementation so it's a
single blade

48
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,890
helicopter we could look at videos after
the talk

49
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,599
if you're interested and I have links
and so on a plausible is something

50
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,609
that could in principle be implemented

51
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,560
in a biological system but not
necessarily this word is a bit abused

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,050
its abuse because when people think

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,519
of something being parallel in acquiring
small computational units they think

54
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:02,769
that

55
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,800
well the commitment and particle system
son so in the case

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,720
up but still that's the meaning of this
word something that might be implemented

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
in some political system

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,260
usually these this work is modeled by

59
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,540
air with for through some

60
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,650
existing system example use visual
stabilization

61
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,920
for flight inspired by or

62
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,540
guided by vision models up the fruit fly

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,659
Drosophila the run a few votes very
small the pop-up

64
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,929
all over the place for those fruit and

65
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,890
bio-inspired so its work this is a
learned about a medic as in your

66
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,569
building something that's similar to the
system but you try and make it better

67
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,010
so example up

68
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,548
a gif years can't go for it adhesive
this is a project to Berkeley

69
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,680
geckos can walk on walls

70
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,370
and ready for the president isley
there's a group there that studied

71
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,390
that in geckos but in particular
attended extended in a minute

72
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,560
in a and synthetic material an event for
the good success

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,200
acoustics

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,980
Chris series of hands are clapping
thumbs up

75
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,530
if you know for EA free transfers for a
series very good

76
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,579
K so the basic idea for those who don't

77
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,820
is your given some signal are some

78
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,199
way form and you want to express it in
terms of sinusoids

79
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,400
assign you saw it and so I don't have a
laser pointer some use the mouse

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,160
doesn't show up so the top Rome

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,660
so a reference the silly one described
as blue

82
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,389
rectangle wave you can begin

83
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,910
by finding a sinusoid a particular
frequency a low-frequency that's very

84
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,850
similar to it

85
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,600
of course it's for the poor
approximation we can add another

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,380
sinusoid which is the next row

87
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,949
and you get a little better you can
continue to add saying you so it seems

88
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,259
the you get

89
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,590
a very good approximation to the signal

90
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,590
is that clear so far okay

91
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,750
and that's significant because give us a
monetary signal you can talk about

92
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,639
spectral content

93
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,919
that as I can give you I could snap and
you can record it

94
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,490
and decompose it into the sinusoids

95
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,699
well regularly a free chance from as a
continuous

96
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:27,070
definition a frequency but you you get a
sense a spectral content

97
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,050
creeks are special person as a special
because they have really high frequency

98
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,570
counter

99
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,320
even though you may not think so is so
suddenly

100
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,659
our it's because it requires a large
number

101
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,710
sinusoids you can be Inc intuitively to
represent that very sharp peak

102
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,380
intensity so let's look at some examples

103
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,389
only to actually this is a sinusoid a
tone frequency its 100 hurts

104
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,240
degrees in the top so signed two times
pi

105
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,910
times to you which is time times 100
risk is that the one hundred hertz

106
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,669
the axes are that's the labels are small

107
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,020
sought to you about them that's

108
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,190
peak to peak have to and the time and
you see is from 0 to 30 milliseconds

109
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:23,020
so 100 hurts that means every cycle
complete internal seconds

110
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,258
so we were given some signal we want to
visualize it

111
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,569
the right ways to do it this is it says
the general problem with

112
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,840
studying data how do we look at it and
one way to look at it

113
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,860
acoustic data is something called a
spectrogram

114
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,169
which shows frequency content with
respect to time

115
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,008
that is on the x-axis we have time on
the y-axis we have

116
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,699
frequency in the colors indicate
intensity

117
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,949
so red would be more intense blue 0 or
very low

118
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,530
and so from that tone for you can see
the years the devotees when it hurts we

119
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,680
get the spectrogram which is a solid bar

120
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,650
it 100 so over time it's

121
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,789
it's always one hundred hertz a constant
frequency

122
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,669
with the more complicated function like
this one for decreasing

123
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:14,330
the frequency an exponentially
increasing rate

124
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,770
it's not obvious well we're looking at
so it's a constant amplitude

125
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,120
we can see that from this plot but when
you look at it

126
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,580
here and this is something this some the
shape here's an artifact of the

127
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,270
rendering

128
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,280
program can you but but you

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,580
when you look at it it's not obvious but
the content is

130
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,859
and this is a good example because when
you're recording something

131
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,729
some sound course or it doesn't have to
be sound anything we've seen the

132
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,550
frequency content you might not be able
to understand it just by looking at the

133
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,740
time waveform

134
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,000
but I'm reform I mean the horizontal
axis is time

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,740
vertical axis intensity

136
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,229
but if we look at the specs again
because much more clear what's happening

137
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,020
so x-axis is timely access frequency
again

138
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,310
and now we can see the peak frequency
content is decreasing

139
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,629
exponentially

140
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,669
haven't forgot about that if you look at

141
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,940
plots voices human speech which I don't
have any size on that bridge that we can

142
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,349
do it after the talk together

143
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:23,150
or otherwise there are harmonics will
get to see a

144
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,000
harmonic we look at about a causation
but there's much more respect for them

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,720
this is our contract examples to make
the point

146
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,039
and as a side note another we'll see
these represented often

147
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,789
is with the logarithmic axis that means
for every step

148
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,860
on the y-axis there's a change in order
magnitude

149
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,380
that's done because in the cochlea human
cochlea and was million Coakley herbs

150
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,529
the frequency distribution is
logarithmic

151
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,600
so from fact

152
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,970
okay so sooner well

153
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,380
has a room feel like a stick so far we
just barely touched on it

154
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,360
and emission is something very
fundamental but I assumed you'd know

155
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,930
sound

156
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,170
is a pressure wave so what i'm talking
right now I'm causing

157
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,620
compressions and their factions near has
picked up my microphone which is

158
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,380
actually

159
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,740
to be on the construction moving with
the pressures

160
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,709
there's pressure changes okay has picked
up by quayle

161
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,430
again to be on construction as a signer

162
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,510
we want to do detect something in the
field in the field beam

163
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,980
in space and the

164
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,610
this is a basic instruction ovett I miss
some sound

165
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,940
every for some time and I get something
back

166
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,589
now supported %uh this is continuous as
an as i'm talking now my sounds

167
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,089
engineering are coming out my mouth if
you to visualize it it's like the

168
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,339
strings coming out

169
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,440
when I stop it propagates through space

170
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,500
game and when it comes back I get the
front love it

171
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,430
so-called wavefront and then the rest
follows them like spaghetti

172
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,959
if you say that the string algae

173
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,290
so let the beat I messes the minutes in
ours was received

174
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,610
suffocation usually is to assume that
we're getting back is a delayed copy for

175
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,240
you sent out

176
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,529
that's not true because the visual scene
is much more rich

177
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,589
the mess but to a fair approximation

178
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,940
we let that be the case %uh so we know
the speed of sound

179
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:31,940
roughly and addition approximation to
getting distances to see this delay

180
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,149
so over the equation a bit strange

181
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,550
here so cases time delay case it and
lets the flight time from when I

182
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,970
emitted doing something came back and
case related to distance and speed of

183
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,050
sound like a cause

184
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,130
2d oversee distance

185
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,000
d is the distance between me anything
that I'm vocalizing on

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,720
so 2d because there's trip their trip
back

187
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,800
okay

188
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,149
so how do we detect it means coming back

189
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:10,829
not so simple a general approach to make
a cross-correlation

190
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,890
does everyone or anyone know
cross-correlation

191
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,399
yep say given some signal an

192
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,180
so I don't have any graphs this I waited
rain equations as much as possible just

193
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,769
to

194
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,399
try to get some intuition im lookin

195
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,630
a plot soon but basic idea of
cross-correlation is a given some

196
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,740
function being

197
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,870
you can become a hand that function and
even some other function

198
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,329
which looks different cross-correlation
is when you

199
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:41,380
look at them together and multiply them
by each other

200
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,540
so for example the cross-correlation
function

201
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,149
as a function of time if we begin at 02
time

202
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,850
which means the road time difference we
line is too

203
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,839
and integrate them we must play them in
in a bit over that

204
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,480
result is something some particular
value and you can repeat as the

205
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,800
different delays which means I'm

206
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,100
you're so effectively sliding one
function across another

207
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,940
you getting these values out

208
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,110
so intuitively when they're aligned if
they were the same

209
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,660
well so this was the other shape when we
get to a perfect alignment

210
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,610
and then multiply them in effect in the
end in a great we get a fairly large

211
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,529
value

212
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,850
to the idea that intuitively is
cross-correlation as a way to pick out

213
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,230
somewhere in this given two functions

214
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,680
so here's an example %uh x-axis is time

215
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,329
on the left we see time way forms that
is

216
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:42,620
some energy intensity whatever you like
to call Alexis with respect to time

217
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,920
on the right is the a cross-correlation

218
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,190
so first we have this tone frequency
thats on

219
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,269
the two seconds and a little after 3
seconds

220
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:56,360
in the top left 30 know it's you can
tell that because the line is flat

221
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,200
aside from that the rectangle burst is a
clear

222
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,839
and then the next so on the right then
we see this cross-correlation function

223
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,329
it has a triangular shape that's because
this this shifting

224
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,899
this happen in as we're betting more
moral I'm there's a

225
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,519
when you're increase in the Sun story
about that so much is the fact that

226
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,230
there's a peak

227
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,260
and it's really obvious at the peak
happens to be

228
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,279
it two seconds or very close to it

229
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,029
which means that we know using a
reference signal

230
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,680
this is two seconds when that sound
occurred

231
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,519
ensured here but he's a reference signal
an exact copy avi

232
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,800
the rectangle wave at time 0

233
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,750
so in the context of a sonar system that
means I miss something and I know it's a

234
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,209
big way

235
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,220
have a copy after all a minute

236
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,320
and so when I'm receiving something back
as I'm receiving it I can

237
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,410
cross corley what's coming in with this
original signal that omitted

238
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,089
we should get a peek if there's a very
good match

239
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,459
the second row has a little bit more
noise no

240
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:05,459
so that the top row as a P Campbell 225

241
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,940
you'll settle rather has begun to 25 the
second row has no reserve one

242
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,430
variance for discussion lawyers is we
might see if you actually had a logical

243
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,519
system

244
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,860
if you look at the wire there's
background noise may be called

245
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,100
a so you can still just been released
see

246
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,730
the rectangle now and if you look on the
right out a curly

247
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,850
see the cross-correlation shows the
result its we see the peak again

248
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,300
however for the last example there's
variants have 10

249
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,850
in the noise which means it's very
difficult as and when you look at the

250
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,220
special you

251
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,449
suspect you cannot see be breaking away
itself

252
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:44,029
you can generally our

253
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,370
but on the right the cut press relations
pretty clear

254
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,670
this is a contrived example user simeon
Gaussian noise which means it's

255
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,899
0 mean is for the should forward to

256
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,019
covered over averaging but

257
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,160
I think the point still stands you can
pull out a similar I would just looks

258
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,719
like background noise

259
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,750
it's important from a sonar viewpoint
because mir's when I'm it's something

260
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,370
its has spread in Los so do you have two
primary sources have lost their spread

261
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,649
in Los which means I missed something at
a point

262
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,940
and it spreads outward so spreading of
us

263
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,420
mister continuation has to do with
absorption up the sound by the air

264
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,889
its frequency-dependent

265
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:31,690
I'm so sonar is not just distance were
also interested in direction

266
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,899
as a human we use

267
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,570
some we we have eight years for it and
we have to them it's not enough to have

268
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,240
two years we also have the structure
around the ears

269
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,320
from that's gotta in a I may be
pronounced incorrectly

270
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,399
but that's the word it just hurts bill

271
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,050
on the side I'm does anyone know what a
head related transfer function as

272
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,839
so altered build some intuition

273
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,480
when you when is a sound says the face
Matt

274
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,329
trade when I do this different points in
space

275
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:09,620
was received you can hear it some record
it that way but

276
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,910
misperceived in my ear drum it changes

277
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,959
actually depending on where it came from
you can measure this precisely and get

278
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,220
what's called a head related transfer
function which is a function essentially

279
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,279
the given some point in space and so

280
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,600
by that I mean there's ASM if in
elevation

281
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,750
giving some point and the sound I know
what looks like when his Mayor Jim

282
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,320
it turns a few minutes for a person and
you can actually

283
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,269
develops after that accounts for in
seeking it surround sound even better

284
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:44,990
I was just to headphones

285
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,300
but you might wonder who missus to say
no why didn't that happened why do we

286
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,060
have surround sound systems whether or
not be market for a chart yes

287
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,540
the answer is it depends on you we age
our TF is

288
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,949
if you've got a piece in the New Year
going to be different for you

289
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:02,820
if you have it will essentially your
shape affects it

290
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,020
here head shoulders so

291
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,709
all those things account for it and you
learn your own nature to your

292
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,289
US the human and animals mammals to

293
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:18,410
to you so that's why there has been such
a big market

294
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,270
it's hard to find it in difficult to
measure

295
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,569
Sears more bouts this is the same that
actually know this is the

296
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,340
a real picture the use of the game begin
the presentation but now you see the bed

297
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,770
is

298
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,679
vocalizing had something the runs its
mouth is open

299
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,210
this is what you would see for the
species if its fine around

300
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,410
actually would see it opening closing
its mouth as it flew

301
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,750
and Mike that great %um you're going to
hear something

302
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,530
been told you we certain points other a
flavor

303
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,080
we'll talk about that in a moment
suspends vocalizing at this thing

304
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,879
discovered in felt like folk everyone
see it on the right side either

305
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,419
slide it was trying to do that for an
experiment

306
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,440
and and so now this is just a for fun

307
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,970
photo added doing it

308
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,410
now it's flying over it it's working
also

309
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,620
their I'll take this moment to say

310
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,160
for those who don't know that's wings
are their hands

311
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,400
in fact corrupt error and my biology is
weak

312
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,789
but I B that means family are that
that's the family or doing this for the

313
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,570
mean swing hand

314
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,250
and in this photo you can see the bats
hand for the feeling

315
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,600
as you can see try to make my arm look
like it

316
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,740
there's oh boo up to the hand you can
see the fam

317
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,000
which you you don't see any photos this
year actually them after the tard

318
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,220
that's used by the bat to grip on things
and it's walking

319
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,750
or doing other tests power and then the
wings of course

320
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,250
are built up by the digits standing out

321
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,490
and so the bed is not going to have sex
with this

322
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,700
it is trying to scoop up bullet was
cheney think it was a target

323
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,100
this bed has a tell membrane can even
see that a member in

324
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,140
is to be more obvious in this photo and
the bottom are

325
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,240
bottom left you can see the bats would
Witcher

326
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,049
the puter surprising small don't have
much function in the species

327
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,200
power and there's a tale there's a their
skin

328
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,480
between miss but catches

329
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,360
an insect it's often the case it's
difficult to catch an insect in its

330
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,370
mouth piece not the source mall

331
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,820
so it catches insects by hitting them
with the wings

332
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,649
or scoop him up with the tail this case
it rains keep up the target which is why

333
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,990
it's making that

334
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,299
motion

335
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,730
son also you beef ideo

336
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,140
experimental context when you want to
study something

337
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,710
you wanted to be controlled you to
control for variation

338
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,130
and for bats we have a room

339
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,230
we as in at the slab in Maryland

340
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,809
where the walls have pat introduce ago
for a standard

341
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,918
issue in for anyone has been accused X
work

342
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,330
we also the video tracking system to
track position on the bed

343
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,158
that is needed no with really high
resolution where the bed is in space

344
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:28,159
that is fine any moment in time

345
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,800
so on the left you should be able to see
you

346
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,810
there you go there's a bat

347
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,990
find your room in fact I'm in the bottom
right

348
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,670
portion thereof video can everyone see
the bat

349
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,570
on the right is the position that's
tracked by the video system

350
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,730
so the great pillars are these
artificial trees we set up

351
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,070
the gnarly trees are just columns have
net the bat

352
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,590
likes to avoid because when it went in
and then gets tangled

353
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,290
are the ways doesn't feel good the
magenta shape

354
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,290
is a net that you cannot see so easily
for a video but its

355
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,320
is put up to prevent that from circling
around the forest the forest but

356
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:25,320
official trees

357
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,240
so we have additional information then
we can ask questions about what's

358
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,100
happening at that point space that is

359
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,020
where the the matter is that is the bat
as its fine

360
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,180
this is a an example vocalization by the
bat

361
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,750
in a good location call we physical
location cause oppose a social call

362
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,090
because it's in a room

363
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,370
but no their bats out

364
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,160
this is the time way form that is
excesses time was on alexis is intensity

365
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,030
measured a microphone on the floor

366
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,230
so when you look at this

367
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,820
you might try to make statements about
the structure it's very difficult to

368
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,659
a crime so here's a spectrogram a dick

369
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,860
and now we can see structure that wasn't
that

370
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,430
does not so obvious again read
corresponds to

371
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,230
greater intensity blues lower and be

372
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,060
y-axis here's different to me so before
P this order sonic range

373
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,810
so the it's difficult to read for your
help

374
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,250
help you be lower one 0

375
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,790
000 is 10 Gillard's in this plot goes up
to about ninety two killer its

376
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,850
and so there's what's called a
fundamental sweep

377
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,350
which is the lower red structure

378
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,470
again wax this is me out for

379
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,630
was all rights this time is about formal
seconds

380
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,440
the call begins at about 68

381
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,730
killer it's been sweeps down to just
below 30 coloreds

382
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,490
that's the fundamental you can also see
what's called a harmonic which is the

383
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,440
structure above it

384
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,580
above the fundamental is that good
everyone

385
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,500
harmonic by definition is a multiple and
frequency of some other signal

386
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,560
so hot harmonica one hundred hertz is to
hundreds

387
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,649
harmonics or make music beautiful for
example well

388
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,300
they contribute to the beauty of music
to everybody's are not so pleasant to

389
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,850
hear

390
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,580
anyway this bed has a sweep it's called
a frequency sweep a richer

391
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,939
however

392
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,670
so we see that but be shaping

393
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,490
love feature the opposition structure
depends on what the bats doing

394
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,930
and so if we're interested in building
little robots that can fly around

395
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,490
and track something we should know what
the batter's

396
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,630
minutes tracking in for checking process
is called an attack sequence

397
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,690
the coccyx actually changes throughout
the sequence in this plot

398
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:00,690
which is taken from a a paper you can
see different call shapes so

399
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,800
has moved from the top to the bottom
we're going to century from search in

400
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,730
the open field

401
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,240
to just before attacked rather just
before capture the numbers on the left a

402
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,760
large numbers are milliseconds its
duration of the call

403
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm left column it's time we form center
column a spectrogram right column is

404
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,960
was called to spectrum magnitude what it
shows energy

405
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,230
across frequency for the whole call have

406
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,910
so to lessen love it if you move down
the middle column you can see that the

407
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,690
the bat begins with not much frequency
modulation

408
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,770
that is the spectrogram ok I don't have
a point or so just

409
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,000
if it's unclear at me and I can making

410
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,680
James the presentation mode in but with
the mouse and but the

411
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,150
in the middle column that I must plot
this fairly flat which means the bed is

412
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,040
not my Julian its frequency that much

413
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,159
and also it's a very low frequency so we
can try to rationalize this

414
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,360
understand it by noting that I didn't
tell you this earlier see what note it

415
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,580
but now we're loading it

416
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,240
atmospheric attenuation depends on
frequency and as you go

417
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,110
up in frequency the attorney tuition
increases which means the 65 kilograms

418
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,930
is going to be

419
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,760
absorbed by the atmosphere a lot more
then 30 coloreds

420
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,260
and so so that's one reason why

421
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,680
we might suspect about has a fairly
constant frequency mission its search

422
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,170
im its longer

423
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,360
in constant which means there's a lot of
energy in a particular frequency

424
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,430
their unit there's is easier to detect
something so if I'm in a room

425
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,800
and have nothing except a small sonar
system

426
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,170
the best way to detect something
detection

427
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,370
as an I want to know if somethings
they're not necessarily where it is

428
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,880
is to send out as much energy as
possible intuitively

429
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,140
and then if there's something there
whatever size it might happen to be all

430
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,650
good

431
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,750
an echo back K

432
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,350
as a move down bacall changes costly
changes

433
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,640
the movie now the middle column we can
see it gets shorter

434
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,910
and their bit begins to be more high
frequency content and the harmonics

435
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,340
begin to appear

436
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,680
there for this is as the bat begins to
find

437
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,350
or is known to target is no tracking it
approaching in

438
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,730
it knows that there is something there
and is very close to it

439
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,600
and so it is trying to do is find out
where it is is trying to improve the

440
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,770
resolution

441
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,460
so-and-so know that would correspond to
increase frequency

442
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,990
so that's why I we begin to see spectral
content up to

443
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:42,990
6700 step

444
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,680
no so interesting question but it

445
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,010
the bed vocal structures very similar

446
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,540
it's not the same is ours in basic
structure

447
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,060
the harmonic I don't know

448
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,610
I'm not sure that is well understood but
if it is

449
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,050
I know which books to looking to trade
answer question

450
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,830
I don't know

451
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,830
because they're they're actually species
about sticking focus Rd focus energy in

452
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,949
different harmonic so it there may be
something more

453
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,080
this species though to my knowledge they
don't have that's

454
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,590
that control

455
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,120
so and then at the end for the bottom

456
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,040
the poses are about 1.1 millisecond mom

457
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,780
so as to say if well do some intuition

458
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,139
a one killer hurts tone has

459
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,430
a period of one millisecond these entire
calls

460
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:43,780
span only 10 second so quickly the best
in reading his calls as a person

461
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,070
something

462
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,129
and as there's more high frequency
content which is further

463
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,940
expanded because the harmonics is also
lower frequency contact

464
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,190
as in there's a sick there's a shift
well-treated give you going to shut my

465
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,190
arm

466
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,970
in this direction and if you stand their
batons catching

467
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,080
an insect you can actually hear a buzz
which has a sound like this

468
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,280
it doesn't go up my went up a bit but
I'm

469
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,500
it's called the terminal bus before
application was discovered

470
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:19,500
that's what scientists were here but
they don't know how to explain it

471
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,080
I well we get to hear recording

472
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,360
this so down by a factor of 10 yeah

473
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,890
look at the record in a bit tumor sites
as the new science

474
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:39,030
we're not gonna talk much about it but
the science the nervous system

475
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,230
that's our mammals which means in many
respects are similar to us

476
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,470
which is why this is an interesting
model well as per the reason why

477
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,930
they're similar but they can fly piccolo
Cape in fact the primary system

478
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,530
is audition that is where as we in
primates

479
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,990
our vision heavy we have lotsa love

480
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,610
lots of parts over nervous system that
have visual responses

481
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:07,820
that's are different and that they have
acoustic sponsors

482
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,210
but some are generally what I come
across

483
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,660
at least insofar as open source hardware

484
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,840
and in the hacker community there's more
to fixation on DG

485
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,590
and non-invasive techniques which is
understandable because in humans you

486
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,110
generally cannot be invasive

487
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,100
for a Korean spy base that I mean
mystical wire and someone said that

488
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,160
invasive

489
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,550
but if I put a pad over the scalp EG

490
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,600
Megu that's not invasive

491
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,580
the problem with these what I call
population recordings is it your picking

492
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,669
up the activity

493
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,140
have an extremely large number of
neurons

494
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,750
and it isn't clear that's the level
which competition happens

495
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,970
in most significant results in
neuroscience happen in animals we

496
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,530
actually doing these invasive accordance

497
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,070
as I know you can actually have invasive
recordings in humans

498
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,480
typically in the context epileptic
epileptic patients who are having

499
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,750
something done anyway

500
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,590
for trying to localize a source what
might be the start of a seizure

501
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,850
in some cases you can get these patients
to agree to have

502
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,790
electrical recordings done way during
the surgery

503
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,940
so there is interestingly that that data

504
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,070
so there's much more the main message of
this is that there's much more than his

505
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,510
population recordings are small the body

506
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,750
you can look at exercise either activity
which means you have a

507
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,410
a wire some others have let Road

508
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,870
in the nervous her in the nerve tissue
in the brain tissue rather

509
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,460
and it's near neurons another spanking

510
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,920
and you can pick up on it how many
people know

511
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,870
what Iran is or at least have had
sketches have explanations

512
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,030
steps get his explanations may be no

513
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,370
with a basic idea I'm in a touch on it
for those who don't know

514
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,480
you nervous system has a lot americans
it also has other things on it

515
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,390
cogwheel cells that support the neurones

516
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,280
and other stuff but neurones 10

517
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,560
we tend to think that neurons are the

518
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,230
the seed of computation if ever gonna
find consciousness or

519
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,510
other magical words like that will be
somewhere in there they run smear

520
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,300
structure

521
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,280
notably organized by a soma abadi

522
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,420
which has the the nucleus classic cell
structure

523
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,240
animal cell structure dendrites so

524
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,550
in the top left to this figure you can
see a lot of

525
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,860
things were going out and as a call the
dendrites

526
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,060
they receive input from other neurons

527
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,860
and again speaking at a high level it
turns out it's very hard to be much more

528
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,950
preciseness

529
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,890
your senses a fairly young field but
there's some kind of innovation

530
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,850
happening as in the new round picks up

531
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,960
this activity from other nuance in this
dendrites

532
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,300
if you look at this figure the summer
has a purplish color

533
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,720
know this isn't me to be biologically
correct is just done the color scheme is

534
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,020
done to be more clear

535
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,760
but as the dendrites you can see these
bluish purple

536
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,670
things those rx on some other neurons

537
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,980
and so this near on has an X on that
comes out

538
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,350
it's covered by that orange material

539
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,130
and what that does is it speeds up
transmission it makes the transmission

540
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,410
mostly electrical

541
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,730
we can talk more about that in a moment
and then this

542
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,550
this axe on goes on a cousin to touch
other neurons and there's things called

543
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,629
sin taxes may be heard about them

544
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,460
when you do drugs typically its an this
site as for activity happens

545
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,500
so there's chemical transmission between

546
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,530
annex on when you're on better than
other and

547
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,550
serotonin selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors

548
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,680
anti-depressants its cuz I've had a
presence

549
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,320
selectively inhibit the uptake of
serotonin knees

550
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,290
set-ups is in the effect is people tend
to be happier

551
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,750
with other side effects and

552
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,220
so it's a scheduling I'm sorry this has
been just a moment on it

553
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,100
to trade to convince you that there's
potential about the richness here

554
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,030
we know there is nice because thats when
you

555
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,770
have a drug when there's something
affecting the nervous system it's

556
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,970
happening at this level

557
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,190
attorney ron noble and so for going to
try to understand the nervous system

558
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:32,500
a biological systems we need to go down
to a fairly basic unit

559
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,210
ever who is it's the near on something
close

560
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,540
you can also do something called
intracellular recordings

561
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,370
that's where you actually have

562
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,830
up a pipette or elected were used to get
on the surface

563
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,370
I've been a run in you pull off some the
membrane

564
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,090
and then you can actually record intra
cell

565
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,720
inside this also its dehumidification to
be you can get extremely

566
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,350
good accordance I'm the goods that
emissions before

567
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,460
in again prisoner at me when things are
clear seem understated

568
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,850
all this integration is happening at the
den trade supposedly is encoded

569
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,679
in spikes so there's some threshold in
with me

570
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,679
potential across the membrane was about
some special dinner on

571
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,070
spikes and many sticking electrode

572
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,899
so if you cut a food fight you it up a
banana in this conference

573
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,839
then came back tomorrow and got the
proof lies you capture record from them

574
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,129
and if you're a coroner activity you
would see spikes

575
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:38,250
after say that's if you stick a lecture
on your honor on

576
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,879
built the strongest much but if it is
the spanking if you interest sailor

577
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,819
recording then you can actually pick up

578
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,070
to me pick up what's called interest
sailor sees me

579
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:52,419
subthreshold activity sub professional
respecting

580
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:56,918
and you can't do any this with with nine
bases imaging techniques so fMRI

581
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,640
just group your outside the brain

582
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,660
you picking up Chris levels of activity
out you talk more about that a French

583
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,560
said during questions

584
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,650
for now so veteran is very small

585
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,700
that's a small the brain's a smaller
ASCO

586
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,030
escobar in this plot is five millimeters

587
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:22,100
we're looking at the top view about
sprain so its mouth would be on the left

588
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,920
side this figure

589
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,210
its but back in body would be to the
right

590
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,340
and I say this just to give you

591
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,070
well we're gonna draw much benefit from
this aside from using ago structure

592
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,530
there's the SCIC those are the superior
quickness near

593
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,140
inferior colliculus as members we have
them to

594
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,339
but in humans we have a huge cortex and

595
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,770
it sits on top above the brainstem
another

596
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,610
brain areas but in bats communion me
there's not as much gore-tex

597
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,920
and the icy and yes you're exposed I
mention those because

598
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,560
they have very interesting behavior for
example you can find me runs

599
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,460
and I see there were what are called
echoed delay tuned

600
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,160
as in if you have a bad never electrode
in its icy

601
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,819
some level any playing to the bat

602
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,600
vocalization appear credible causation
even

603
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,110
where those I should earlier you'll see
some

604
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,310
we once activity actually you might see
activity of certain times before I could

605
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,590
lay tuning

606
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,560
record too late to neurons you won't see
the activity into you have an echo in a

607
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,900
particular delay

608
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,760
in fact these neurons will fire despite
more often depend on the delay

609
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,130
and it's interesting because already we
see some manifestation arrangement

610
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,640
as if you had occurred a population
these neurons that are delayed to echo

611
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,980
to me tuned to echo delay

612
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,520
you could find out or measure which ones
are firing

613
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,130
and get some sense of distance that
clear

614
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:58,550
basic process and you can also find your
arms are selective to azimuth and

615
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,570
elevation that is

616
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,650
direction so many mind the mall you
already have a special view

617
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:10,000
acoustic spatial view

618
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,020
so one on that wicket term keep a

619
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,730
so the that smoke lies in its all time a
formula to the spectrogram

620
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,670
but there isn't enough if you have if I
to speaker for interview

621
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,250
typically you have a piston operation we
could pick it is interesting that

622
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,280
purpose to mean its owner the moves like
this

623
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,790
in news the air in a particular way and
you can model a fairly well

624
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,740
but humans and that's another animals
don't have such a trivial shape

625
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,880
28 and rich sound

626
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,380
which is why may be interesting to study
the sonar beam I see it might

627
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,090
because we don't know and not touch on
some work here

628
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:53,340
but the sonar beam refers to if we took
a picture

629
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,950
so we picked a particular frequency in a
particular time with you get some idea

630
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,440
of shape

631
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,630
with the bed emitted

632
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,440
so previous work now so it's a difficult
problem because better flying

633
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,380
animals if they're not flying or if
there was a cop what's called had fixed

634
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,010
as im the head is fixed in place by some
minutes into the school

635
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:21,980
the best don't want to do anything maybe
it's not surprising

636
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,980
because as we can get to bed not flying
in

637
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,010
vocalizing is work apart from
experiments retrain the bat remain on a

638
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,730
platform

639
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:34,080
and do something book lays out myspace
make a decision

640
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,750
for example that there's a whole
paradigm love these experiments called

641
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,190
to alternative forced choice with the
animal is forced to make a choice force

642
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,570
in a sense that

643
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,770
if you get off the platform than that
that doesn't count as a trial

644
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,940
but a must indicate for example

645
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,100
from this direction the delay was
shorter than this direction

646
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,049
K yeah and so

647
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:02,170
for their work be in shape us the calls
the road here

648
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,230
in the head fixed animal these people

649
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,450
but the scientists whatever

650
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,520
stimulated the brainstem in the bats are
able to elicit vocalizations

651
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,420
from other studies as urs synthetic in
the sense that the bet was in vocalizing

652
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,290
naturally

653
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,529
the closing because someone was putting
currently some profits brainstem

654
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,670
the really know what was going on it
just so happens the opposition's

655
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,280
come out

656
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,640
so later work is with bats that are
freely fine

657
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,960
it's not it doesn't include Admiral work
because it's

658
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,530
curly the electronics don't exist to
record for about that's fine freely

659
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,400
electronics for the neural system
there's some work to do that

660
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,010
but it isn't widespread yet as an is
Justin somewhere but they're not really

661
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,500
saying it

662
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
now with bats to the animal

663
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,760
and so anyway this for their work

664
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,270
so for example in a real talk about a
moment

665
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,670
abuse researcher found out there are two
lobes so

666
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,930
if I put a distance base in a minute on
from it

667
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,480
it has a typical structure have one big
mobile

668
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,990
is what you would see with ultrasonic
range finder for example simple sonar

669
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,880
devices

670
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,470
they had this distance shape you know
the silos but they're small

671
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,550
but this person found for the bat once
vocalizing

672
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,000
it has the forward beam me these are
really gross measurements tourism

673
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,280
much precision in the shape but is a
gross beam

674
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,550
and there's one that comes downward so
from a side view that means

675
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:38,240
when I vocalize out there's a primary
beam there's one below

676
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,330
m downward and so then %um my asked why
it is about have that

677
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,520
in a simple answer is we don't know when
idea might be that the bed can use it

678
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,660
when vocalize is to both book was ahead

679
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,440
for checking insects are targets and it
can use the slower

680
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,700
sound to get more energy to come from
the floor or the

681
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,070
the ground to customs about 22

682
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,940
up and there's other work involving
tracking so

683
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,980
when you have the array setup they will
talk about a moment you can look

684
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,410
where the most energy is directed in the
vocalizations and get a sense of where

685
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,009
the bats looking

686
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,460
again they'll be more clear them on them

687
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,710
and I'll skip the last affects the same

688
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:27,680
go back to it I don't think it's so
clear what I'm saying with our pictures

689
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,190
but the pictures are comes home so maybe
for a raise

690
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,240
you want to measure s a sound

691
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,220
if you have appoint in space that is a
megaphone you're not going to get the

692
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,050
sense of shape

693
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,450
and so there's this thing called a
microphone array which is an array of

694
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,760
microphones

695
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,070
asner sampling the sound field in space

696
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:51,140
have this the previous were to do that
with freely fine bats

697
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,410
was an array that just had a very simple
electronics

698
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,080
basic idea is a bandpass filter Center
235 killer its

699
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,630
it's pretty tight which means you
primarily seen energy at 35

700
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,040
killer its in so in case anyone didn't
know human hearing

701
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:13,040
is up to about 20 kilohertz because now
as you get older

702
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,580
and so with this work but with a better
ray

703
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,900
which is a won the first not the first
after bats

704
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,700
thats how this as researchers showed
that there are these two lobes

705
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,109
and you're able so the tracking no as
you you get

706
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:32,589
we can start to horizontal array so if
if I'm sketching out a room looking down

707
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,509
on it offers on our a means that
megaphones

708
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,960
go around the room and that's fine
around the room

709
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,960
you can see you which direction about
smoke rising

710
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:53,030
I'm gonna skip ahead to see the video
just to keep everyone interested

711
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,969
started over are not

712
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:12,429
between and again so there's a bad move
into this

713
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,999
killed were looking down on terrorism
the largest

714
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:19,999
circles with black dots in the center
are those artificial trees they should

715
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:20,779
do before

716
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:26,469
the magenta lime

717
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:30,099
is that met the prince that from
circling around the forest since we're

718
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:32,849
looking down on it just looks like a
line but again it's a sheet

719
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:36,759
and the blue circles there around the
perimeter

720
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:41,469
are the microphones in history and

721
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:44,499
so the blue trace if you can guess
already is the bats flight path

722
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:49,660
the blue circles with about is at the
moment at this video is shown at a rate

723
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:55,410
it's a factor of 10 lower than what
actually happen good

724
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,169
because time is where them microphone is
on the floor its use as a reference

725
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,669
so the Arabian is or the exe

726
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:06,519
energy near 35 killer hurts your cat
actually a for

727
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,949
shape have a call with time the green

728
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:14,709
microphone the Greenpoint shows our
microphone is that would show you

729
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:19,848
we you can pick up a full band as a
national unity sample call earlier that

730
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:21,039
was a wide been recording

731
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,239
there's no children happen well they're
still trying to present

732
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:28,849
prevent some cod area saying that your
that

733
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:33,940
good

734
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,660
what units time

735
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,430
so one sec in this recording corresponds
to 100 milliseconds

736
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:45,618
it is

737
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:49,490
Visual Sound and so when you so it down
by a factor of 10 than other frequencies

738
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,660
effectively shift down

739
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,049
you see this effect if you play back a
tape at a higher rate

740
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,940
everyone sounds like chipmunks the
playback slower people sound make

741
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:04,940
something deep a big is the room

742
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,640
me it's a good so I can look it up

743
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,020
I'm gonna say on the hors d'oeuvres four
meters

744
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,339
five meters that's a good point we look
at this you don't have a sense of scale

745
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:21,490
the better small so they can carry
electronics earlier

746
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:25,520
financially how much they weigh how big
they are this piece is about 15 grams

747
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,220
typically

748
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,339
grams you question your hand

749
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:35,779
you can do that her but you can hold it
in your hand so when I

750
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,810
in expanding its criminal working and
what about you can pick up the entire

751
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:39,820
bacteria

752
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,849
very easily and thus it's worth noting
is are called big brown bats

753
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:47,869
as make it smaller by contrast their
fruit bats

754
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:51,430
with her big there's one called a flying
fox because it's

755
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:56,640
about as big as a fox butterflies have
been not been on the New England area

756
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,020
are in america I'm so we can get the
precise measures the remainder

757
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:05,599
but for now just about four five meters
its reaction

758
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,109
and so

759
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:12,900
you to these chirps corresponds to some

760
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:19,099
because a shout me ray best

761
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:22,609
it's hard to get to stop on because
Asians here I'm

762
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:26,230
that there's more precisely than this is
a video for show

763
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,980
but we know the precise location times
we know

764
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,630
how much energy is picked up a dish the
microphones that's why we can get this

765
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:38,950
the screen to clear the use of so you
look there you see different

766
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:42,500
levels of darkness the darker it is the
more energy there was no direction

767
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,180
and the result is we can see you where
the best-looking

768
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:53,180
okay

769
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,320
that's a good question

770
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,660
its yeah so this is a initially problem

771
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,670
and going back to season

772
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,280
why did the belt go here easier for sure
this

773
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:22,280
the images of way to the fact that these
two trees

774
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,700
were generally well as a father's path
open question

775
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,150
there's SAT there for two

776
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,330
very briefly is one and there's a whole
group is that is with it

777
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:39,390
it to studying sees me the tracking

778
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,810
I've pray by the bed evasive pray so
there's a question studies in this lab

779
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,340
where those a praying mantis

780
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,650
let loose in the room in the bat would
fly after it and capture it

781
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,280
and it turns out you can model

782
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,730
that pursued behavior for the elegantly
and this

783
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,000
have was just call to pray pursue law

784
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,849
I don't have any sides you don't have to
wait for it

785
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:07,470
we talk about it after the talk but so
in some cases you can mother's behavior

786
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,200
fairly well

787
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,859
by Motherwell I mean you have some
mathematical model what's happening

788
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:16,650
succinct some kind of what's called a
control of something that could be

789
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,890
implemented in a robotic platform for
example

790
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,670
in the military context to the missiles

791
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,930
I'd like to think you can more
efficiently deliver food packets

792
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:30,080
for tracking evasive I'm not sure the
beavis and butt

793
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,848
being

794
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:37,530
so in some ways you can follow the path
and you can explain it well in a sense

795
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,270
that this model this control our

796
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:43,109
yield some have on simulated data the
correlates very well with experimental

797
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,880
data

798
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,190
in this case this is a question I dated
isn't has been analyzed that much

799
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:52,330
but it could be this is one above

800
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,799
the first studies in which the bed

801
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,820
so with this particular set up equipment
with his microphone array

802
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,470
when the first for the bats flying
through force like this and just waiting

803
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,859
to be model but we don't know yet

804
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:07,869
what about you this particular Pat this
is a general problem in robotics never

805
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:09,190
going to an obstacle field

806
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,349
the radio solutions I'm

807
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,980
anyone have that background robotics
navigation

808
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:21,140
so okay I won't go into those but second
time

809
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,339
but ok.so

810
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:27,640
to wrap up it's interesting interesting
question

811
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,540
and that's the nature of this work when
you do you say about article system you

812
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,180
don't know

813
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,589
raid without training on religion

814
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:39,580
it's just the system there that exists
and we're trying to understand it

815
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,750
internet understand if I'm to an
understanding for its own sake but I

816
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,430
also think

817
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,879
you can gain something so the case that
evasive law

818
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,740
papers to law there's no simple control
other commutes to

819
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,859
to manage some kind of aerial vehicle

820
00:49:55,859 --> 00:50:01,830
so

821
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:06,049
disarray was limited and there's been
some work to create what are called

822
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,900
white van a res ones are not limited to

823
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,810
limit is 35 Gillard's for cover very
large ultrasonic band

824
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,700
but they're limited because it's a
difficult problem

825
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:22,700
it's a difficult problem because if you
can record up to 100 killer herds

826
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,790
by the requirements the necklace read
them to be sampling in about 200

827
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,230
at least 200 samples per second per
channel

828
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,450
what's more as if you have ten the
16-bit sample with them in generating a

829
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,810
lot of data very quickly

830
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,950
what's more as it's distributed around
the room

831
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:45,740
a playroom presentable and so

832
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,940
my work was to pick up work

833
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,420
paper stock in the lab to construct such
an array and we've had pretty good

834
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,290
success

835
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:58,420
since there's a much time I want to on
it for long essentially they're a little

836
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,690
microcontrollers

837
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,320
it's a big family the special one called
the DS picked through the efforts called

838
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,280
ESP has

839
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,390
as singers P hardware on board that
means it can be a modification in single

840
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,359
clock cycle

841
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,740
and so on these

842
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,060
me barry powered or powered by a wall
adapter

843
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,190
therefore channels per board Bay

844
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,369
the have s RAM built on so they can
record the high speed required this and

845
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:25,710
what about 260

846
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:30,500
thousand samples per second and the
result was written to it in SD card

847
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:35,310
so this is my attempt to address that
problem

848
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:39,600
web and a rare and we have 28 bill the
system is designed to scale

849
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,260
even more its made in such a way that
you can put these nodes anywhere in the

850
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,760
room

851
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,980
they can receive an external trigger TT
opal's at school

852
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,190
well its is a TD opal's and

853
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:56,490
that allows you to synchronize all them
yeah we're gonna much more depth

854
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,100
but their software associated with that
for analyzing across

855
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,580
array microphones it's not done yet

856
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,880
and fishing up the project and then try
to make it open

857
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,920
access open source freely available if
not an altar sonic work I think this

858
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,530
this work involving a large array
microphones is interesting

859
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,350
some other code could be used are for
the amplifier

860
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:23,799
or electronic design to start open yet

861
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:29,060
it will be soon working on it

862
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:33,070
and so there's no also softer as well
our

863
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:36,250
essentially there's a bat these magenta

864
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,060
beams vectors are skilled according to
intensity in a particular band you can

865
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,630
select

866
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,369
again it's a way better corny which
means you can really focus on parts the

867
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,390
spectrum

868
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:49,230
we get some sort of shape

869
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:54,020
this is an intensity but with respect as
a mechanism elevation

870
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:57,220
are essentially at the center

871
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,960
is where this target is member call to
begin to the Presentation Night

872
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,300
mention those experiment with that was
train to

873
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,500
vocalize their attacker a fake thing
appall

874
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,820
this is that data on the opposing wall
was the rave microphones

875
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,300
in a remake hazard to 16 on the wall

876
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,140
and so here we see the bed is actually
vocalizing of to the site not directly

877
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,279
at the target

878
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,430
again the origin is at the center the
pot no

879
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:30,930
in so we could talk more about that one
theory to explain that

880
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,660
when i buy this is is that when you have
a

881
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,040
a beam have energy if you focus it on
something on a target

882
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,029
is easier to see if it's there recall
that I said the more energy directed at

883
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,800
something the more easily or get a
response back

884
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,089
if you have been corrected of target so

885
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:53,230
here's a target here's the beam axis
being been the most intense direction

886
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,210
if you get this other part of the beam
around the target

887
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:01,920
it's the case that for small changes in
direction spotting is in degree rangel

888
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,650
there's a greater change in intensity if
the returned echo

889
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,339
which means is easier to localize
something by local as I mean if my eyes

890
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:14,980
are closed I'm trying to find out where
I'm snapping

891
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,839
the question is finding that out
localizing the source

892
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,200
so that he would here is simply that the
bat is vocalizing of

893
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,830
away from the target because it has
sharper changes

894
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,850
steeper slope everyone to think a bit of
a bit

895
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,339
of the Nexus so

896
00:54:33,339 --> 00:54:38,020
in Essex summary the end in conclusion
biological systems are rich

897
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:42,890
should consider them in her work the
rich for inspiration for Electronix

898
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:47,290
and I hope you are stepping away with
some interest also in that a colocation

899
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:48,640
nervous system

900
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,690
acoustics but if not certainly in them

901
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,609
the rich potential for ideas from the
world around you

902
00:54:55,609 --> 00:55:02,609
thank you

903
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,950
and I don't think we have much time but
I welcome questions

904
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:13,950
if not just find me anywhere after this

905
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,240
okay

906
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,700
so and I can see because they're bright
lights in my eyes but

907
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:33,740
if you snap now will be assigned 0

908
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,390
workers okay

909
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:44,390
so yes

910
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,620
yes it

911
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,120
her I know is that we mean

912
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,400
yes and so the studies this study them a
friend to hear

913
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,620
the is a non-invasive even get a lot
information

914
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,290
you have a a rich array of microphones
so and repeat the question

915
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:08,600
sorry the question was if this harbors
made

916
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,970
more freely available the hardware
software and so on Nelson stores

917
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:16,230
could that reduce the extent to which
invasive techniques are used the answer

918
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,900
is yes

919
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,990
as non-invasive techniques become richer
simply put

920
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:24,840
there's no need to be invasive their
ethical issues

921
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,080
and its ethical

922
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,279
expense regulatory issues that come up
service or a decade at BNN

923
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,860
they can help in that direction mister
represents about two years at work

924
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,910
and so making it freely available would
certainly

925
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,109
help in a variety of contexts

926
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:49,110
especially animal behavior community I'm
not I'm using

927
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,150
electret microphones as everyone 0
question again

928
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,570
so yes what make friends amazing its
there's a company called knowles

929
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,430
they produce microphones especially
those targeted

930
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:06,740
in implantable in a year there's a time
to make phone call it an electret

931
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:07,450
microphone

932
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,070
if you know what it is essentially one
class a megaphones

933
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:14,470
is 300 as a capacitor

934
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:18,030
so two plates their particular charge on
them

935
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,510
are voted rather okay charge and when
you

936
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:25,430
when is a sound coming the plates move
in accordance with the sound

937
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:29,590
which causes a modulation and voters
signal now let your microphone is one

938
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,770
that has a a charge fixed on it

939
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:36,410
usually when you have this capacitor set
up you actually have to put a very large

940
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,960
voltage across as in about 150 votes

941
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,270
or so yeah so does the workers context
use the small implantable

942
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:48,060
enter here megaphones because it makes
the rave

943
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,240
much smaller so okay

944
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,500
Ivan estimated that more than you might
have wanted

945
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,950
the making sure they said have for Mac
fans coming off

946
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,320
it's actually just a long wire to show
that cable it goes to a pre amplifier

947
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,660
board has a megaphone

948
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:07,259
it's very small you can to stick it on a
wall and going over their techniques for

949
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,630
find a way to make phones are

950
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:13,500
in a room arbitrate placement I'm so
when their small microphones the

951
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,030
they invade the sound field less as a
last note on that was an ass for

952
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:21,230
ben says the presentation ultrasonic
sounds

953
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,430
have because he sounds very directional
you can see this in the human brain

954
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,140
range

955
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,520
for example in cars go by and have
booming subwoofers you can hear that

956
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,200
everywhere

957
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,620
unknowingly maybe when you go to the
higher frequency

958
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:37,240
even in that sound that song the voices
they don't travel around walls they

959
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,530
don't invade your room

960
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,660
so that's in his water sound this
microphone

961
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,940
the stem could block it Buckethead
pretty clear shadow

962
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,660
acoustically so sorry yeah okay

963
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,029
thank you
