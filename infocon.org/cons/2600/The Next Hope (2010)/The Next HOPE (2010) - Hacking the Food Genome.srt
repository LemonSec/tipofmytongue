1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,440
and please it's a freeze country turned
a microphones on

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,410
please its price country hey is strict
here

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,980
who else here is cooked with us ever to
for tacking dinner raise their hands

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,890
anybody all right sir get up here
whoever else is that

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,170
pay 10 get up there we help us pass out
this is so we're gonna do I this is how

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,180
the talks going to go

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,490
red talk a little bit about to good
hockey history a little bit we're gonna

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,580
drop río de

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,020
which is out this food I was or gonna
feed as many people to possibly camping

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,320
trip to food for everybody

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,460
with its everywhere trade for you and
they were gonna demonstrate our software

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,870
platform which is called the

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,760
for genome the Qatar informatics
platform so personal has everybody don't

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,629
you have a good hope

15
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:51,190
careful beautiful so how many people
here see Jason Scott PBS documentary

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,030
right to get laughed at how do you know
that he actually went out for the live

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,480
action character alf

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,870
a very so a the interesting part about
Jason Scott PBS documentary sizzle aside

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,050
about for hacking history

20
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,650
is its toll like a studs terkel its toll
but someone who's part at the scene you

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,070
know

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,470
it's not the one true perspective it's
many people's voices

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,590
and I like that I think Twitter has a
similar quality I think kinda makes me a

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,100
freaks me out a little bit is a you know
hollywood telling the story Packers in

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,430
hollywood saying that you know where you
know we all look like Angelina Jolie or

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,740
Keanu Reeves or whatever

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,610
the kind of had that if what's the
nineties kinda made hacker start to look

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,729
like that and a

29
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:30,799
and I think that's a that's an
interesting thing that cuz we had this

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,150
collective store but we also all have
our own individual stories you know this

31
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,610
is me when I was a kid my

32
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,880
his can you feel like a nerd with

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,479
that network alright a so it's actually
sloppy a discrete way we all have our

34
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,470
own stories

35
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,429
we basically you know a are we can get
coopted by the media would get caught by

36
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,170
Holly we all have our own stories

37
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,680
and so I like to think a bit as a white
hat verses black at how many people here

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,229
identified black cat kate is here is a
hand

39
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,719
yellow bus black to black as the
audience well I submit to you that there

40
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,659
is a things such as white hat food
hackers in my opinion

41
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,849
if they make books for people like a
Riley it's about cooking with Aspergers

42
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,250
and it's all about science and food
things like that you know it's all Alton

43
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,790
Brown

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,760
as little a three-level shout out at the
top suck the shit outta my ass you

45
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,959
twitching narc fuck

46
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,200
so that's pretty good so anyway

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,340
people you know we're as we get coopted
and you know for hacking things like

48
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,160
that so to get caught by the mainstream
to be there trying to tell our stories

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,530
this I'd like to tell our story

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,629
us that's what is but a quick slide is
the true history a black hat for hacking

51
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,899
alright Americans the watermelon girl
pretty happy her article so

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,459
so how is how is for hacking like
regular hacking right will personally I

53
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,180
came up with a hacker see and I started
getting into food and I started making

54
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,090
the food scene

55
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,910
look as much like the hacking teens
possible you know so we have our PBS's

56
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,989
right red kitchen hack lab it's a Bucky
PBS for recipes and menu development

57
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,200
for food packing wiki with the
chronically a baller for hiking tours

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,340
we have %uh some secrets of our
development PBS's and stuff like that so

59
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,590
it's gonna show you just a couple of
flights from it

60
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,970
this but you know we we do our recipe to
a kinda prototyping and software

61
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,290
through these BBS BBS offer though
eventually kinda created

62
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,450
and it really %uh we get out account so
the people that are doing interesting

63
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,220
through things that's kinda that
community you know it is a way BBS

64
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,310
noisily dialing up

65
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,920
but we had this this kind of community
of people that are doing BBS is a

66
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,040
enter interest in sharing their
databases you people at the white

67
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,690
Radware's right we have a

68
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,849
USDA data bases screen three databases
interesting software things like that so

69
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:28,230
that's

70
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,230
that's been one way a we also have a cat
had her kittens right

71
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,060
and so as for hacking for the past five
years will be going on tour

72
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,110
people been building as kitchens are the
one in the upper right is a kitchen

73
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,470
add that was created for us since our
trip croatia by I'm

74
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,799
container this our collective the force
out there and build the kitchen force in

75
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:46,519
the middle of their

76
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,580
art space so we could do the same thing
at sea bass actually doing the CCC

77
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,159
congress

78
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,700
as picture of our mother kitchen there
the unicorn precinct and as we got onto

79
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,790
words um

80
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,810
the kinda a cook with other people in
half for kitchens we can to figure out

81
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,120
what makes a hacker kitchen

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,450
its cookbooks its equipment it's a no
soldering irons to go to fix stuff make

83
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,000
this interesting defer to quit

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,439
and its of this collaborative it this
collaborative experiment

85
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,489
experiment dictate where there are
people coming into this kitchen all the

86
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,830
time the bottom left on his lap 24 /7

87
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,690
in a brick enough that's time a take
some food by the way pass out there is

88
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,529
meat and its

89
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,680
if they were like they were like meat is
a like me I write me

90
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,830
%uh so out so be careful that us so we
have what we had for kitchens have

91
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,199
the trick about food hacker kitchens is
that people have to go there all the

92
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,050
time to eat

93
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,150
and have this constant to creating

94
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,699
process some sort of forgot we have food
acting as a legal right

95
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,290
so black hat hacking sometimes is a
legal and maybe this black cat food hack

96
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,389
and so we have here

97
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,250
a upper left make it any slight bright
enough what you guys think

98
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,370
no can you see anything he turn the
lights down any chance that are a buddy

99
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,259
says

100
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:59,070
anywhere a yeah cuz that's worth know is
what you guys to see this as a

101
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,340
we think that is that better can you see
a

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,280
there we go if beautiful i right so we
have a week without a lot insect this is

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,660
we're out what really been to obvious
that its parts of attacking as you see

104
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,590
this get coopted it's like no TV science
phone so what that is

105
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,080
how do we go in a direction that can be
done on TV that can be done legally we

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,530
can we do dinner parties

107
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,060
our people are all in the kitchen kinda
cooking together you really can't do

108
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,729
that as a as a restaurant or as as a
food card

109
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:27,508
like that we've also got a lotta
drug-related pickings in her coat the

110
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,740
drugs trade ahead anybody are a
beautiful

111
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,419
about this about on upper left is a
different I so has trials where we we

112
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,270
basically soaked like mug Warren were
wouldn't talk to be different

113
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,409
psychoactive a

114
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,220
things in different kinds alcohol and
kinda boil them down into tar hashes and

115
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,620
made a vaporizer course is part of our
meals

116
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,229
a we've also use parts of the body up
for for think this is the totes he's on

117
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,310
the bottom left or if you guys can see
that

118
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,250
the my toe nail got ripped off I drop my
lap he would drop the laptop undertow

119
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,069
before

120
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,840
hurts and %uh so we travel that down
tomato cheese out a bit

121
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,139
a so it kinda flavored the milken you
can make the cheese on the Rhine dove

122
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:04,770
the tow

123
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,979
because the personalized think
favoritism things you can't have in

124
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,150
restaurants right

125
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,030
it's not really kinda drives me a little
bit too is feeding insects the people

126
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,259
feeding interesting things

127
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,199
a so open source is the nuclear option
it may seem like this is a random slide

128
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,060
to put here

129
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,350
what we're working on all the software a
this thing called a few genome has

130
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,199
become very brain ima tell you about

131
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,250
and we've been can try to build this big
open source for taxonomy but now with

132
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,720
all these dot com web 3.0 2.0 companies
are trying to

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,139
you know monetize food month has put on
the Internet Google despite metal web

134
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:35,960
they were here that

135
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,620
freebase a window in a free bases note
so there are other fruit exxon is out

136
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,770
there and freebase was just acquired by
Google which means this huge open

137
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,680
through taxonomy as you know gonna be on
towards certain direction

138
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,569
that's why I'm gonna talk about
switching over to second at our house

139
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,490
open source

140
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,300
is the nuclear option about our software
they've been working on to make

141
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,960
interesting

142
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,430
a I your food applications and Qatar
informatics platforms

143
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,690
we actually is now open source if that
everybody can do that and

144
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,110
it's not just our private little tools
in the lab and I just wanted to a site

145
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,940
visit who voted for ralph nader ever

146
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,699
raise your hand ralph nader some people
ralph nader is seventy-years-old

147
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,880
74 and heat knows nothing about
computers uses a

148
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,550
notebooks and a manila folders talking
about open source he said are you for or

149
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,840
against open source I said what people
seem to coop the open source and use it

150
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,819
to sell things

151
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,880
his idea which owner Peter here now is
it should be regulated by the government

152
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,830
in a way where if you it's like a
organic grape if you go against

153
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,349
open source if you actually don't
release the source code you should be

154
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,630
you know persecuted video prosecutor
basically for false advertising

155
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,120
anyway I think it's interesting idea its
own doesn't know how to use computers

156
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,660
other

157
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,000
so we are gonna open source this open
for taxonomy

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,419
which is the 4G no so now with the part
up %uh talk where men talk about the

159
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,460
food you know

160
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,720
a as they would have the fruit so far
what do you think

161
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,410
as we okay we'll talk about it a little
bit actually before we jump in the food

162
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,099
you know

163
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,750
so our it's a a real expert roll-ups
furrow up

164
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,050
the less is right very easy to make your
own fruit leather so the fruit leather

165
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,849
cannoli

166
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,419
that we made out a roasted pineapple
star knees and we also took some federal

167
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,008
route

168
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,440
and and mix that up with cayenne and
salt pepper it so the fruit leather is

169
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
half pineapple and have spicy fennel

170
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,590
and that's wrapped around the special
sausage and that has a star in these and

171
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,690
other different spices pastry cream in
it so it's similar to a cannoli

172
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,650
it's over the for based around the
outside and water projects we give the

173
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,729
for genome was a the cookbook I can
drive or train read all these cookbooks

174
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:25,599
and cook

175
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,810
havoc for undercut butts in my kitchen
as we're trying to cook through as many

176
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,080
cookbooks as possible

177
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,510
and review them in my past distill that
information feed into this Fujino brain

178
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,468
and %uh so we relied Indonesian
cookbooks in any should have a thing

179
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,390
called some ball

180
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,809
when it had a mixed fruit and chili and
spice yes it's that kind words inspired

181
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,589
so

182
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,550
these %uh food hacking volunteers over
here just getting around applies to make

183
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,019
it for the better

184
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,170
for a hundred the people are gonna talk
a

185
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,349
for their feeding you endeavor with
helping out hopefully so

186
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,060
let's talk about the food you know more
about the food you know is a giant

187
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,320
hungry brain

188
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,420
that straight the internet and learns
about food and a basically quantizers

189
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,810
food has ideas based on the surrealist
food game we bill called the wishes

190
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,510
courts

191
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,350
it was his course is kinda generated I
am

192
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,820
yeah I know thank you I thought its
anyone here like surrealism resents

193
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,200
realism yeah posit

194
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,459
30 said this can be done what we're true
games actually I'm

195
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,640
a Leonora Carrington use the chopper
people's hair the middle the night

196
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,529
at a morning make them breakfast with an
omelet with their own hair in it

197
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,070
it's pretty cute bit of luck
nineteen-thirties that's pretty is

198
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,959
pretty open guard

199
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,149
a few people were doing that back to
date for the reasons but I'm agree to

200
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,209
and stuff but a

201
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,330
so we we took the three list for games
this game called

202
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,839
X was a court three top upwards and you
make sentences out a bit basically never

203
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,070
contributes words

204
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,120
to ever do that with food %uh so you
make up you come up with things like

205
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,390
chicken wing and apple candy delicata
squash in

206
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,360
Jolly Rancher you know but what did
blueberry Bhagat hydrogenated chicken

207
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,550
breast milk it some interesting things
because

208
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,750
it actually I'm get chicken breast milk
that some good

209
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,519
raw chicken breasts weather with milk
positive yeah

210
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,010
yeah but you can still pick me up but
pigeons do even know that

211
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,689
pigeons they do make me look bad as milk
is called crop milk into the back of the

212
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,160
neck

213
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,630
and they feed their young with it it's
kinda gross I am

214
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,950
so I haven't tried it so ok but I

215
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,079
you know someday make it a bit but in no
shape so we we use this the kinda

216
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,079
generate and

217
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,600
the SD about 30 through games that
breaks down your conceptions about

218
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,890
what's possible and it's a reflection of
the collective stomach everyone writes

219
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,019
down to be subdued

220
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:29,700
try this sometime right out these are
put on paper and that ever put together

221
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,579
you take for them at random in that you
make that thing

222
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,480
at Superfund it breaks down your own
boundaries and kinda view encourages

223
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,230
idea

224
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,390
so the other inspiration we have in the
fridge genome is Mayor Gavin Newsom from

225
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,100
San Francisco

226
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,970
anyone alcoholic alcoholic serving
drinks good I had to keep

227
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,529
had a big alcohol scandal and also
Ferran Adria from El Bulli

228
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,140
a had this interesting we're taxonomy of
how he would organize food

229
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,790
and the other is really strange stylized
icons and the upper right corner we have

230
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,510
a sub

231
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,130
had a cookie for bachelors book there
was up in the from the nineteen fifties

232
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,529
were every step didn't really have words
we have one or two words

233
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,529
and they would show you can see here
three cups uva vermouth one cup of

234
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:08,230
cognac

235
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,490
three cups chablis to actually ever shot
so those actually

236
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,440
so is a very visual ideas and so as we
start with the Fuji on the giant you

237
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,690
know

238
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,649
figure how to make a food program that
would generate menus like this

239
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,620
but actually have to be delicious at
least have some sort of a feedback

240
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,190
engine

241
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,000
you go when you could say thumbs up
thumbs down and then the site effective

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,410
that

243
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,990
a was good jump to this one is it would
actually build your flavor profiles the

244
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,930
Fuji no vas engineer you talk to

245
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,200
and tell it what you're eating you have
the food I really tell what you like you

246
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,930
could say gabor York about things

247
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,300
and learns what you like to eat as build
a profile about it

248
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,910
a killer which a kid like to eat you can
say what I like eaten in a in the

249
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,360
your last month or last year things like
that because where we actually have a

250
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,149
an open API where you can very an edge
in and actually do really interesting

251
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,660
kinda geo locative

252
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,160
taste just all things were you see what
is everyone meeting in Chicago

253
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,910
I have a wonderful restaurant cook arm
many books from the past thirty or forty

254
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,010
years from Mike

255
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,189
a San Francisco New Orleans in Chicago
so I think it's really interesting

256
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,240
personally to map up but a special to
those errors and see how the cuisine in

257
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,860
chicago is change the other cuisine in
New Orleans

258
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,010
has changed with them with the oil spill
so I miss get talk a little bit about

259
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,250
the food you know but for right now us
this kind of an example

260
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,010
a was kind of a schematic diagram in
this is like an XML scraped many right

261
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,430
here

262
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,170
we take many years from recipe from
restaurants the paper about the PDF and

263
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,300
Doc formats

264
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,139
me straight but we tokenizer we feed it
into the genome the genome itself is a

265
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:34,139
big database

266
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,220
the knows about all these kinda objects
and things like that it has a scraping

267
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,220
API the feed physics data

268
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,589
nutrition data price data into and also
food modelers that you can build new

269
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:45,769
kinds of food like you can model shit

270
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,269
right you can say the color is brown I
and has a stinky flavor to it and it's

271
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,029
kinda liquid in its kind of solid

272
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,790
at the physics engine on the basis that
knows about things like a liquid and

273
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,469
solid

274
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,519
and you can shop something if it's a if
liquid much you freeze it right that

275
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,310
kinda thing

276
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,000
and so then the API to is available for
applications for recipe tweakers

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,980
a and %uh search engine seized basically
a search through the database and ask

278
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,470
questions you can ask that you know

279
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,170
what read through the China or what
would Julia Child make for me if I was

280
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,850
in Thailand I have a nut allergy NMB can
just is really complicated

281
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,329
kinds of things right and so all these
there's always 3.0 how to customize

282
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,320
through tights coming to

283
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,110
down and I i think thats this is the
secret sauce that a lot of those are

284
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,600
missing I guess because

285
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,510
the way we're able to map this using
Semantic Web technology RTF technology

286
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,889
is a is a narrow enough domain is only
about 60 objects you gotta know about

287
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,740
right like a type a food energy or
region

288
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,810
and a granularity in and out actions and
stuff like that summit i've a little bit

289
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,089
deeper into that but you can see here

290
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,279
we straight this menu this is area

291
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,769
fresh mint sprigs right that's a
cocktail and its three fresh mint sprigs

292
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,649
I got parts to the quantity of three

293
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,100
Sprague's is the unit meant as the
product in fresh is the quality

294
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,290
and all those things mean mean things
and because its traffic web each of

295
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,730
those tokens that its parts now

296
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,639
has a URL which you can look at the
other things and you can say we'll show

297
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,990
me of fresh food

298
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,010
or show me everything has three have
anything or so many think it's measured

299
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,050
in the spring

300
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,110
right so i think thats that's really the
and

301
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,540
of course is regions to know there's
like a in a Cuban cocktails and dishes

302
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,579
and stuff like that so

303
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,839
weird I've loaded into summer the use
cases for the food you know the first

304
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,980
thing we kinda bill was what should I
eat for dinner

305
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,910
right and out with and this is cut at
the beginning of the visualization

306
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,899
because they just sleeping

307
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,480
is that we have the colors that these
foods I think that might even be the

308
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:30,990
next

309
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,769
now qualified down job we actually these
colors that these food service Mitt

310
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,790
pesto pasta for some reason a super
paint why is that

311
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,040
occurs as tomatoes in it this one is up
because the shrimp and tomatoes were

312
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,779
able to kinda

313
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,029
look at food at recipes the glance and
say this doesn't look very healthy cuz

314
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,050
it's very brown

315
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,660
but this is very reading Green that
actually does look for healthier

316
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,779
specially helpful

317
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,040
for when you have your own um bike if
you've met like this is my tire

318
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,430
over a month right and so I had a lot of
vegetables and maybe

319
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,920
you know a lot of meat but the pink
colors and you can look at that at a

320
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,720
glance at it like a mood ring and say

321
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,070
are you eating healthfully or not our
times a 404 has gone so far as this are

322
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,130
you go through a fast I guess

323
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,769
got a lot we've got a lot more %ah the
next for the TOC after have talk about

324
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:15,209
the basics on how the food genome data
scraping works is gonna be the

325
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,560
visualization stuff

326
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,570
that that we've been working on for for
a while that's that's the stuff that's i

327
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,079
think is super impressive

328
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,420
so this is a what rate for dinner where
you just you ask your you ever once this

329
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,149
is a killer app yes the Internet

330
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,620
what what the fuck do I want right I
want tomatoes and most recipe site to be

331
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,399
like your some tomato recipes

332
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,529
but if you have a history could be like
oh we had Chinese food yesterday

333
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,860
good Italian food two days ago so we
want to take you in a totally different

334
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,420
direction

335
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,860
and of course the report thing about
knowing about the yacht is trying to get

336
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,449
you to like foods that you hate

337
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:46,620
right so we know that till it has
mushrooms right so

338
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,639
but we also know that you love choco
tacos but so have you tried choco tacos

339
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,899
with mushrooms in them

340
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,709
South got a growth but say a let's say
you like so you know Hawaiian food body

341
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,170
hates our bring paper

342
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,829
was he tried Hawaiian skewers with pork
and pineapple green paper on it's a way

343
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:02,440
to get

344
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,430
into are you know to try it out you know
had this little step that helps you like

345
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,680
the food that you fucking hate

346
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,579
rate and I think it's especially good
for fun for kids and stuff I who have

347
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:11,389
kids

348
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,410
anybody kids are a good ever have kids
that is great

349
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,149
a so that we have a allergies as well
you gotta win learning what you like for

350
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,000
what you don't like

351
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,589
but also what you're allergic to you can
say I don't care program paper so much

352
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:29,310
but peanuts were killed me because we
had this with a

353
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:36,310
up

354
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,709
South they leave empty plate at the end
for betty has to say

355
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,750
give it up for the death vessel lays
down a min i right path

356
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,449
food out beautiful a that festival

357
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:54,860
de festival also knows how to know that
a cleaver

358
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,160
alright a that's scary okay so I am so
we talk about allergies were bad because

359
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,160
web international database right the
knows about the test results around the

360
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,449
world have big lake which look up table
and stuff like that

361
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:07,059
this is that this is an app that our
friend marked up for the iPhone which is

362
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,168
peanuts will kill me

363
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,890
which is whatever country you're in
right you want the language to say

364
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,980
peanuts will kill me in whatever
language you know in the country as you

365
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,709
don't have to

366
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,919
they want to go to another country
explain how big you are great and you go

367
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,760
to germany and they're like I

368
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,490
so a or Mexico as another example

369
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,400
alright so up as we as well as we
started I'm you're scraping Office beta

370
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,020
I would be three straight hundreds
thousands recipes of the internet and

371
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,639
started modeling them looking for
similar things

372
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,970
that were among them and so that we
started talking about how to organize

373
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,270
the fruits there's this whole

374
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,700
periodic table of contents ideas for how
do you how what are all the different

375
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,740
ways that you can group different kinds
of foods

376
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,380
on so here's how we actually get
straight this recipe let's go through

377
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,679
the thing really quick so

378
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,770
um so these pills are here are the
recipes tagged agree its interactions

379
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,340
that's basically every recipe has that
arm and you can

380
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,520
you write a personalized scraper for
each recipe website that you're at a

381
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,480
hundred thousand recipes are from thirty
forty thousand per website usually for

382
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,320
the big ones

383
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,860
as he read the recipe you know about the
ingredients in the directions in the

384
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,559
tags

385
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,168
and were actually able to scrape them
using these components buckets and

386
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,309
statements

387
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,620
into making this is a our first recipe
Tweaker prototype we made with his

388
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,880
French onion soup

389
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,640
and you see the detective it was well
knew that was France and it was again

390
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,289
that was a super

391
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:19,669
on it was the main ingredient French was
the region pretty quick on France

392
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:23,419
a which doesn't work anymore force our
software a change to Morocco changed

393
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:24,880
from a rockin onion soup

394
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,630
and I would figure out which these
ingredients is French and replace them

395
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,220
with Moroccan so at like you men in
orange zest

396
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,240
right rejected from French to Italian on
its super rad you know hella herbs and

397
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,690
you know

398
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,919
whatever a remark or something like that
I i get if you could count on you change

399
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,240
the butternut squash

400
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,070
I J making butternut squash soup with
immigrants were taken from soup to a

401
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,360
souffle that would change

402
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,850
had using the same ingredients I be able
to use these private visit the

403
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,940
specialized processes brought change to
make that different thing

404
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,520
for the way we were able to do that in
this prototype level with by scraping

405
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,049
these ingredients and directions

406
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:58,230
into buckets and having statements in a
bucket and statements basically work

407
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,850
like

408
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,620
you know you chop garlic and you put it
in a in a pan right up and becomes the

409
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,660
default bucket

410
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,360
and then you had wine and then the
statement your parsing the recipe just

411
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,730
the pros at the recipe

412
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,660
and you know that you're adding one to
the default bucket that was last defines

413
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,080
it as a No in that field

414
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,178
and then you would say I hate mail and
combine the two

415
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:19,900
and so had no which are those for
buckets what equipment is being used

416
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,390
which each step which products are being
used in each step into this as kind as

417
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,210
an example

418
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,549
%uh how that pipeline works and were
able to kind of super

419
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,070
group the recipes and components like a
rope upon sister porn

420
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,939
like Weber said right here bakes your
make a cake right are at muffins and one

421
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,720
muffin with

422
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,530
come up in 31 a tibet so you have the
wet and the dry components and so

423
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,460
our algorithm is able to detect up well
this is the vegetables

424
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,960
and these are the herds this is the wet
stuff these are all used in this step

425
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,020
this is the frosting for a cake

426
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,580
basically so I'm they also think we're
able to parse is a

427
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,168
geographic content and so we basically
built a GOP our geo taxonomy up food

428
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:00,000
right so it's not all countries in Asia

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,850
it's just all the countries in Asia that
have distinct cuisines I'm sure we're

430
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,020
totally funny people

431
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,559
I think that's another idea wanna talk
about actually is according to

432
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,100
Indian food this is a good pairing
according to Indonesian food this is a

433
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,789
good pairing

434
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,559
but it's all according to the Fujino or
according to this cookbook there's the

435
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,100
idea in Semantic Web

436
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,549
is that your contacts the Semantic Web
statement is a subject predicate

437
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,639
object right seats a tomato is a key
ingredient

438
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,210
Italian food and the context is
according to

439
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,870
Mario Batali right or according to or
maybe it's a canonical statement

440
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,919
it's all the statements in the Fuji no
are your canonical if they're real

441
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,789
things like

442
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:38,908
celery seed Israel is a part but the
plant up celery root

443
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:42,230
and celery seeds apart the plaintive
celery those really and canonical fact

444
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,890
statements

445
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,669
but there's also contact statements were
you say according to persons that live

446
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:47,870
in Los Angeles

447
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,240
right race is a Persian food buck or two
per Twitter audience that live in Iran

448
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,320
you know that's a tehrani food because
that's where the rices bread is

449
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,530
everywhere else in the country its
affiliates able to see from these

450
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,129
different kinds of perspectives

451
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,970
and that the whole point of this is to
yeah there's a tokenizer 3 a recipe here

452
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,400
for

453
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Jamie Oliver's minestrone soup right
soviet sparse down this display in a

454
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,289
large stockpot

455
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:12,110
over medium-low its personal the buckets
knows that there's a large stockpot

456
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,150
knows all the ingredients in a step it
does the actions its figured out that

457
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,090
your sauteing you're chopping

458
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,480
those kinds of things that also a is
able

459
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,450
what I think that I think I mention was
the slider technique which is I don't

460
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,210
think in this thing we're able to kind
of have a slider on a recipe a tweaker

461
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:26,870
recipe

462
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,580
and say make a vegetarian or make it be
getting or speeded-up

463
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,220
right I don't wanna have to make roast
garlic all this but the chopped garlic

464
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,130
enright

465
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,230
this is the way it's like a tweaker
recipe and make it cost less

466
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,390
a just those are different parameters a
triple to tweak it once you kinda

467
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,880
quantizers recipe

468
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,299
author here's kinda hard tokenizer works
a little bit so we have things like

469
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,450
no 2 tablespoons minced garlic in it
said that the quantity unit a

470
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,990
preparation it detects a

471
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,130
articles like or non-alcoholic as a
quality

472
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,480
on refined as a quality preparation
slice

473
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
so basically parse through to these
lines try and find

474
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,260
unit or quantity first and if there is
no you to require your thoughts each

475
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,440
you have a recipe that calls for orange
right

476
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,400
what that means so we have this physics
engine on the back and I'll see when the

477
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,140
next slide

478
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,650
that knows what if you just addressed
because says orange kinda knows what the

479
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,600
proportion of the recipe that is

480
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,200
and that identifies the other types of
tokens interprets grammar stop words

481
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,549
it has to resolve type conflicts what
clothes have garlic

482
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:27,220
like to close a garlic is that close the
food were that close the unit

483
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,789
right on has a gone beautiful

484
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:35,020
alright nice job for which the effort
where'd putting the encouragement

485
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,129
thank you %ah so

486
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,039
we have a this is a for the physics
engine on the back we basically straight

487
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,510
this thing called the book revealed its
kinda it's kinda miss

488
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,379
arm a common book reviews and commercial
kitchens where it says a head of cabbage

489
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,429
yields this many cups of chopped cabbage
right if we had this year but you're

490
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,020
able to convert between the units

491
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,668
amassed as purchased in volume right so
the engine that we have this live API

492
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,030
is able to say one cup a battle weighs
13 ounces

493
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,629
writer 10 million ways out at me out one
part of cardamom this point 37 grams

494
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,190
and that's an important to them this
every recipe website or conversion or

495
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,289
even USD website

496
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,140
has this out for them and look up table
with all that special cases were kinda

497
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,530
making this public for the people

498
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,340
are able to convert these things if they
want as purchases a unit that some

499
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,500
used in restaurants a lot like a case a
banana its right

500
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,110
or clove garlic it's something that's
neither mass nor volume but has a

501
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,730
massive has a volume

502
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,080
I'm that kind of interesting oh yeah
this is also because the support a

503
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,289
graphics I take full responsibility all
the beautiful graphics Bioware done by

504
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,299
Jules because after my hand

505
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,039
yours right there forgiven for being
here with me so the beautiful graphics

506
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,230
here's the city graphics that I made
this is a meeting this is me charting

507
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,260
the lifeline of how dead a piece of
fruit is our peace the food is that I'm

508
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,070
eating right

509
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,870
so the top one is salad dressing the
salad dressing when you create it is

510
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,950
this point right here

511
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,250
are the black pepper is alive for a
while and then dead boss dried mustard

512
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,620
same thing onion powder is alive until
it's dry treats you well as hard stand

513
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,779
ride X hours are alive and dead

514
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,750
and they're all dead when you mix them
together and make salad dressing and it

515
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,590
sits on a shelf for ever need it

516
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,500
compare that to sourdough right where
you have a starter which is alive

517
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,650
partners green-line mean

518
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,750
the live so why have parted the food
that you mix and the week with a live

519
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,330
for a while the shirt was alive for a
while but the thing that you're eating

520
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,658
is that the democrats thing for a while
in the cooking process actually concerns

521
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,140
that

522
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,190
compare that to me so simply makes me so
soon everybody admits no

523
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,760
alright army so was alive when you hit
because you're not with the boil it

524
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,279
right to me so it was living

525
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,640
you know culture that that grows on so
it means a democrat the starches

526
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,419
the green onions rely for a while but
you know flakes and seaweed archive good

527
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:37,120
for you

528
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,539
because they've been dead for a long
time but the drive a lot of Japanese

529
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,120
cuisine is a lot of dried food because
the seasons there in

530
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,820
your harsh winters and so we make miso
soup you mixing is dead things in this

531
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,450
life thing but actually live in a but
since you have so

532
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:52,070
are a few eat like who here likes turkey
turkey delicious turkey

533
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,428
every turkey go to sleep right you might
happen to the day well

534
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:58,860
I was for the only its you know why food
during the day like salads and stuff

535
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,440
like that and those are enzymes are
putting into your body so that you have

536
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,860
the energy for the rest of the day

537
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,730
if you're eating that food in the
beginning part the day your body has did

538
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,750
exert energy to generate those

539
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,169
to break down are two different times to
break down all that stuff

540
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:14,260
and so a I think it's interesting to to

541
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,400
kinda pointless how alive the food is
that you're gonna put your body

542
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,940
oh yeah this is cam a description of
what it said awesome

543
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,470
who hears vegetarian RS but the
vegetarian ones out there

544
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,720
beautiful

545
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,520
yes some budgetary come up and pass out
to the jury that she knew the secret

546
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,279
handshake great

547
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,610
series resisted yet the it's a right
angle with a carrot

548
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,100
a case of its us to talk about what I
think whoever sentence diagramming in

549
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,730
high school

550
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,179
urging her eyes you're hired a right
said if their Grammy through the same

551
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,460
thing with food where you take it to the
scraper read this recipe for vegetable

552
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,190
stock

553
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,650
and it's able to I talked earlier about
components right well the components a

554
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,380
vegetable stock is you roast the savory
vegetables

555
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,679
and you at this into a stock pot and so
we kinda be about this

556
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,730
this a recipe diagram generator where
you would have all the savory vegetables

557
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,450
right here

558
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,429
the action was roasting at miss the
preposition really the 45 minutes time

559
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,419
and these are all the herbs that are
getting added into the stock pot after

560
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:11,789
the vegetables get roasted

561
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:15,169
this is the white wine that's getting
added to this equipment and the glazed

562
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:18,929
and all that added to the stock later
because it's like the flavors the fund

563
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:21,700
and you have a stockpot here that's got
water being added to and you're

564
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,980
simmering it for an hour

565
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,809
your straining after cheesecloth what
this allows you to do it allows you to

566
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,480
replace different parts of it

567
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,740
they say well actually want but some
family my product are

568
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,840
but some beats or whatever we like okay
well that's part the roast vegetable

569
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,970
party goes in here

570
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,590
or use a look at some basil okay what
goes into the curb component list right

571
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:38,929
here

572
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,870
we say why don't have a cheesecloth a
kind of downgrades using our taxonomy to

573
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,539
to you know pantyhose urs trainer
something like that

574
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:50,179
this is kind of a larger one called
rhubarb syrup weird I think he's chunks

575
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:53,950
and won the position that's interesting
here is fixer up consistency

576
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,799
writer boiling this down for this amount
of time worth fixer consistency

577
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,240
and removing from heat and adding lemon
and what levin's two years adding assets

578
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,820
of course we don't have them in you out
a little bit about the cider vinegar and

579
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,710
things like that

580
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,480
so kinda visualize the for this way
helps you think about what replacements

581
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,000
to do

582
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,490
and also kinda how what all the buckets
are I for the stuff now we'll talk a

583
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,460
little bit of the colors the food
services

584
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,830
early part the genome graphics um that
would have started measuring water all

585
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,990
the colors above food that we have right

586
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,510
here you have like I need to to an apple
and banana and and not and beats and

587
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,629
beans and stuff like that

588
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,049
um and here's kind have idea this is
chris is true that he's been eating it's

589
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,250
all gravy because he's only filled up
his personal for genome a little bit

590
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,080
but this is your premier mushrooms are
we think it's important to look at the

591
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,480
color the food that you meeting

592
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,630
before you did not after you read it
mindful red-brown

593
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,590
you know what I mean and to basically be
able to look at all these people through

594
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,610
genomes and say

595
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,279
this person's not very healthy because
they have some tomatoes and things but

596
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,520
the radio on a white food or water brown
for a lot together for like oils and

597
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,899
stuff like that so the color

598
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:53,230
is important to part especially with
kids like how to think about on how to

599
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,169
think about food

600
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:57,399
now we go into the trippy food Mundial
earth

601
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,750
but I think that Cena but a hand for
Jules the trippy food Mon dollars

602
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,830
alright so the trip you should not
dollars this is the history of food and

603
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,158
the middle column is kinda if this is
the doctor seuss truffle a tree she

604
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:10,110
right here

605
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,210
it's a it's how divers are cuisine it is
but the cuisine that you eat

606
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,919
its are able to map are different corpus
is now which is the food industry please

607
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,580
don't know about the context we know

608
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,870
miss the corpus from all recipes dot com
website the corpus from this cookbook

609
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,940
the corpus from out this person's
twitter feed we're able to kinda

610
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,330
visualize those to be able to say things
like well recipe so this is a recipe

611
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,240
source:

612
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,850
for all the anti pasta recipes all
recipes dot com a lot of have red bell

613
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,669
pepper and ice but I think as a further

614
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:40,120
filter on this and this is all the sub
anti POSCO it's right

615
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,049
for this went down here all you know
very green peas was a pretty brown

616
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:46,070
because I have a lot of dough in it for
any pasta dough and this was a very

617
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,270
cheese heavy cuz it got

618
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,020
orange right these ones they look pretty
see can see just by looking at all these

619
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,270
how diverse each of these recipes are
these visualizations a recipes

620
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,100
by the color how healthy they are how
diverse they are and how about how what

621
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,200
the proportions are about the food

622
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,620
that's kinda cool huh vocal percentages
or whatever this is actually for regions

623
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,510
a position so

624
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,640
given a corpus of recipes these are
Chinese recipes

625
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,250
these are Japanese recipes either Indian
recipes are Korean recipes

626
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,529
you have like a lion in milk and rice
and shit in the Indian food

627
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:17,559
versus %uh Singapore and Thailand sir
able to come look at these

628
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:21,168
cuisine types by region and say well
this is different in this cuisine to

629
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,679
maybe this is a little more diverse

630
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,880
like Singapore I mean also kinda
reflective of how she a recipe sources

631
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,399
that the Singapore recipes

632
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,470
arnett are more diverse the Japanese
food could support for is actually

633
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:31,960
pretty diverse

634
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,149
so are so that since they were able to
use these put mine dollars to look at

635
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,309
recipes regions

636
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:41,129
and compare your diet overtime right so
this is you know day 1 day 2 day 3 day

637
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,950
forty five to six and it kinda you know
gets these

638
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,679
extra little layers here about this
column: rising up

639
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,240
and because it by quantity because by
percentage amass

640
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,490
it's interesting because a lot of the
stuff that builds up in the tape is like

641
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,909
herbs and spices and things like that
all right we still have

642
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:01,190
a beautiful play a time it's almost 420
everybody

643
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,029
the C you know are the as a measure my
food over time so

644
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,580
that we paid my friend Chloe it was an
amazing and male artist

645
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,720
should even just like look at her
website right our website for genome dot

646
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,370
com

647
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,750
as she does drew every food right sure I
like five hundred of the main foods

648
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,000
a we're on the web rape maybe a lot
people begin our website right now so

649
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,600
she

650
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,470
drew all the food groups and they're all
cute and smiley and Anna Mae and stuff

651
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,340
like that I know it's super adorable

652
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,860
and so we started using this platform a
buffer genome to make

653
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,799
you know it's all well and good to make
interesting kinda chef tools up to this

654
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,270
point when we pass a

655
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,668
here's all the food bet that we have in
the kitchen which we make and and kinda

656
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:41,570
understanding

657
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,200
the exit extend the food aid out there
but how big are appealing to people

658
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,190
so we start putting them out building
little food games right by buildings all

659
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,960
cards

660
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,620
and kinda like that which is court stuff
earlier we're kinda getting an idea

661
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,789
what to cook you're actually you know
building these things together and

662
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,070
charting you know if these are

663
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,269
you know we had refrigerator magnet back
things on somebody's like on the fridge

664
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:01,809
and so does the match in with your kids
you have

665
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:06,830
every food together sugar and they have
that skill and MA faces and stuff on him

666
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,129
you know it's kinda putting them on the
fridge and think this is the food that I

667
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,429
want to be sleeping on the play with
your food

668
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:14,490
and to treat pets buddhism

669
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,100
for someone to cook it takes a big
commitment and there's games out there

670
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,419
like these restaurant to a virtual
restaurant games in Farmville or cafe

671
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,399
lander whatever

672
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,669
those are kind of interesting but they
don't actually you know translate into

673
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,070
maybe they do trends in a real-life able
to play them very much but I think I

674
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,240
the challenger with the Fujino is use
that as a platform

675
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,809
are two bilbies for games on it that
actually do affect how people see food

676
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,710
and given different ideas for things

677
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,690
like if you ever play Scrabble you a bag
of chips news reach in and grab some

678
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,620
letters and build 30 words and stuff
like that a refrigerator magnets

679
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,620
you do the same thing with food we
describe a few things you say 0 lettuce

680
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,590
and balsamic vinegar

681
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,649
that sounds good what else goes okay not
this not this not this

682
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:53,970
at the white easier then going to a
market for some people because of people

683
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:54,940
don't have markets

684
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,630
I'm to go around to so whoever Shanghai
Rolex saying hi right beautiful so

685
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,970
we we start looking at you know how to
build food games the kinda

686
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,519
um you instill in some when this idea

687
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:09,760
but you can play with your food that you
should break down your barriers up what

688
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,090
you expected so we take these

689
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,279
no tiles from preaching hi and start
looking at pattern matching

690
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,000
you noticed them just among and you say
well these are you know when someone

691
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,080
playing the switching high game they're
looking at

692
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,908
a lot of it looks like a lot a visual
noise but there are these patterns that

693
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,580
are detecting the patterns are

694
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,799
things like count and color and %uh
shape of things right with one out what

695
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,830
a long stocky things around things in
different you know

696
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,029
amounts of things purses you know three
year but many in

697
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:36,620
different kinds of colors are these
foods and because its games from the

698
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,630
Super Nintendo

699
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,730
and they don't really have a lot of you
a very good color palette and so

700
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,090
a you know we have we have a richer
color palette we got a lot of ideas for

701
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,230
just when people would use food for art
for games for back in the day

702
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,630
and so we started building with pacino
things like food Tetris

703
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,779
things like food minesweeper things like
food I'm risky buster chaos who he

704
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,549
remembers risky buser chaos but an RCA
anybody and rescue personality

705
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:02,590
is this week you don't know jack and we
built this

706
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,769
jobs but this chat bot right to have a
new game it would say

707
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:09,159
a became the current game is tomato and
basil you're all logged in

708
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:12,990
what is your good idea with tomato and
basil and the message the bottom you say

709
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,940
why would make a tomato basil

710
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,289
milkshake and someone out there can I
would make a tomato basil casserole

711
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:21,140
and I would post the result in people
would vote on these things and that

712
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,960
kinda mechanical turkey if you will

713
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,070
this head-to-head multiplayer uproot
which came

714
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,620
that helps you kinda have %ah cuz that's
that's really

715
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,260
that the key about having an algorithm
Mike the food you know his need human

716
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,700
input needs people to go and say this is
gross

717
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,090
this is good this is gross this is good
or this is gross to europeans misses the

718
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,350
richest Americans

719
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,399
right and so we're trying to build beast
which games

720
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:46,850
that are these ideas on how to how to
take its

721
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,279
fire hose a through data that's coming
in on the existing for genome website

722
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,149
and Twitter by

723
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:54,120
we're messaging the tweet about what
you're eating a building a food diary or

724
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,470
yours going to teaching I like this I
don't like this

725
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,320
and trying to make sense a bad it really
simple kinda like Tetris eat which game

726
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,529
kinda idea

727
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:05,350
I'm so here's yet we can meet that's
pretty good so I i send for genome

728
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,399
others Twitter bot you know what I've
been eating but I A

729
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,319
Indonesian pineapple sausage fennel and
garlic that's in the stuff today

730
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,550
and food you know kinda writes back it
helps me give me a bit we address our

731
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,790
nominee address

732
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,500
a tiny URL to that job to that URL right

733
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,719
but that kinda is building the genome
this concept if these are the game

734
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,540
blocks

735
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,149
that can be used in other kind of game
so we have to look at that and say

736
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,020
that's disgusting maybe is a Canadian
chat room that just says that does not

737
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,320
sound Canadian this is the 100 percent
official

738
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,760
you know Canadian stamp of approval or
whatever I we also built this iPhone app

739
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,079
for doing like a recipe ideas on ago we
loaded a corpus about 60,000 recipes on

740
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:41,980
an iPhone app

741
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,310
it said hey I've got blueberries because
the Bluebirds oh honey dew okay here's

742
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,810
ideas for honey do a blueberry

743
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,839
right and also has regions in it as well
see could say

744
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,960
I want what I do with blueberries its
French is really simple

745
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,668
pens ideas these are just kind of after
we finish this up kinda

746
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:59,900
the back end up switching off after we
started building is absent games on top

747
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,020
a bit trying to figure out

748
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,950
what we wanted to play around with food
um wealth we got okay here comes the

749
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,240
core visualization shit

750
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,710
for this is the corpus %uh mango this is
like a 199 mango pairings that are all

751
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:17,680
have compared across these these axes
know what the axes mean

752
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,569
raises that the airport a he says the
higher up these pairings are the better

753
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,690
the case with mango so lime juice and
salt air up here

754
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,290
but like broccoli and apple juice and
tuner kind of down here so these are all

755
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,490
things that go with mango maybe maybe
not

756
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,790
and this a is two axes were you have the
y-axis is mango

757
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,160
and then the right the X accesses prude
salad and it says

758
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,589
if mangoes and a fruit salad it goes
really well with apple and lemon

759
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:41,810
marshmallow

760
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,509
but does not go very well with paprika
in Hammond ground nutmeg but those are

761
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,410
still things

762
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,040
that go well with mango because they're
up here whereas they don't go well for

763
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,119
its alec is on the side the axis

764
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,640
so these are just like the preliminary
kinda applauding stuff we worked on

765
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,440
and then we started moving into this
crazy shit you ready for this the food

766
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,650
star charts

767
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,070
they believe in think there's a monkey
view here's a monkey view

768
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,990
a so social started making his food star
charts right this an interesting one

769
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,470
this is time versus time is everything
biko's

770
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,890
with time I'll African you the whole
thing on the screen

771
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,690
so these are things that don't go with
time at all and these are things that do

772
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,510
go with time

773
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,790
and their in them it's like a corpus of
food recipes is built is

774
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,859
fed into this it says according to this
court is a forty thousand recipes from

775
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:25,098
whatever website

776
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,349
these are the foods that are mostly with
you know it

777
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:31,520
aggregate all the mass that that they
were in the recipes with time right

778
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,770
and so these ones what would someone
beef broth mushrooms

779
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,940
chardonnay okra all those things go
really heavily with time

780
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,780
and so schedule back to this and say
missus assault this is going to cause us

781
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,829
all persons through the goes a sugar
right

782
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:47,859
you get is really beautiful kinda trippy
images were you saying

783
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:51,990
you know sugar has a lot more this big
for cluster down here in a savory costra

784
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,510
up here

785
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,260
whereas all the stuff that goes with
salt is you know doesn't have those

786
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,930
clusters

787
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,598
and I really recommend the checkout
kinda our website monkey view for some

788
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,339
%uh visa

789
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:04,770
for some of these images because there
there's fucking gorgeous

790
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,630
where the just different reappearance
and you can't assume way any kind

791
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,390
exploring kinda like star charts

792
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,328
and we have an open API for
visualization where you can grab the 0

793
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:14,260
dis requesting

794
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,109
what goes with this wait them and what
are the colors are these food

795
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:20,380
and treat the thing that we've really
learned from doing this is that all

796
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,510
foods go together

797
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,630
like seriously offer its fucking go
together you just have to find something

798
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,240
else

799
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,010
to make it in you know you could say you
could say chocolate doesn't go with

800
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,599
squid

801
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,210
right but it does if you mix milk and
final with a red verging

802
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,349
yeah no you were into that you promise
quit once i woke me up in the morning

803
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:39,089
for a three foot square next to my head

804
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:43,210
and said make this a referendum to make
a chocolate for me the stock persuaded

805
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,540
and I thought it was pretty good because
growth a so this is kinda for

806
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,050
visualization again if he's my soul and
my sprites and and try to figure out

807
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,839
you know which foods kinda go together
so we have you know

808
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,140
but would go together according to me
according to my kid according to

809
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,529
the country France according to the
country france in the eighteen hundreds

810
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,130
we have all these different context and
recipe sources that allow you to kind of

811
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,180
figure out what's your angle is and you
can say chop it doesn't go to with

812
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,848
square except for this one really weird
about British recipe from the 1500 or

813
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:11,490
something like that

814
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,250
which is before the chocolate which is
trippy pirate

815
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,369
so that was very also using its API to
build on well

816
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,550
jewels and Annalise made these a these
are

817
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,920
placemats and this is United States
cuisine

818
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,349
in the background rate which is all
burgers and fries and shit with burgers

819
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,619
and fries on it

820
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:33,490
right this is a belief French food rate
with a croque with a I'm with and stuff

821
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,990
up the Spanish food actually

822
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,630
would like red pepper and so this is
also place but these are available on

823
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,180
Etsy dot com a thinker because the tote
bags are

824
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,879
I'm with choco tacos we haven't actually
added that the genome yet sorry you

825
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,760
could be the first

826
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,329
be the mayor choco tacos Sorry Sorry
able to kinda

827
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,810
a bring the genome into the offline
world where we are creating are

828
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,200
out of these things and making huge
posters that do the star charts

829
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,859
and are actually you know building you
have food you're eating of your own diet

830
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,490
you're looking at this and you say well
this is Britt this is American cuisine

831
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,310
ID'd American cuisine is messes with
your head

832
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,589
you look at you're like man has a lot of
great is what a mayonnaise in the corner

833
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,720
right over here providing no milk in
brown stuff and so and what not

834
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,810
about this is beautiful well unicorn
break thick

835
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:19,060
so are we would have her house computer
precinct 13 would be doing is dinner

836
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,349
parties for the past five

837
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:23,359
path for 2004-2005

838
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,529
a where 535 people come over at Hooters
couple hours before

839
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,250
10 where you at though in a row and yeah
are a beautiful so people are come over

840
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,599
bring in groceries

841
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,680
our chip in for groceries and we all
cook together have all the crazy science

842
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,419
equipment cuz I

843
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,810
I worked at the Fat Duck and and trained
molecular gastronomy their serb liquid

844
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,828
nitrogen in the

845
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:43,849
vacuum pumps all that shit and
accountable for all that stuff but it's

846
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,070
just fun for people to come over and
kinda play with that

847
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,099
and so at the airport present we have is
their parts will come over we are kinda

848
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:49,910
cook together

849
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,410
and it's different than work in a
restaurant arts everything going to

850
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,348
underground

851
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,030
cafe because we have a therapist
sensibility if there's the head chef

852
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,040
who isn't gonna fire you and you're not
trying to execute their vision.

853
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,190
it's like an anarchist pirate ship it's
like follow me to certain plunder

854
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,339
what you wanna make oh you're the okay
congratulations to the pirate captain

855
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,540
now you should take over

856
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,480
like him should make some %uh pork pork
loin stuffed has brought the pork loin

857
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,500
what you want to do with it

858
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,560
as idea that cooking similar to
programming is a very collaborative

859
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,700
art and you're making something in the
kitchen with a bunch of people and so we

860
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,670
we took this onto a couple times

861
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,569
we went around United States around
europe a little bit we've been in Japan

862
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:25,050
where we just kind of hookup and

863
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,260
with people and and curate mean you know
driver eight or nine hours poor chicago

864
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,790
the tour we did what we did hope I get
here in 2006

865
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,480
we're in the middle but were we went
from San Francisco to Maine to Florida

866
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,210
back

867
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,380
10,000 miles in a biodiesel station
wagon we had

868
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,230
sixty dinner parties in 32 days we like
dry for a while point to a town

869
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,560
for the farmers market got our friends
house could get over 25 people make a

870
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,680
six or seven course meal

871
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,828
and the drive to the next town the next
day as super fine we got to cope with

872
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:51,530
tons of our friends and family I think

873
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,940
that's an interesting thing about black
cat food hacking is that you are up

874
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,680
your creating a restaurant where that
people get the touch the food

875
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,578
and as you're not supposed to be able to
do that in a restaurant if you could

876
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:02,640
write about supper club

877
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,759
as people creating and executing this
but it's just their vision and your

878
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,190
customer going and you're not part a bad
experience

879
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,319
so this is kind of a big mosaic about
the food that that a Clojure fourth

880
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:17,450
checker stuff out to I especially like
this weird kale thing up here that the

881
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,460
unicorns hair

882
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,930
and the little a creepy lichi hanging up
there

883
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,970
and of course we also made a bunch of
the month a

884
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,680
for a lot different steps were the
things we did was offered on this

885
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,210
website report back idea

886
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,060
where you have to take what you buy the
past two weeks in magazine out a bit

887
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,109
newscast they put together in the path
about your friends and be like hey look

888
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:37,049
we did visualization this week

889
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,599
%uh hungry I don't know what the goat
feed us 4 for

890
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,450
kinda weird a slide but the I'm hungry

891
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,290
this from talking to you guys if you
talk about for is the hope your day so

892
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,369
does made the stuff

893
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:51,690
I help out as well I mean I was fruit
leather I was blending all the

894
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,369
a row so much a fan of but that was to
drive try to put the parchment over its

895
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:56,349
ok with steam

896
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:59,569
and we keep some the moisture inside a
bit but awesome olive oil salt and

897
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:00,430
cayenne

898
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,770
and the Rose did that and it took out
blended that with some pineapples I push

899
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,819
the pineapples

900
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:08,009
skulk up and down by their self with
them some star needs and above that

901
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,960
together in the Cuisinart

902
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,470
and kind of spread it out it then stick
on a cookie sheet sanded them in the

903
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,460
hydrator

904
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,640
and then I roll them up after about 12
hours have been hydrating

905
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,779
I brought them here to hope and about
some sausages from san Francisco is well

906
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,640
they were cured together and get food
poisoning

907
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,520
you're welcome and then a and then you
have them into what some

908
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,859
yeah beautiful but by a guy right there
10 he brings eggs over sometime

909
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:33,779
and the jewels may be super pastry cream
two different kinds of spices and stuff

910
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,950
like that so it's like a star knees
pastry cream

911
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,730
ago pastry cream was like bay leaf and
cardamom and it's just the center of

912
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,390
it's just fun to cook for about two
people and haven't aged have something

913
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,009
extra

914

bit about the direction that we're going

918
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,640
in as far as I cuisine goes

919
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,930
so that's a now I'm just gonna say I
described the few genome

920
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,700
we're gonna we are open source amicus
first but available is a platform for

921
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,650
other people to make food aP's

922
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,089
and food games so if you have any ideas
begin touch with us

923
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:13,130
please Twitter with us talk to us about
food tell us what you've been making

924
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,770
make that a part of the dialogue up the
hacker community to tell your own story

925
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:17,700
because

926
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,780

00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,710
exists which

935
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:06,180
to the back make

936
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,950
and and the tart ice really could even
go into more stuff because we have these

937
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:10,810
PBS's

938
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,240
evolves kinda weird food they were here
seems to go over things into a bar on

939
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,060
dot com

940
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:19,029
anybody rhonda conrail a run aka sorry
to this dinner for run are calm some

941
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,440
sort of anniversary we try to make the
most disgusting food possible

942
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,030
%uh so with this is that this is I think
blood the black custard

943
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,819
we take pics blood and mix that with the
civil zoom in

944
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:33,529
we take pics bloody mix it up with cream
and then kind of made a hour

945
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:38,180
you know that a custard is a cap in have
pics but in cream and oats if this leads

946
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,640
area so cases black hazards of pics
blood with cream in it

947
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,640
and then we chilled it in the fridge and
a pickle sugar on it and torched it

948
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,650
and it was like cold blood meal and then
a scab was on top of you taste that is

949
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,540
the exact like a scab

950
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:56,099
pretty awesome well secretary for ice
cream with your taste like

951
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:00,099
nastiness with us we also did up black
um

952
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:03,359
kinda made like a black olive oil this
is kinda good black cod poached in

953
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,560
vietnam

954
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,520
in its owner in black oil have for the
efficient black oil to how to make black

955
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,200
oil

956
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,210
rate well you get its black olive oil

957
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,450
right but how to get a black olive oil
we just a you get a bunch

958
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:20,839
olives any branch in four times together
the brine flavor out of them

959
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:23,980
and then you blame them I dehydrate them
look at all the water out of them

960
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,430
similar again oh may be off the internet
and anybody

961
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:30,740
year ago it's on now you glance them
four times you take

962
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,030
you take all those out to hydrate the
big all the water out a bit and then you

963
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:34,930
just have these

964
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:40,410
fatty a you know fat solids a olive and
puts them with just a olive oil it turns

965
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,069
black

966
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:44,470
breadth evil black but it tasted like
olive oil and its kinda nice for the oil

967
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:45,130
spill

968
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,500
re: with the question who's got a
question RA so can you make that

969
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,140
saw does that soccer let you take the
food genomes about see the whole family

970
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,819
and figure out recipes that everyone's
going like yeah I should have said that

971
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:59,430
her

972
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,529
I'm yes okay that's very full

973
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,650
yes so what's a what's your favorite
food

974
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,480
well I can have it that often but really
nice roast beef sandwich

975
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,589
W really touch much about the diet stuff
but we also know what food vegetarian

976
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:16,520
with buchanan what's good for silly acts
what's good for diabetics MAPI for that

977
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,339
we can feed it like was on your

978
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:21,540
suggests replacements for things like
that i think thats a key thing

979
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,359
especially families re se

980
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,230
what that is for kids and maybe this is
stupid cellphone game that teaches the

981
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,270
kids but what

982
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,230
to put in the food that they hate for
that they already had a they don't like

983
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,220
or that they want to try rather
interesting

984
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,780
hopefully there are cute and a male
looking an end kinda generating recipes

985
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,720
based on that

986
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,510
so W this is very similar to the
previous year question but

987
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,160
is actually the opposite now if I have a
whole bunch to different food

988
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,540
I don't know to make from it is a
possible using API or an application

989
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,020
that myself for Sonos to write and say

990
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,220
how these go there together which one of
these could I put together what clay and

991
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:54,940
make

992
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,380
yet yeah percent that's like what's
there are until the recipe website

993
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,670
you're doing that now

994
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,210
a in terms i love it's just a search say
I have salt and bread

995
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,730
it says the game itself amateur whatever
it tells you to make her

996
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,430
I have no I just haven't found one of
those yet do you know the one that does

997
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,379
that they all suck

998
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,690
a I think Lake I don't know there's a
bunch of them to search for you

999
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,230
and that's it is where the at I remember
all the names but the

1000
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,160
I think it should take about ours that
learns what you like and what you have

1001
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,240
and haven't had

1002
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,609
and its and in addition to that we have
some weird precise offer that's actually

1003
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,960
creates use it for creating we're dishes
its kinda suggesting strange dishes and

1004
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,440
strange combinations a food

1005
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,470
purses figuring out the ones that people
we know that we are delighted to take a

1006
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,250
look at you and say

1007
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,510
well you're your vegan and you hate
pasta so these are some foods you like

1008
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,190
it's kind of looking at the whole

1009
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,680
3 similar to have about a Pandora what
saying people that you type in all

1010
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,859
through that you've been eating

1011
00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:50,740
you nobody like Chinese review on
sandwiches and it says where's for that

1012
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,569
you were probably like because other
people who also meet these things would

1013
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:54,589
like these things

1014
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:57,328
so yes you can query the stuff that's in
your fridge and I can tell you these

1015
00:47:57,329 --> 00:47:58,569
recipes you can make

1016
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:02,710
others noted aside thanks

1017
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,819
what up a to simple yet

1018
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:10,369
I don't have any myself cure for my head
is a jewish

1019
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:13,400
can you put restrictions for kosher yes
we have kosher

1020
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,260
a wall what other religions do we have
it's part of the world taxonomy if you

1021
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,849
go to for genome

1022
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:23,430
slash region is like all the continents
and that we might be super slow because

1023
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,940
everyone hitting it and we

1024
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,470
circuit scaling the mission rewrite our
website for three of them

1025
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,910
I get as a religion taxonomy that allows
us to

1026
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,029
has like buddhist food

1027
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,230
yeah kosher whole of all that stuff so
whether

1028
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:43,280
is there any it's just replacements for
those things to say to make this was on

1029
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,329
your kosher

1030
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:48,490
take that you love it sounds growth is
our ability to expand this into

1031
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,670
something like mixed drinks are $1

1032
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:55,170
get different ones around the world your
personal like what just weird things up

1033
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,780
work yes the question is is very
possible to expand it to mix drinks

1034
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,130
a yeah we have let me follow just
friends her fetus their data I think

1035
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,160
there's anything it's

1036
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,290
up eating a chef's ok why into it
feeding to

1037
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,300
all of Julia Child's cookbook Spurs just
one Julia Child

1038
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,420
or all the ships there in a city and say
according to Thomas Keller from the

1039
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,390
French Laundry

tallow gives me the shits

1042
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:25,009
so don't don't mix it in with something
a so yes that is

1043
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,540
a the yes yes that person not yet is
there a way to filter out according to

1044
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,480
you know

1045
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,760
I wanna suck my diet according to the
tools I have routes for travel I'd like

1046
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,900
to meet I'll play around with my food
but

1047
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,410
what at most times only have like a
frying pan right yeah that was one other

1048
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:39,740
early

1049
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,440
so we have a quick min list you can be
if we build the kitchen object and if

1050
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,059
it's not because all the stuff that's in
your kitchen the food that's your

1051
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:46,010
kitchen equipment

1052
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:49,599
think they I'm camping I just have a
Dutch oven and a river

1053
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,200
grave and say all right we gotta chill
the pasta down so

1054
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,849
put in the bag and put in the river des
pantyhose you know ever

1055
00:49:56,849 --> 00:50:00,380
kinda think so yes there's a there's a
quick minute fraction a that knows the

1056
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,240
whole taxonomy that's on the web I think
it's

1057
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,780
I think we it's live a that that
understands the equipment that's in your

1058
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,300
kitchen

1059
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,990
and also indeed the ships that are in
your kitchen so a catch like ours

1060
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,290
inappropriate think you have

1061
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,210
ships come by and you could say given
all the ships have been in our kitchen

1062
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,059
the past year what we make

1063
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:19,119
and by and based on our equipment market
what equipment you have you get a frying

1064
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:19,750
pan

1065
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,579
I a frank and maybe something to stir
stop in on a cutting board that's

1066
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,220
basically rate which can I for one

1067
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,859
for Hannah yeah I know that's that's yes
the

1068
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:32,348
you feel that the same thing at the
differences I talked earlier about her

1069
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:33,540
sixty different objects

1070
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,308
basically one of his equipment and has
all the subsequence to seek as a spoon

1071
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:37,829
or

1072
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:44,050
slotted spoon soup spoon all that other
shit alright thanks

1073
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:47,950
is I was going back to my seat a
realized they had a couple ago that's

1074
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:54,579
on so how do you encompass beams that
are kinda outside of what you

1075
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:58,700
what you're describing in your tax money
like for example home

1076
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,890
modern font software deals with

1077
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:05,250
things like Sarah sin turning what
happens when

1078
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,720
certain letters go together so for
example let's say you wanna make that

1079
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,359
black

1080
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,730
olive oil or you wanna make cookies that
are either crunchy or soft

1081
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:17,960
but have similar ingredients but you
just treat them differently

1082
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,260
rate or if you wanna over like my
grandmother taught me how to make crepes

1083
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,420
that have a handle on them by just

1084
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,990
boring a little different Lisa Fischer
is little bump on it you know stuff like

1085
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:27,400
that

1086
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,270
so you rephrase your question okay so
how do you so

1087
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,290
the kind of stuff that's outside have a
recipe that outside have just graduated

1088
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,160
and spray

1089
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,440
okay yeah so that changes they can
drastically change

1090
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,240
yeah it's it's our it's a hard thing and
I think I mean ideally be set of

1091
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,170
as being this you know our ultimate goal
is to be the programming language for

1092
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:48,559
the

1093
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,890
replicators on Star Trek rate you go t
earl grey hot

1094
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:55,220
it fucking make city it's been a great
time but you know

1095
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:59,210
how to use you oversleep it you Steve it
so we hope we break it down to that

1096
00:51:59,210 --> 00:51:59,680
level

1097
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,160
where you are as far as the techniques
go but yeah I thought you can find

1098
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,680
its it simply because because the main
language we started it was English

1099
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,369
its its not every corner language
persons like the French attorneys which

1100
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:11,369
are these huge

1101
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:14,960
ancient mother cuisines that have
specific words for what you just said

1102
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,460
adding handle on to a crepe

1103
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:21,010
or its us giving scum of the toppers a
skinny fat of the top these are you know

1104
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,690
different words never concepts

1105
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,960
as I think with red touch on that there
is internationalization

1106
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,240
aspect where you would be able to if we
brought in a bunch a Brazilian

1107
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,720
food on a budget Chinese trivial task it
you know I am

1108
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,740
I have I I live in China speak Spanish

1109
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:39,240
I want you know what it was I wanna go
to the store in China

1110
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,180
I need the words up the ingredients and
the recipe in Spanish is it that you

1111
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,950
have kind of

1112
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,990
changing internationalize things but i
think thats but the trick about

1113
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:51,490
having different concepts but Gatto its
it's such a narrow problem domain

1114
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:54,609
I think that's a solvable problem but
how many terms are there how many

1115
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:55,450
special

1116
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:59,339
you know a shake we have a pinch rada
pensions like a sixteenth but the spirit

1117
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:00,359
or something right

1118
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:04,500
so we can take these colloquial terms
but they because they have contacts

1119
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,440
and they say well this is from the
fifties a this teaspoon is from the US

1120
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,180
fifties versus the current he's better
from England it so you have these

1121
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,329
different ideas that

1122
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:16,660
the different you it's a measure are
different different regions as well

1123
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,109
wall another example was you probably
know this better than me I don't

1124
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:21,089
remember the

1125
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:24,359
author who wrote this but there was a
15-page

1126
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,630
how to fry an egg right red velvet how
to

1127
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:32,000
bring up the chicken and what what to
feed it during all those years and

1128
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,230
so I mean I mean that when I try to be
the editorial solution to getting rid of

1129
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,589
all recipes and you know just tryin to

1130
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:41,230
you know think a family recipes there on
the internet and there's about a million

1131
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:44,920
we just wanna in a razor by a factor of
a hundred or something and and

1132
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,500
make tons more and make me take them all
and if you look at a recipe

1133
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,710
there's always secrets that you're not
actually doing in the recipe but

1134
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,900
should at least give you recipes are
small part of what Fujino

1135
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,579
is because it's it's about the pairings
about respite taking that recipe out and

1136
00:53:58,579 --> 00:53:59,079
saying

1137
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:03,020
well this recipe has meat and herbs
right and extracting it out so that you

1138
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,819
know that

1139
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:06,420
that knew you had yesterday had me
innards and it's time for you to have

1140
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,829
something that just vegetables and herbs
because you are you had me

1141
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:12,119
you set this threshold that says the
only one have me two or three times a

1142
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:12,650
week

1143
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,829
so are another clever get really that's
where all recipes

1144
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:19,700
but the you know trying to qualify as
much as I can then you can have more

1145
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,030
objects to the whole point

1146
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,390
I'm just saying is to leave room for
expansion yeah that's kinda

1147
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:28,150
yes yeah hopefully it's just woke up its
brain it'll hopefully learn more

1148
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,829
you really do thanks

1149
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:35,510
hi I'm this is gonna sound really random
but I recently signed up for this thing

1150
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,750
called 23 in me

1151
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,280
free spin the company give you genome on
the issue raw data

1152
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,819
back to and back to you I'm aid weeks
later

1153
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:48,329
home so perhaps would you consider

1154
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:51,970
taking raw human genome data getting
into the Fuji

1155
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,480
citrate yeah I think that's super
interesting I think about how did you

1156
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,609
know sequencer this is right here make
it the perfect big night food

1157
00:54:57,609 --> 00:55:00,710
what I do is you would set up to make a
reservation a fancy restaurant

1158
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:04,559
you need a teacher first date you send
your genome profiles then right

1159
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,400
and then you make chewing gums that have
the genetic Cinco did right and then you

1160
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,540
get to swap it

1161
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:14,089
right you feel like you on each other's
genetics at the beginning of the meal

1162
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:18,619
and see %uh it is kinda stinky I don't
think I have a service relationship

1163
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:22,210
see i think there's a huge opportunity
and I welcome anyone suggesting any

1164
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,369
weird combinations of colors of things
or

1165
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:28,619
or a human genetic some big into eating
people so

1166
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:32,240
its there's also on that note a

1167
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,040
who foo if you hear are you familiar
with who it's a it's a

1168
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,599
from a vegan a human flash some right
Ray Ray Ray

1169
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:44,490
Wow to yet we have a test we did begin
blood for viewing office

1170
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,589
right because they wanna drink blood but
you know it to be relied

1171
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:50,770
and so was I i think is that are being
is a beach use of course it was like

1172
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:54,180
dehydrated parsley for the core fill for
the campaign you taste

1173
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,010
and I'd make you an enormous oil commits
a material which is the stuff that firms

1174
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:58,970
up tofu

1175
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,549
and so you can actually take the blood
and use it as a co I don't use that as a

1176
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:05,759
at the firm up basically when you
because you but it uses a thickener

1177
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,960
gonna put in a vegan sausage you can
make a big in blood sausage at the

1178
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,140
Beacon blood because it would

1179
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,319
picking up because I had this Nikki
Ryann differences thousand

1180
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:16,980
are you

1181
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,150
have you guys done anything with like
brewing or

1182
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,650
cheese production insider this iowa
coach ease

1183
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:27,150
a yeah I don't we have we have we have
cheese taxonomy

1184
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,920
I just I know nothing about brewing when
those people who just leaves huge

1185
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,619
areas love a knowledge

1186
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:37,410
I like being here in the future is a
knowledge that eventually wear discover

1187
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,140
it like it is starting a coffee about a
year ago

1188
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,348

Spurrier a

1189
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:45,020
about how it's been a bit but because
I'm discovering it for the past year so

1190
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,970
I would be totally open to discovering
more about bringing trying to understand

1191
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,250
how that taxonomy

1192
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,410
built in but definitely a threat to
define terms a cheese especially in the

1193
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,569
with a lot development in a vegan cheese
area too with all the Gunners in the

1194
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:56,859
ritual act and

1195
00:56:56,859 --> 00:57:00,170
different kinds of net net net books
that are fermented and stuff like that

1196
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,609
you said you guys are in bed sty %uh
with that one place that we go to dinner

1197
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:05,259

what yeah

1200
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:20,440
alright well i i just their generally
have

1201
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,750
any of the say proly except for getting
in touch with earth

1202
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,650
I don't have much had a bunch of other
weird slide on a show you guys but the

1203
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,860
there when we play a a fine with that
think go ahead with your

1204
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,260
for this is why right

1205
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:40,280
be in particular are just people in
general okay

1206
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,080
yeah I love this is why you're fat yeah
that's cuz interesting idea terms a diet

1207
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,950
I think it's super important especially
with a obesity epidemic people eating

1208
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,530
corn people are reading i think thats

1209
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,050
really courage the crystallization it
here is how the food breaks out

1210
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:57,340
for the beef that you're reading and how
that breaks out into corn purses

1211
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,820
grassroots the soil things like that i
think thats super interest I would like

1212
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,330
to be a platform that people would use
for that sorta thing

1213
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,750
I cortex what everybody

1214
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,770
