it's really hard to do this within a
dog's children and

9
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,489
electronically generated noises they
always leave the third one of

10
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,489
so everybody is here for the social
engineering they don't break

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:56,850
okay

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,989

for

52
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,739
high and Kevin and I use to be a social
engineer

53
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:52,739
for use to be I i think we're still
trying to figure out how the phone works

54
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,420
are settled is this the phone it's a
touchdown from

55
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,630
beautiful model know something about
this burning a

56
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,950
Klassiker Western Electric telephone
company property

57
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,830
I'm touchdown found with a real mechanic
a ring up

58
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,859
and was specially modified with
noise-canceling microphone picks on me

59
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,839
will be called people during his talk we
don't want them to hear you guys

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,410
laughing

61
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,410
and was a push to talk a switch here so
that

62
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,720
only when one officer pushing it down
will be here if so

63
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,860
with basically cuts out more laps
laughter which I would

64
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,889
blow the whole think so that's what we
do this front this from was built in

65
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,620
1977 according to what it says on the
bottom

66
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,820
how many think you're a your cell phones
again be around for over 30 years

67
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,310
all right arm

68
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,789
when we started an anecdote side maybe
gusts would be a good time for you tell

69
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:53,310
your record and you know them all

70
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,729
will well maybe try some demonstrations
take suggestions you don't wanna you

71
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,300
wanna talk about welcome demonstrations
were doing to the first oh I don't know

72
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,630
on

73
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,630
I'm still thinking about that actually I
couldn't find an econ book so I have to

74
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,400
sort of come up with things on the web
but

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,590
for working on I'm gonna put this in a
hypothetical second person

76
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,760
on it happened a friend of mine and as
well as sort of

77
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,969
imagine if this happened to you messin
you have a name that's relatively common

78
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,450
say friend's name is Jennifer Smith on
so

79
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,590
person happened to get Jay Smith at
gmail dot com

80
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,160
pretty amazing everybody on the internet
suddenly believes that

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,190
J Smith gmail dot com belongs to them

82
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,300
so J Smith Gmail got dot com begins to
get email saying hi how are your tax

83
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,200
returns

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,490
hi honey speeches in a car wreck I'm

85
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,389
Anders giant gaping star pictures and
maybe

86
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,310
pictures make a ship here's the person
calling from

87
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,539
you know the job you just interviewed
for and we wanted to get back in touch

88
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,450
with the UN and talk a little bit
further about this job opportunity

89
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,330
exactly happened so you end up with a
great deal of information about people

90
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,050
and

91
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,770
on ways you can slot yourself into their
storyline in some way

92
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,729
see somebody who's this email address to
sign you up for Facebook

93
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:09,599
say somebody say for example that
Facebook doesn't quite calculate

94
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,550
email address is the same way that Sun
gmail those where if you put a period at

95
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,280
you did J

96
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,150
doc Smith were G judge a Smith that
could be two different accounts where

97
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,630
isn't you know it's only one account on

98
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,289
maybe you can login to that person's
Facebook account pretty easy to change

99
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,090
the password

100
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,340
maybe they already logged in themself
maybe they already had a couple friends

101
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,120
could you perhaps look at who those
people's friends were in begin befriend

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,680
them and build your own friend network

103
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,510
sales person was summer in another state

104
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,830
what would you do could you for example

105
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,979
is so see

106
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,789
people started saying yes to friend
requests

107
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,120
without even knowing who you were

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,520
to the tune of a hundred people not even
questioning

109
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,460
that this person who claims to be
Jennifer Smith at gmail dot com

110
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,789
is the person is editor doesn't don't
challenge once

111
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:11,520
say begin to populate that Facebook
account with the things that you've been

112
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,299
getting from the Gmail and

113
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,400
address like a here's the pictures of
the car wreck point I was kinda a pain

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,200
here's a picture for ski vacation nice
picture baby

115
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,789
as the profile photo do you think that
perhaps

116
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:29,140
somebody mites say it was certainly give
you want us

117
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,940
little Facebook or try ko you're the
best dad because you have a baby

118
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,140
in our best mama whatever so I'm

119
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,760
was gonna say that this a this happen
this all happens and

120
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,840
my friend ended up with a friend at work
in Kentucky

121
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,729
love eighty people who have never once
challenge that she was who says she said

122
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:50,380
she was before she took it down said
this is ridiculous I can't do this no

123
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:50,890
longer

124
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,849
sewer social engineering can be done

125
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,020
because people just give you this stuff

126
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,169
happens me

127
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:08,539
here

128
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,150
okay was stolen working out the phone
kinks and I think Evans gotta

129
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,599
a story to share are we do that when the
story okay

130
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,878
mom West I said I was on the panel two
years ago and I don't recall

131
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,550
told a story but i wanna say it again I
covered the story about the social

132
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,139
engineering talk to Motorola

133
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,059
does anyone remember yes or no by that

134
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:33,560
no Motorola

135
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,800
ok that was a different one look at the
different art

136
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,260
I'll tell this one so at the time it was
a

137
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,500
1993 I'm living in Denver Colorado

138
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,000
at the time I wasn't living under the
name ever kevin Mitnick because certain

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,100
law enforcement agencies want to speak
with me

140
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:57,100
and i dont wanna talk to them so

141
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,190
I was living under the name is Eric
Weiss why Eric Weiss because that

142
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,990
is the real name for the famous magician
Harry Houdini

143
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,269
I thought I have a sense of humor but
later I found out the F

144
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,069
later I found that the FBI had no sense
of humor but that's a story for another

145
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:13,610
day

146
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,250
suck the time I wanna buy a arm

147
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,449
colleagues at the law firm where I was
working and handed me

148
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:24,630
a brochure for the Microtech ultralight
cell phone it was cool about the cell

149
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,079
phone

150
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,410
is a look like a Star Trek communicator
kind of like the iPhone of today

151
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,529
and I wanted to get the source code
because I wanted to see

152
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:36,130
actually how this phone work I wanted to
become

153
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,250
more invisible to the network because at
the time I was running from the

154
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,839

191
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:45,149

192
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:48,589
well she told me that she didn't have

193
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,709
to do this for me that I can call you
that you would help me out just what you

194
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,910
need wreck I said hi me but I E the
source code for the

195
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,750
Microtech ultralight by this time I'm
walking down the streets up Denver

196
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,800
it's knowing there's horns honking this
is all extemporaneous

197
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,399
so there's no preparation knows a little
bit nervous because you could hear

198
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,100
background noise again have a
noise-canceling microphone and

199
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,230
myself for and she goes

200
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:19,620
well-read what version do you want

201
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,730
and I didn't prepare I had no idea so I
just said

202
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,380
how about the latest and the greatest so
I could hear typing on the computer

203
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,780
she's fishing around on their network
and after about

204
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,470
45 minutes she comes back because record
I found the latest release to the

205
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,650
Microtech ultralight

206
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,980
but there's a problem what is it

207
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,730
she goes well there's hundreds
directories and within the directories

208
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,050
as hundreds of miles

209
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,240
and I go what do you want to use
torrents easier

210
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,240
and she goes no idea which would like to
learn if she goes yes

211
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,250
so I became her instructor for the day

212
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,360
saffir the day's lesson

213
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,529
we have a3 megabyte file that the source
code that I want to look at summit next

214
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:12,420
questioner is a

215
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,810
do not use FTP then she doesn't file
transfer program ago yes precisely

216
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,959
so think about this I'm walking down the
street it's all of the CAF

217
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,520
at 10 minutes away from my apartment
hand

218
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,170
I couldn't give ur my IP address hacker
dot Colorado do you write because that's

219
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,570
how the submarine this campus

220
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,470
but fortunately had a good knack for
remembering numbers from my phone for

221
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,180
King days

222
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,190
net remembered an IP address have a
system where there was another anonymous

223
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,910
account sites to try to open up a
connection to this IP address

224
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,240
and she try the kept timing out twice
three times

225
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,160
she goes record over she does I'm gonna
talk to my security manager but when

226
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,660
you're asking me to do because I can
open a connection

227
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,110
and I do know because she's armory on
hold and I go oh my god no

228
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,570
obviously this big the jig is up some
thinking as I'm walking down the street

229
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,250
me know

230
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,860
when you're waiting for something how
seconds become it it's met it's become

231
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,920
hours and you know I was getting nervous

232
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,450
more nervous as the time went on think
you know they're going to hook up a tape

233
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,160
recorder that's gonna be exhibit a

234
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,060
later

235
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,540
so she comes back on the phone she does
record but Palmer

236
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,439
notice I'm not speaking she goes well I
spoke to my security manager about what

237
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,410
you're asking me to do

238
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,500
mom and that IP address

239
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,670
you gave me is outside of Motorola's
campus

240
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,990
haha I'm well

241
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,450
my manager told me that to send you this
file we have to use a special proxy

242
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,110
server

243
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,800
so he was kind enough to give me his
username and password to send you the

244
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,800
file

245
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,349
so by the time I have put the key in the
front door

246
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,660
my apartment and Denver the source code
to the micro talk ultralight was sitting

247
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,469
on the box

248
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,279
so I think that really all straight
suffered an impact the social

249
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,439
engineering you could have

250
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:20,349
the best technology money can buy if you
have a good gift to gab

251
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,559
and you find the right targets within an
organization

252
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,669
that bypasses all the technologies so
they're eager

253
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:33,669
awesome

254
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:38,620
fitness it's all about getting people to
trust you to get get people on your side

255
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,620
when you're on your side they'll help
you out even if what they're doing makes

256
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,529
absolutely no sense whatsoever

257
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:48,499
you can a Kevin's got a great fun
personality so is able to get people to

258
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:49,769
trust him when he's

259
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,779
talking to them on the phone and wiser

260
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,670
for you damn you and a large range

261
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,079
for those that are the whole trust issue
here is what they've they

262
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,439
getting the information from the
managers voicemail that she was on

263
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,040
vacation in leveraging that

264
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,219
in building the perfect way it's getting
more and more information as you go

265
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,980
along so that

266
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,259
when you are ready to make your final
phone call you know your sched

267
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,939
and they believe you and your more
authoritarian and they are

268
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:20,980
so they feel they don't listen to. they
don't do what you ask they might be in

269
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,470
trouble

270
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,240
so that's something the to always use to
your advantage

271
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,290
I'm I've been thinking about the

272
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,269
potential things to do arm and I it's
tough because I I guess I can find a

273
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:34,509
phone book so dismissive

274
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:37,759
carousing around here on the net and I'm

275
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,410
Isar about you guys if if you're as
upset as I am about this whole

276
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,969
BP fiasco II you pissed off about this
yeah

277
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:51,519
I mean what the hell poring over oil
into the Gulf and nobody seems to care

278
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,209
anymore

279
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,920
i'm happy to say that the first day of
hope was the first day that they capped

280
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,819
the damn thing

281
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:00,540
sounds for regardless

282
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,970
regardless I would like to just for pros
that tonight's

283
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,809
I serve a special thank you that we do
only BP related calls

284
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:15,809
house now

285
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,530
I am working on something here at like I

286
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,510
not Kevin and we have a dog on the panel
and the maybe that we can introduce each

287
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,650
other and the sperm

288
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,960
we can get some some phone shenanigans
go ahead house

289
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,330
touted before you what do you do what
have you done well when ames 97 as a sub

290
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,629
for anti-social engineer my way on this
panel but what is your name a few names

291
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,470

292
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,400
well my name's not kevin Mitnick which
is probably why I'm up here

293
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,150
things that confuse um well let's see

294
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,780
so I can clearly see the audience very
well but attorney

295
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,720
almost college-age kids here can you can
you raise your hands for outside a

296
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,910
little story for you guys

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,720
so as urs you know you probably like me
you're all very lazy

298
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,880
so I've when I was applying for colleges
I with the absolute last moment to

299
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,230
some applications and I realize

300
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,300
the a couple hours before deposition
that mind that I hadn't even started yet

301
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,659
so a I did whatever we do I went to
sleep

302
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,330
and in the morning I woke up and I
called up the

303
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,350
the college admissions officer the

304
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,430
Pacific University I was looking to get

324
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,320
so such internet is not always about you
know doing lessons things more

325
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,490
a self-serving sometimes I guess the
news that same tactic to get populated

326
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,070
badge here

327
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,820
I can answer either works or not to
sometimes

328
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,860
on the road in 10

329
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,420
this is Sid Vicious the world's only and
pry the best social engineer hacker dog

330
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,320
around so

331
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,090
'em but say he's got me into a central
office or

332
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,179
got me and tobacco bank vault a.m. he's
got me out over

333
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,560
very very expensive ticket a so that's
why the most self-serving thing that

334
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,840
he's done and I am I live down the
desert and

335
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,010
Las Vegas sir Nevada and you can drive
fast

336
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,230
driving long distances and I got pulled
over

337
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,170
share further patrol officer is really
pissed off in no speeding through its

338
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,870
territory he came up to the window

339
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,630
and the starter Tommy took my red
license or registration when all this

340
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,470
and then after came back and started
writing a ticket news after a while

341
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,110
driving so fast and weaken

342
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,720
you CAN bus because I gotta go over like
95 and

343
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,020
I roll down the window a little bit so
so could get some air

344
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,139
and within about like 30 seconds of
talking to him the of service like pet

345
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,880
said

346
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,860
and he likes got some water you know is
composition change from me

347
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,080
commit a felony through its territory to
my dog has got wider

348
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,629
water so after a couple minutes here

349
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,260
his like to tell you I dollar I write
this for a lot less you don't get as

350
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,290
many points and you can actually go to
traffic school so he wrote it for like

351
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,909
25 miles an hour under what the clock
before so

352
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,680
not resolve I know it was just like this
crack the window a little bit said just

353
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,250
started talking from a little bit

354
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,160
his his live abandoned and saber

355
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,360
you know lobbyists in so much trouble so
actually learn something everyday votes

356
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,740
a new york city traffic tickets if you
haven't heard this on

357
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,880
once they start writing the ticket they
can't stop but if you catch them before

358
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,950
hands waterworks

359
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,540
might work for you almost for free but
the officers like no I can't do it

360
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,909
I started to rate the ticket so a few
min filled in a plan to me in

361
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,630
as my summer tickets for social engineer
I think that was what I did

362
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,300
okay but there's a better way we can go
to any together even after the guy right

363
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,900
for

364
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,290
ok but tell do tell but I don't know if
it works I works in california work some

365
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:46,700
of it

366
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,800
and Nevada of course I never did right

367
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,200
and if I did they would have passed the
statute of limitations that's my

368
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,140
disclaimer

369
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,620
so want to get the ticket get the
officers a a

370
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,270
serial number about a number and the
name 30 no are what agency he is with

371
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,090
you have a court date to go and certain
states

372
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,370
if the officer doesn't show up a

373
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,500
a court big-ticket publicly dismissed so

374
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,130
you do have to go through the process of
scheduling a trial day which means

375
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,190
posting bail and

376
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,560
at arraignment but usually don't have a
good or a min he just simply

377
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,570
prepay the ticket but you don't want it
on your record of course

378
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,139
so what you up the court date then it's
all

379
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,700
just america calling I what they call
subpoena control happy

380
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,150
agency usually like LAPD California
Highway Patrol

381
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,830
Hannah of course I would recommend this
but some people in the past have

382
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,419
impersonated the court

383
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,620
and they told the subpoena control that
the court date has been trail to a

384
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,290
different day

385
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,060
like a week later so what happens as the
cop doesn't show up

386
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:02,060
the judge dismisses the ticket and
you're done

387
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,740
okay we're ready to do the first the
first call I'll hopefully the first of

388
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,250
many

389
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,530
said anything about this contraption
just pick it up season

390
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,590
it's a letter i picking up to I had a
thing

391
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,800
first

392
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,310
hands this incident anonymity

393
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,389
KR on now when I'm gonna do

394
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,260
the pics plan I'm gonna call station a
gas station I don't know if they're open

395
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,810
sea

396
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,790
we've been planning this out it's not
that scripted or anything like that so

397
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,409
I'll large part of social engineering is
failing and I'm

398
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,410
we may fail and that's something you
have to get used to the other thing is

399
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,520
the quick getaway when when when
somebody makes you

400
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,800
are that you know you're trying to get
something that must get

401
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,450
in a way to gracefully back out so that
all alarms aren't raised

402
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,710
so one gonna try that now so about it
but the receiver

403
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,000
okay and

404
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,690
30 down number now I'm just picking a
station at random

405
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,690

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,379

engineering stuff that has some sort of

456
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,730
social good thing

457
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,440
more recently and I was looking some the
GT g20 protests videos from Toronto

458
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,000
were couple three weeks ago and

459
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,360
yes I love her pretty disturbing me just
from

460
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,120
mass police forces these guys decked out
in incredible riot gear and

461
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,000
and a in one video I saw on the place
for intimidating the crowd with a green

462
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,620
laser with that that was that's weird

463
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,600
on but then would really treat me like
15 seconds more to the video which

464
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,000
I'd hope to show you but I was just
taken down over YouTube so I can show

465
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,590
and I just ordered my fault but anyway

466
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,130
would ice on the next few seconds at
this video within just a good night I'm

467
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,490
the the the police in the right here
we're marching away

468
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,100
from a crowd and they all have these
blue lights on the backs of their necks

469
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,310
and had never seen that before they like
20-30 Compton right here

470
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,870
marching signal finally offered a blue
light in the back the next what the heck

471
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,590
this is because I'm

472
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,800
I I'm really intrigued by technology
haven't seen before put these provides

473
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,310
might have to be bugging me for like a
week and then just

474
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:39,710
by dumb lock one other law enforcement
technology magazines i subscribe to

475
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,960
a with email to me and in

476
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,850
in the in that issue there is an ad in
the in the side column

477
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,010
in header a for a product called

478
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,180
triage lights which is this this is
possibly but I saw

479
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,080
the parent loses product called triage
lights penis but like triage

480
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,820
and what they are and law enforcement or
are using these now

481
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,870
it says something to identify law
enforcement to other law enforcement

482
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:13,840
as friendly you know military has used
this technology years I i called i FF

483
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,700
identification Friend or Foe

484
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,070
in radar systems like trying to counter
measures but this is great

485
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,139
so I call the company makes these things
%uh convince them

486
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,070
that I was a a dealer are some equipment
to

487
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,780
local law enforcement agencies in the
Philadelphia area and I needed to sample

488
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,810
the ones devices

489
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,960
and they would which me for free but it
wasn't

490
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,170
looks like 40 some dollars on so we're

491
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,960
give a credit card number they shipped
it to me and this thing is neat on

492
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,900
it's a about the size over a pill bottle
and you can adjust it for any

493
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,330
any color in the visible spectrum
include and even infrared

494
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,149
and you can make it flash a different
rates as well so if you know

495
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,150
the color of the day and the duty cycle
like the flash rate that the day

496
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,400
you too can identify yourself as
friendly to the police

497
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,420
so I brought this thing to hoping to get
here is this going to see a light it's

498
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,030
not a big deal

499
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,389
but I am a taken a candidate the
hardware hacking your you were to

500
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,940
reverse engineer this thing and

501
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,560
and the publish a low-cost alternative
to this

502
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,889
we want to get the brightness
incomparable sold it's the same

503
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,690
brightness

504
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,270
in the same flash rates natural thing so
would so it's plausible

505
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,260
but on I don't know how much to be
considered a social engineering hack in

506
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,850
the day but it is fooling

507
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,870
people when they see something into
thinking it's something

508
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,680
that it's not and I think everybody
should identify themselves as friendly

509
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,350
to the police

510
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:44,350
so for you

511
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,408
especially when they're carrying guns
and clubs and things like that

512
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:52,740
so on a just a little hack on well that
will talk about this on off the hook

513
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,529
probably next couple weeks about the the
solution to how you too can identify

514
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,029
yourself as friendly to the police

515
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:02,460
%ah just of the 2600 dot com slash

516
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,799
of the book will be talking about on the
show in the next couple three weeks

517
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:10,379
know how long does own terms into cuba
con how how long before somebody turns

518
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,659
it into a TV B Gone

519
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:14,710
you could cause it does what does what
went on a picnic and modulate those

520
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,600
types over

521
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,820
codes just promo flashing raise but
stupid question

522
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:25,820

523
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,990

a good night Press

576
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:06,680
hi I don't know where I was going with
that to the there is just so much fun I

577
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,098
just kept pumping for information and
when we got there is number anyway

578
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,880
didn't give him a call later on and on
you know you giving out some I've home

579
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,789
phone number that cell phone number to a
complete stranger

580
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:20,759
just because they ask you to because she
had some spare it ensures people take

581
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:24,049
to keep urself giving out the social
security number people are able to do

582
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,799
things like that very easily if I
convinced

583
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:30,460
are many is the time when I'm anytime
but at least a few times

584
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,880
I I've done things like I in college

585
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,109
I calling students and saying can you
give us your student ID number not this

586
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,589
was gonna miss 219 number

587
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:44,538
the same number and if you ask my for
the social security number that they'll

588
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:49,190
you know flag goes up and I but student
ID okay that sounds official and

589
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,410
become think that the same number in the
first place are

590
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,680
what I was actually in the Bronx NY the
west coast to be any different than that

591
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,808
because they might still be

592
00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:00,509
they might still be open and have a
manager there before 28 okay with

593
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,730
somebody tell a quick story of my
something on the west coast

594
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,599
it's also easier social engineer people
that a

595
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,489
not calling him it's also easier social
is your people that's that

596
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:16,910
that's that does not a language barrier
with itself i woulda given up a lot

597
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,828
sooner

598
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:20,960
in but was a language barrier to an
attitude barrier

599
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,249
speaking over so a

600
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:27,849
language barriers this is sort of a
language barrier trick the people have

601
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:28,559
been using our

602
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,809
albeit for a lot of fraudulent purposes
said %uh

603
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:36,349
most companies maintain a special phone
line for a hearing impaired collars

604
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:39,420
I so you can use ATT de or TTY

605
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,480
on which you can there some computer
shopper musical emulated DVD or TV by

606
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,920
recon by them

607
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,700
look at flea markets for like twenty
dollars and look what I get to talk

608
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,900
about this is the first ok a little
keyboard in

609
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,400
because the couple earn will
alphanumeric display in a sense that

610
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,220
a great utility type saw mister signals
like that it it it it it

611
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,480
anyway so you can call a corporate
office for

612
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,259
that has the their ttttt guy one number
and not deal directly reach a person

613
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:09,099
and down they kinda feel sorry for you
because you have an impairment

614
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:13,200
and you can ask them almost anything and
they walk

615
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,730
it that you get away with any suspicious
inflection in your voice is completely

616
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,210
in a minute eliminated

617
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,880
on and but it's sort of like a lot it's
kinda like typing back and forth a

618
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,690
and him you know in a chat room or
something but it's a it's greasy TTY so

619
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,049
that's

620
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,069
one method I've I've used to contact
companies and get

621
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:33,619
get things get them to do things you
could not possibly even the Dubai

622
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:34,420
talking to the

623
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,670
the normal front-line people %uh the
just

624
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:42,499
use the spoken voice so just know the
trick microphone to

625
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:46,849
work because we're about ok arm

626
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,339
if you want to get on social security
number through in foreign stock picks

627
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:53,400
the best way to do it is what they call
the

628
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,910
scarcely behavior principal and that is
where

629
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,808
you frame the question where the target
if they don't comply with the request

630
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:02,920
for gonna lose something

631
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,509
so if Eric wanted to get the target
social security number to been better

632
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:11,609
to say that he is with the payroll with
BP and there's been a problem processing

633
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:12,960
the payroll check

634
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,489
had last she gives up hit the social
security number she will not get paid

635
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,480
thereby suffering a loss and that is a
strong influence tactic

636
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,910
for the target to comply with a request
so they will suffer the loss

637
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:31,910
good point fat people will do more

638
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,640
well comply more with a

639
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,390
with doing an action to avoid a lost and
actually realize the game

640
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,089
there's been some social studies on this
topic a

641
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,529
and a guy named robert l be need to read
a book in florence has covered this if

642
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:47,220
you're interested

643
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,299
alright I i'm following the advice for
people here and across something on the

644
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,170
west coast

645
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,509
arm Seattle okay

646
00:39:55,509 --> 00:40:00,670
Federer I haven't called us yet so we
don't know for sure it's open but astrid

647
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:05,640
bad

648
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,670
I

649
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:16,670
up

650
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:25,819
p p

651
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,769
think it's a fax machine are just went
with this country

652
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:44,160
third Tokyo

653
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,328
third

654
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:52,500
them

655
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,859
third yes this is working

656
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:01,710
really striking out today not his fault
he's reaching run bad numbers

657
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,369
with this guy from home bad number you
say

658
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:08,390
senator tax cuts a fax machine

659
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,950
just faxed request I was just because

660
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,150
just because you're on the west coast as
mean they're open either

661
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,080
arm what I can do is call some

662
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,920
while somebody else tell the story and
and simply call that one back

663
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,470
1070 view this story in this story yet
another story for kevin Mitnick

664
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,860
time for nothing so here's a good one

665
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,530
on my autobiography is being published
next year by Little Brown

666
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,840
in this is a story I have been told but
that's gonna be in the book so it's kind

667
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,420
of like a

668
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,480
a like a view into some the social
engineering and tech sided

669
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,660
but remember I had federal I got source
code but one thing I was lacking was the

670
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,810
compiler

671
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:55,299
text to compile the code so my next
target was this company called

672
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,870
intra metrics which was based on a
Massachusetts

673
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,380
here and I was able to get in 10 for
metrics and it was a

674
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,860
I'm using a technical export to get into
their actual network

675
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,600
and so the object was a stupid look into
that look at their network lookup

676
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,830
where their workstations and servers
were actually find the source code

677
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,000
product releases for the sixty-eight

678
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,840
HC 11 ship that was on the phone itself
so

679
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,340
I looked around and the first thing I
did was go to the domain and look at the

680
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,170
at the aliases file because what they do
is they up

681
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,240
back in those days he would actually
have departments and individuals and you

682
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:31,580
can cook

683
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,940
usually work out who had access to
information

684
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,160
and through the aliases file I found

685
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,339
in Engineering Group analyst up into
tears really easy

686
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,080
and then so better work stations were
compromised

687
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,470
and the problem was I couldn't find the
compiler

688
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,020
a confined the source code I confine the
binaries that released to the market

689
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,759
but I did find a script in the script in
one of the engineers

690
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,870
directories was called make product well
actually make broad

691
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,140
and actually had the locations on the
network for all the

692
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,900
you know to build the source code where
their product releases were and when I

693
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,180
went to those machines nothing was there

694
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,799
so now it was time for a little bit a
social engineering your

695
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,130
the LES a file I found an about their
sales group and one other cell when

696
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,300
their sales offices were in washington
was in Washington DC

697
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,490
in already know who the engineers were
so

698
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:27,630
I called upon to lead engineers this guy
named Marty and I

699
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,970
said I was a David Burton over the
Washington DC office I'm a sales

700
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,700
engineer

701
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:37,440
for CSP goes you know I know what office
are you a night on the office yes we do

702
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,390
I work for a total I work for

703
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:45,350
and peco's a I'm I told the problem is
that I have a a sales meeting tomorrow

704
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,170
I have an older version of the eight 868
c11 compiler

705
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:53,320
and I want to show our the potential
client the newest release

706
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,670
he goes well you know you guys can keep
a secret

707
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:02,660
on of course I can keep a secret egos

708
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,770
listen he goes the reason can't find
anything as we got a call from the FBI

709
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,750
white yeah we got a call from the FBI
mice

710
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:16,990
Los Angeles apparently this super hacker
is going to break into our systems to

711
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:20,390
get there to %uh get our compiler
because he happened the Motorola

712
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,299
and the FBI had said that was as next
logical step

713
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:31,300
for

714
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,140
so I told my day said you have to be
kidding I mean come on I I really don't

715
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,720
have time to joke around i mean

716
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,349
I revisit I'll be really what why isn't
the code out there

717
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,930
he goes no seriously goes this guy
hacked into the CIA

718
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,649
he got level 3 access I mean there's a
manhunt for this guy

719
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,940
and I go what's this guys name because

720
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,510
I have no idea I said Wow I go

721
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,579
II didn't hear anything about it I said
but

722
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:04,980
I'm believe me I'll keep it a secret I
promise I won't tell anybody

723
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,099
and

724
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,190
I'm I said you know I still have a
problem Rd

725
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,690
because it wouldn't have a promise that
I have a sales meeting tomorrow I need

726
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:19,200
to show the client delete this compiler
us we could lose the deal

727
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,660
lose revenue he says alright

728
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,609
this is what I can do I could upload the
compiler to my workstation

729
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:30,410
I'll let you grab the copy and in all
remove it from my workstation

730
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:35,279
I said you know my eye so this is a
great idea

731
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,310
in fact when I copy it over all actually
remove it to my work to put it on

732
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,819
removable media so it's not even on my
workstation

733
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:48,819
you there is not a good idea he says yes
swear by the toes workstation I copy it

734
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,260
and of course higher removed by sending
it over to a system over in Colorado

735
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,400
and I don't think Martino's to this day
that he was actually speaking to the

736
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,020
hacker

737
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:07,020
we'll find out what he reads the book

738
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,029
but I was actually really surprised that
the FBI actually thought one step ahead

739
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:18,180
to me about moment

740
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:24,759
but thanks to Marty I found a pretty
quickly okay after a while you know when

741
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,390
it's time to give up

742
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,250
and I have not yet reached that time but
its common million I

743
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,230
I tried a bunch more in Seattle none of
them answered on what's going on out

744
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,660
there

745
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,740
but I did find another one in the Bronx
a dancer so with your permission I'll

746
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,960
try another one

747
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,190
up north alright on ok an attitude I ran
into this time but we'll give it a shot

748
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:44,500
I'll

749
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:51,500
I'll try different tactic this time the
ESM information I

750
00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:04,299
p in

751
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,710
yeah i three over it arise are having
trouble finding your location

752
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,720
to me you know how to get there yeah I
love the fishes

753
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,170
for each one wanted sisters see Braun

754
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:21,910
you ask 10 45 okay but what is the
trouble that your habits are

755
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,269
scar time I

756
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:28,730
not the that sure because I am here

757
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,289
the man is left already so what some

over the years can used right

820
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,720

827
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,230
two goals he is a man he to to

828
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:16,190
to start the repair was you you need to
go into the office right

829
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:19,670
right yes it was somebody in the office
correct via like the

830
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:24,599
the night there won't be anybody are you

831
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,630

832
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,849
no by that is I of this is a pretty

833
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:35,240
love plays a minor Jim now I am

834
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,930
Here I am working partner

835
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,410
that's why I could be effectively safe
for use in all because you don't have

836
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,109
the key

837
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:48,200
yeah I how the key but I'll leave from
here you don't look too D

838
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,329
okay I it's currently five to 10
software that if we have somebody there

839
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:55,839
by 10:30 would you be able to get to the
office of site

840
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:01,009
tomorrow or when I it will be tonight if
we're there by 10:30 would you be able

841
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,200
to get to the office

842
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,530
all to to 1030 what then

843
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:09,810
how long they will think the it's really
just a check

844
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:13,910
so line to see if it's a it's got a
condition on it it should take a longer

845
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,598
than 5-10 minutes to max

846
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,930
then it would be fine because two more I
need to try order the two fastballs

phone for another half hour

864
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:32,220
but here's the thing I just I just made
it okay to come by his station with an

865
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,490
unmarked vehicle and go into his office

866
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:38,530
just because I called on the phone I
mean that's that's right how we think

867
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,000
about

868
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,630
too much information throughout for
somebody to actually do that tonight but

869
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:45,730
but you're going to do that but it's an
because he leaves in an hour

870
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,510
from

871
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:52,680
that's the best I can do we only have a
few minutes left so any

872
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:58,110
closing comments we have to keep the
schedule in her story everyone to vote

873
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:58,710
okay

874
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,950
I know when I could cry know when I call
him because

875
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,140
for small his numbers already been given
out he's getting a phone call from that

876
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,009
woman at the gas station right now is

877
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:11,840
showing is here offer something I and
dilly was his name right Gilliam Billy

878
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,120
for believe I whatever I'm still Mike
and I didn't write that is Numbers ICANN

879
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:15,850
column

880
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:20,120
color back that's the thing you know
that don't keep more information than

881
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,040
you need to keep

882
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,290
because I can they can be a hindrance at
times and also know how to back out

883
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,770
gracefully said people don't call the
cops and things

884
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,930
are you finding a are you finding a

885
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:34,420
when you make calls like this the to
over the past few years

886
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,750
a front-line people you normally have to
deal with on

887
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,710
are typically not native English
speakers in it and at the same problems

888
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,530
we have getting our tech support or
something talk to people like this

889
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:48,020
on its it's often difficult you were a

890
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,050
social engineer them just because
there's a language barrier he found out

891
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:54,500
that change the way you are you present
yourself and as a present an opportunity

892
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,210
them to a definite that opportunities
everything presents an opportunity

893
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,300
and effect you can call yourself as
somebody who doesn't speak English and

894
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,870
people tell you more because

895
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,850
the try to get off the phone and they're
trying to explain things slowly and

896
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,460
loudly

897
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,250
and they'll just a they'll read all
kinds of things of you that normally

898
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,760
they would hurry to somebody who spoke
at their

899
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,760
level love a try language and

900
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,090
yeah I've minute I movement or get
information that way to spy

901
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:22,710
speaking with a a crazy accent or
pretending that we don't understand what

902
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,000
they're talking about so those

903
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,740
keep feeding information to get rid of
us aniya

904
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,950
me last comments said absolutely
unbelievable how many places and things

905
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:35,980

either many times are up got in the

907
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,800

saves for opened I mean

909
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,840
