1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,139
it %uh how many people in Europe
volunteered at some point throughout the

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:03,889
conference

3
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:07,080
alright I just wanna let you guys know
that

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,460
there are a lot of people who have made
their 10 our commitments on

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,500
you have not yet picked up their
t-shirts and so

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,800
a lot of you a lot of all in tears are
really really close

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,930
and if you haven't volunteered just like
Greg said we have a really big need

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,400
for tear down today and tomorrow even if
you have to take off you can do little

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,010
things

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,910
if you see a little cop or a bottle or
some piece of trash ur shares that are

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,130
right you can help cleanup and help make
tear down a much easier process by doing

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,590
your little part and if you can

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,500
stick around for as long as you can to
help us get everything done so that

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,149
guys like me you haven't really slept in
3-4 days

15
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:48,450

just on that note give a huge round of

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,100
applause for the volunteers have been
working so so hard to bring the CEO

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:59,100
with literally without them

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,600
that with a conference like this could
not be possible um also ever

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
couple of other announcements someone

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,740
I was gone

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,740
okay by Greg thank you Greg maybe
everybody are out we have a a cup more

28
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,340
people that will be showing up on stage
but

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,750
this is enough to start off with right
now are this talk is a is called

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,790
informants villains or

31
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,810
heroes are and we all

32
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,330
we all have stories in our lives as to
how

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,640
informants have a have played a part

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,920
one way or another arm minibus

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,920
our informant serving again I don't the
thing is in the hacker world

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,550
the odds are was a one and four one in
five

37
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,150
the if it's ridiculous percentage but
the number of people who become

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,400
informants or

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,690
or are working for two different sides
at the same time is extraordinarily

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,510
Heinz's

41
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,790
always been the case from the very
beginning back in the nineteen

42
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,910
sixties and seventies with phone phreaks
you could bet that

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,340
one in a handful people would be reading
their friends out

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,390
and the question that I think we need to
ask it today is why do people do this

45
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,610
why does this happen what what gets into
someone's head with their

46
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,560
do something like this and what would
you do in a similar situation

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,580
and can you judge somebody that you have
not been in their shoes

48
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,610
a very quickly I'll tell my story and
then

49
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,930
these two tho there's are back when

50
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,540
I got into trouble in the in the
mid-eighties arm

51
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,429
hacking into nasa and White House
various other things

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,900
fired GTE stone that system arm the
unfortunate

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,239
aftermath of that was that that federal
agents descended

54
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,970
on now the radio station at work at at
the State University of New York at

55
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,790
Stony per

56
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,489
and that cause all cause all kinda
confusion because I will first of all I

57
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:31,880
didn't

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,890
own a computer at the time I so

59
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,970
I was it seemed to be a suspect right
actually tell

60
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,209
the federal authorities who the suspect
was it wasn't the guy on the computer as

61
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,590
a guy was actually using the computer if
so why

62
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,660
you know send your subpoena is this way
on after that happened i knows people

63
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,170
start acting kinda strange because when
federal

64
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,230
agents are lurking about on people get
scared people have all kinds of fun

65
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,970
unpredictable reactions and the thing I
notice must a first all about people

66
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,030
stop talking to me

67
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,390
at and I guess that's something that
that happens whenever you're under

68
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,970
investigation by some kind of

69
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,200
law enforcement agency people kinda
freak out and they say I know I don't be

70
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,850
seen with him cuz I could be busted for
something else or

71
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,890
guilt by association what not on so
there are those people who stopped

72
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,950
talking to me but then

73
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,670
there was one person that I found out
later because

74
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,450
other people did not keep their mouth
shut I found out that this guy

75
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:32,180
had gone to the University legal people
and volunteered information

76
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,660
volunteered things that that he had
heard me say

77
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,410
that might make me some white there
suspect maybe I'm up to something more

78
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,870
because a federal authorities were very
interested in

79
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,120
who I was what I was doing and at the
time I was

80
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,700
iris I was floored how could somebody do
this why would somebody

81
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,560
who's not under investigation themselves
voluntarily go to somebody

82
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,980
and turn in evidence or what they think
is evidence or suspicion or gossip or

83
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,770
whatever

84
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,099
are without any reason to me we were
friends with this is somebody I talked

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,690
is money I saw every day

86
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,460
and again the only reason I found out
was because some idiot and university

87
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,020
office

88
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,830
told somebody else and I got back to me
and yeah I was irish pissed off as hell

89
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,270
in this happened because

90
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,599
that this guy screwing me over for no
reason never do anything to him

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,700
and cycle which had now I mean I was
very open about what I did I i

92
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,700
even went to the feds and told them so
that somebody else wouldn't get in

93
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,350
trouble for it

94
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,330
and here are people looking to make it
even worse are

95
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,840
it was very very hard for me to
understand this at the time afterwards

96
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,160
I tried I I tried hard to to put myself
in their shoes

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,270
and understand what they must have been
thinking

98
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,430
when they did this and how scare
somebody can be just at the site of a

99
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,990
cop

100
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,040
at the site or a federal agent and who
knows what the means they have working

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,500
in their closet

102
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,470
people panic people panic and do things
that we don't understand why they do it

103
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,650
and the authorities count on this the
authorities

104
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,640
live for this kind of thing so that they
get as much information to get

105
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,940
all of us telling other people about

106
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,100
other people this is however
authoritarian government

107
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,460
in history has worked by getting their
citizens to spy on each other and report

108
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,590
to the authorities

109
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,260
and then more people do it to them on so
without the dialogue that's why I hope

110
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,370
we accomplish here today the dialogue
where we actually try and understand

111
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,650
we're all coming from maybe we can
prevent this kind of thing from

112
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,420
continuing to happen but

113
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,910
right now and that you'll hear some
stories today

114
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,620
this is a part of our community that has
always been there

115
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,490
the amount of people who turn into
informants the america people who turn

116
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,600
people in

117
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,840
are there aren't many people do you
think you can trust with information

118
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,440
that you really can't

119
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,860
on that is that has always been with us
and I likely will be for

120
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,950
for quite some time from Kevin what you
have

121
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,000
yeah I i'm I had issues with the

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,270
informants as well and for feudal issues
your

123
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,760
on for small the the way the federal
authorities work to is absurd divide and

124
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,690
conquer

125
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,780
so what they want to do is if they could
find

126
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,170
more than one person involved in the
case

127
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,060
what the old what i'll do is i'll try to
turn the other person to what they call

128
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,380
a cooperator

129
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,830
so and the benefit of that obviously is
the person gets a reduced sentence

130
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,219
or under the federal sentencing
guidelines they get

131
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,480
what they call acceptance of
responsibility so what

132
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,920
so in essence what the informant or the
snitches actually

133
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,540
getting paid with what you know not
money

134
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,030
but less time in exchange for their
testimony

135
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,360
which I have a problem with because

136
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,200
if a jury found out that something was
paid ten thousand dollars to testify

137
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,880
or they were paid with one year less and
present to me it's the same

138
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,350
so they actually get paid for their
testimony my personal experience

139
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,210
when I first hacked in this is right out
of high school I was 17 years old

140
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,610
arm hi a became involved with this group
of guys

141
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,790
and the new much more about the risk to
see operating system in fact they

142
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,960
actually were the administrators to the
system for the Los Angeles Unified

143
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,420
School District

144
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,510
another time I was on the phone freaking
I didn't really care

145
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,450
much about hacking I was more very
however very

146
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,789
passionate feeling towards telephony

147
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,510
and I wanted to join this group

148
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,559
so what they did is they have their
initiation was like an impossible task

149
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,740
the had a cop a colleague that actually
work for digital equipment corporation

150
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,159
onerous to see development team

151
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,350
and they told me to permit dept for me
to be able to join their group I had a

152
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,200
break interest to see development attack

153
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,920
and I said well how can I do that we're
going to give you the dial-up number

154
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,290
so they gave me the dialup number and

155
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,560
at the time you know the only thing you
could do is either guest password for

156
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,910
your social engineering at that point so

157
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,920
actually social engineering I was able
to get in and

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,240
then what these guys as they immediately
went down to

159
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,329
an office that actually at faster modems
you know by

160
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:16,019
1200 baud because back then where the
110 300 bod

161
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,130
stay right down to their office 1200
baud and they're actually copping the

162
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,459
source code

163
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:25,810
to the wrist to see operating system and
I was kinda watching them do this

164
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,700
and then we found out later after the
finish this task

165
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,019
they actually called it early couldn't
corporation and told them I'm the one

166
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,850
that had been

167
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,040
after the smaller source code
fortunately

168
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,420
I was a juvenile at the time and nothing
a

169
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,849
nothing actually happened to me I was
never approached by the authorities

170
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,920
but later on in life I E I'm I'd chose
bad happened partners

171
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,469
and there was a guy funny money to see
go

172
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,690
and he and I a we've had contest against
each other

173
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,240
so I worked at a company he worked at a
company

174
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,649
and we have a challenge if we could hack
into other each other systems like

175
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,670
trying to capture the flag

176
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,920
we would your %uh the reward would be
200 bucks

177
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,469
so I kept getting into his system at
work but he could never get into mine

178
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,029
he got Henry and then one time it and
then it

179
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,040
ended up becoming a situation where

180
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,310
he actually went to the I did some
pranks because

181
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,160
arm a we have a little falling out over
this

182
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,839
and he actually went to the FBI and told
them

183
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,160
all the happy we're doing in Digital
Equipment Corporation cuz at that time

184
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,680
were

185
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,639
copping the VM a source code so here's a
guy that was me even

186
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,899
under investigation or anything at that
point

187
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,860
and because he was angry with me went to
the federal authorities

188
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,550
and became an informant but because he
didn't have a lawyer

189
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,019
or discuss us with an attorney what had
happened is he actually ended up getting

190
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,910
himself convicted of a felony

191
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,490
yeah which is really stupid he wasn't
just so angry he

192
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,509
you know you ended up now has a felony
on his record

193
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:09,519
so then later on now that I got involved
with the another

194
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,300
another guy and he was in the future the
game I you probably have

195
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,410
for the those other for the book there's
a guy named Luis the pain

196
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,819
he and I were packing partners for over
20 years

197
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:24,339
and but that the putative a game because
John let me in

198
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,300
got input from him not really the
authorities

199
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,110
up when they went in search to his
apartment

200
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,120
in the book it's per trade as he hair
was a

201
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
one up on the FBI that he was a a

202
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,540
a not being cooperative at all and he
was a

203
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,019
being antagonistic in that he knew all
about their operation

204
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,499
which you know a lot about their
operation but

205
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:53,540
in the book it appeared he was like
non-cooperative in a smart ass to the

206
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,439
government

207
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:58,829
but in reality when I got my discovery
what they call FBI 30 to use

208
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:04,620
this is way in somebody interviews with
an FBI agent the fill out these FBI 302

209
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,129
forms and I got that in my

210
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:10,050
a pre-trial discovery after four years
by the way

211
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,249
I found out that that really wasn't the
case that was

212
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:17,079
that soon as they got into searched his
apartment

213
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,199
he immediately offered cooperation if

214
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,829
the government for providing protection
what i was gonna do something

215
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,649
but I'm a so for

216
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,160
in all my cases except for the a last
witness a time machine tomorrow

217
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,550
they all involved informants arm

218
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,509
and in one case it was a guy that was
had a vendetta against me the second

219
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,459
case was

220
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,629
a guy who was under investigation with
me

221
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:48,889
arm myself when I was going winners

222
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,480
city in custody there was the free Kevin
movement

223
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
I was offered to cooperate you know
because what happens is how the

224
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,180
government

225
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,889
wants to work the cases as they want
somebody

226
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:04,100
to be able to testify against the other
and they want to divide and conquer both

227
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,569
you know all the parties in the
conspiracy but at the time I refuse to

228
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:08,969
cooperate because I've

229
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,279
felt it was against my ethics and moral
fiber

230
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,709
to reduce my sentence to hand it off to
somebody else

231
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:22,709
I just felt really uncomfortable

232
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,420
so i sat in prison much longer than I
normally would if I would've had cut

233
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,139
I had to cooperate but I feel good today
knowing

234
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,740
that I didn't hurt somebody else I
didn't write a to reduce my sentenced to

235
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,889
harm another individual and that even
got to the point where the government

236
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,499
said okay you don't have a corporate
against somebody else but we want to

237
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:44,559
debrief year

238
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,420
and I even refused to allow the
government to debrief me so

239
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,199
what ended up happening as I actually
served out like before something citing

240
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:52,550
get

241
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,230
any points for acceptance of
responsibility or anything about sort

242
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,809
but what I think what's also interesting
there's a way to detect foreman's in the

243
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,249
federal system

244
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:06,490
there's a computer system call P sir

245
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,199
public access to court electronic
records and this allows you to look up

246
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,300
dockets the doctor reports the people
that have been charged with federal

247
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,079
crimes

248
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,119
also several your bankruptcy there so

249
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:21,360
you know we have a system works because
I was inside the system for quite some

250
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,279
time

251
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,579
I could look at a docket and

252
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,769
kinda get a good sense of whether that
person is cooperating against and other

253
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,800
individual

254
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,850
and look lookbooks look up an example
I'm not saying this particular person's

255
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,379
informant but there's %uh its highly
suspicious

256
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,600
some other circumstances in their
dockets let's take a quick look

257
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,269
you bring it up on projector

258
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,769
bring up said under

259
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,610
this is somebody is in prison them no
okay

260
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,839
I was meaning shank because it's
something we say were

261
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,369
where a governor runner

262
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:06,860
are so here's there's a doctor report of
peace or anybody could sign up for pacer

263
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,329
analyzes things

264
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,860
so I just picked up just a random guy
this guy

265
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,600
those guys named Gregory B evidence okay

266
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,619
and and let's look at analyze the docket
here what does it mean terminated

267
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,029
that means the cases it doesn't mean
he's terminated means they the

268
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,199
face was I don't know the National I

269
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,480
if other problems were that easy so this
is the case for the Central District of

270
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,459
California now

271
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,879
let's look at some like suspicious
things you could see in a docket

272
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,679
first of all we see that this individual
sentenced to 24 months

273
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,559
on the right hand side under the
disposition but let's go down

274
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,860
now in the news media report actually
Google this guy I'm and this guy

275
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,540
actually had a codefendant

276
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,089
what suspicious as the codefendants not
on the same docket

277
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,220
enough normal federal case will be
prosecuted individual

278
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,670
they have to try them together for part
of the same conspiracy

279
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,029
so they're not on the same docid: that
means or something

280
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,660
is strange is going on but let's look
further because that's not a conclusive

281
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,550
by itself

282
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,779
so if we look at we look that he was
charged with information and these are

283
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:12,869
numbered

284
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:17,550
a and I'll go for the numbers 1 he was
charged with a minute information

285
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,699
then he was indicted a number for

286
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,759
okay he was assigned to this judgment
picture VZN

287
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,329
okay in number eight the government

288
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:32,360
all requested the tension with that
means is they wanna hold this person

289
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,879
without bail

290
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,860
okay because they're either our flight
risk or danger to the community

291
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,959
so if we go down a little bird a bit
further

292
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,339
the number nine he immediately decided
to plead guilty

293
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,910
that means there's no presumption have
evidence that he is actually guilty

294
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,879
love some other charges in the
indictment or the information

295
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,949
so then we go down a little further

296
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,579
and if you look at number 17 there's a
noticeable filing under seal

297
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:04,280
by his attorney meaning that this is not
for public consumption

298
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,339
and it so I him the government can
obviously see it

299
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,099
but it's a notice filed under seal and
immediately after this

300
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,209
under seal filing ok and their server
love them

301
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,000
he number 28 of a sudden he's gotten
bail

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,140
they're allowing them to bond out a
prison no

303
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,890
but doesn't make sense if there if
you're if if we if you haven't been

304
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,030
found guilty by a truck trailer pled
guilty

305
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,360
right the government didn't want him out

306
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,429
they basically want to Tina now now the
guy pleads guilty

307
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,850
there several in undersea of islands of
a sudden he's getting bail

308
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,610
I mean what do you think now it's not
conclusive

309
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,940
so there's this security users the
property he said putting up

310
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,570
and now if you look at 33 Thomas whole
list

311
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,750
that's all under in camera under seal in
filings by the defense

312
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,970
right so usually what this is

313
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,980
I'm not sure in this particular guys
case but in a lotta cases

314
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,550
its way in the attorney you know there'd
they're talking about the cooperation

315
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,790
that person is doing with the government
so

316
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,830
another thing to look for is long delays
after pleading guilty or been if

317
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,760
well pleading guilty before that in
sentencing if there is a lot but many

318
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,920
several months in between it's usually
normally ninety days

319
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,480
has in a federal criminal case they have
to do the print the US Probation Office

320
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,890
has to do with the call pre-sentence
report

321
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,640
the pre-sentence report the the
probation department recommends a

322
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
sentence

323
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,559
that's a ninety-day period but when it
goes on for months

324
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,860
what that means well could likely mean
look at all the other is under seal

325
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,790
filings

326
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,210
what that means is there's a reason why
there's a late delay between

327
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,880
adjudication of guilt in sentencing and
that usually indicates

328
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,580
that that person maybe be cooperating
against another defendant

329
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,939
or more than one defender so it's kind
of interesting because

330
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,130
in my personal case I don't know if you
know this is a guy

331
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,360
a in Justin Turner Petersen who went
under the name of the agent steel

332
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,039
and what this guy was doing is he was
actually

333
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,019
arm committing credit card frauds

334
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,740
and he was involved in the Kevin Poulsen
case he ran off to Texas

335
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,789
he got busted again for fraud as soon as
the end up in jail

336
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,820
he calls Pacific Bell in the FBI in Los
Angeles on offers

337
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,668
to become are informant against the
hacker community

338
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:35,299
and his job was to get

339
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,049
the bust or two acquire evidence against
as many

340
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:43,750
people as he possibly can and I became
one of the hot the large targets

341
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,980
after he was able to

342
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,649
help the government that Kevin Paulson's
computer in the prosecution against

343
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,760
Kevin Poulsen

344
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,970
his next target was made so if you look
at his docid:

345
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,860
on pacer it very a essentially has the
same pattern of numerous under seal

346
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,909
filings by the defense

347
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:07,500
bonding out after pleaded guilty

348
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,640
long delays between adjudication guilt
and something

349
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,470
she could kind of workout just by trip
like i neva traffic analysis was an

350
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,299
informant or not so I think that's quite
interesting

351
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,760
arm on what else to say you know i i had

352
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,330
issues with people in for me against me
and several instances

353
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,110
by never became informant against people
in

354
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,169
in life federal cases because I can I
felt that that was the wrong thing to do

355
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,760
and a I think in some cases you have to
look to what the person is doing if you

356
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,309
knew your next door neighbor

357
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,059
with killing children and bearing in the
backyard would you informed consent

358
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:45,950
person

359
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,039
probably right you know somebody's
killing people right

360
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,210
but I think if there's a blueprint okay
yeah probably

361
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,929
like for sure yeah so um

362
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:03,260
so I mean you gotta look at what what
what what is that person really doing

363
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,080
figures a very subjective arm and then
how do you handle it if

364
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,760
you going in form against the the a
serial killer neighbor

365
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,919
and you go off in your intention is just
to do it too

366
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,149
for example read about

367
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:22,769
read about the situation in the media or
something like that maybe that's the

368
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:23,929
wrong reason

369
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:27,539
maybe if the reason was really to
protect other kids from being victimized

370
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,658
by this fictitious serial killer

371
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:33,630
you know maybe that's a better reason
are one of the best reasons

372
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,090
you know maybe is if you have to protect
yourself

373
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,889
for example if I were to come to you for
example admit that I just are

374
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,990
rob the bank across the street
technically

375
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,919
if the government found out that I told
you when you had knowledge about your

376
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,860
what they called the Caesarea after the
fact or miss prissy and have a felony I

377
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,769
miss prison to a felony which means you
could be prosecuted and sentenced

378
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:58,990
big the for the same behavior as

379
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,320
the what you attempted to conceal K so
their head the program under bridge we

380
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,510
have a lot of ground to cover we

381
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,580
we have a 90-minute panel today which is
great but we we have so much the cover

382
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,789
is when people talk to

383
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:11,870
are just joining us this fiber optic
from the mayor member am

384
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:17,070
in well

385
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,240
and there's there's more coming to are
but right now I burn a few briefly

386
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,769
a give for some slide presentation here

387
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:27,840
keep moving what's there

388
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,449
oh that's a year as part of a federal
government call the United States

389
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,019
sensing

390
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,889
Commission and they and they come up
with that are deciding how long people

391
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:36,769
should

392
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,230
be locked up for various deeds and

393
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,419
davis's of broken and a formula said
it's amazing

394
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:47,880
what infrastructure we have for this
very thing but there's a sense in cable

395
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,070
and a if you look at further down you'll
see

396
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,059
that well along the vertical axis at the
sense in Table you see a

397
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,690
base offense level which is a ice a
number from 1 up to

398
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,519
goes up to like forty-three and Anna up
on them

399
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,159
horizontal axis is a chart is a criminal
history score

400
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:10,820
depending on your your prior offenses
for the misdemeanors felonies thats

401
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,039
scored as well and where they intersect
is a arrange

402
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,629
a month that the federal government will
put you in prison you can see

403
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,750
the low end its like zero to six months
and then at the year

404
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,950
the high and you have a on

405
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,250
you know 210 to 250 two months or

406
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,260
no when the lower right hand corner you
see a bunch of things

407
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,690
have letters in them like 360 months

408
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,090
which like thirty years two were dash

409
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,529
l.i.f.e 30 life on I

410
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:44,620
I spend on a budget I'm US Marshals
custody while waiting for

411
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,070
good court hearings in federal building
Philadelphia guys to come back from

412
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,418
their trials whatever

413
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:53,200
and you know every ask for what you get
and the combat I got letters

414
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,870
and now that meant yeah young guy you're
talking to 20 years old need foundations

415
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,450
and rest life in prison for

416
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,659
whatever you don't have to with the
Gator accused of

417
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:05,840
it's not too late not bad form but the
the

418
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,399
its has an impact on you just just meet
a young person just said they got

419
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:10,360
letters

420
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,220
so anyway this is what the federal
government to hand out to people

421
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,000
and when people who are facing the sort
of thing

422
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
your what you think you normally would
do in a situation

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,380
sometimes goes out the window on so

424
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,580
that's the sensing guidelines on when
people are facing their

425
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,139
they also on sometimes will get which
called me

426
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,240
proffer letter the federal government
will ever

427
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,350
adjusting appear on central later

428
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,690
saying K we're

429
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,289
week maybe not have a charger yet but in
your personal interest

430
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:49,470
and if you tell us some information here
a

431
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,600
we will give you a very kind of immunity
so that you won't get prosecuted for

432
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,659
things Longleat house that everything

433
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:59,620
and if someone's looking at letters or
or in smaller numbers but significant

434
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,639
numbers

435
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:04,659
locked in a cage you might consider
doing then I'm not suggesting that but

436
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:06,950
I'm just saying that's kinda pressure
people can be under

437
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,639
here's a copy of the a proper later from
the Department justice to somebody had

438
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:12,049
to switch when I

439
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:17,120
found random ago on and I also wanted to
show

440
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,309
on what the federal government

441
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:25,110
a there's any with your second

442
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:30,630
there's a I'm 1.1

443
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,970
year ago downward departures in the
federal sentencing

444
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,049
up I call this fall the part in the
informant infrastructure

445
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:42,179
other government our country you see
something called a

446
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,549
substantial assistance to authorities or
5k 1.1

447
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:51,539
and basically it says and go and all
other

448
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,440
details here you can look at 5k 1.1
under US St United States and some

449
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,059
guidelines

450
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,139
basically it says that you're a your
fans will be less often considerably

451
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:00,940
less

452
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,889
if you provide substantial assistance to
authorities

453
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:09,429
on in my own case or cases I had a state
miscommunication that a federal felony

454
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:10,370
case

455
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,450
on and their shirt they were tied
together on

tampering with evidence and that was a

457
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,389
allegedly your removing battery is from
a touchdown Tyler

with the disappearance of instruction

460

person I knew his friend came along

463
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,250
on and a the car was

464
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,539
for cars parked in a place that the
police like wonder why the scars from

465
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:48,200
the car to search for two curly

466
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,070
with police to search the car the guys
are super committee that was it was a

467
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,360
stolen car was in

468
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,460
but they searched through it may be
found they found a couple time dialers

469
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,500
in the car and they were like so the
neighbors like this what exists a

470
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,279
its investigation they take back the
police station when she came back to get

471
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,320
the car

472
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,360
and on wearin in holding area

473
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,860
waiting for them to decide but they were
gonna figure out charged with anything

474
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,330
and on that's when the batteries
disappeared from a 10 dialer and

475
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,158
instruction sheet also disappeared and
ironically

476
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,269
the tone dialer now in question it was
my cum Tyler

477
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:28,100
and a the instruction sheet was did not
go into Mike

478
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,029
underwear somebody else into um butter

479
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:35,700
i'ma national bout any that on but I was

480
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,269
for are unwilling to testify against
anyone else in

481
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:44,600
on I was person whose car was so they
charge me they said if you don't

482
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,159
even so would tell them was involved
with a standard be charged in a

483
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,960
they came up as a misdemeanor there was
gonna like the some pennsylvania

484
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,200
misdemeanor says if you possess
something that could be used to commit

485
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,789
to

486
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,059
telephone fraud than that said it's a
misdemeanor but say but they

487
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:03,250
can charge me with the they can prove it
to do that to the discharge me with that

488
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,980
tampering with evidence because I was
going to say what he did that he took

489
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,490
the batteries out but the church's cash
or check it might not fit in my car so I

490
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,549
took the charge

491
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:14,509
on ironically when they got by running
but when I got my friends

492
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:17,769
friend was a codefendant in by

493
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:21,570
fiber optics case I didn't know that at
the time opted to tell me he was under

494
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,750
probation parole or something so I
didn't want him to get in trouble

495
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,929
so on any case so that that friend

496
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,120
later turned out to be an informant yeah
I don't know I didn't know

497
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,799
I just knew he was tax guy but I didn't
know he was a significant

498
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,620
informant in this case that happen
actually before be informed on March

499
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,700
in marked for Ana 5 case before

500
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,659
this thing happened with me but I didn't
know that they were connected in any

501
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:45,340
case

502
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,480
on now you're so when Bynum than this
said

503
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,389
this thing the secret service came up
with me and to make a long story short

504
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:56,429
after I was arrested for

505
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,820
possessing hardware and software that
could be misused

506
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,970
Gordon government on for the on on
offers access to telecommunications

507
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,389
services

508
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:08,730
a newspaper article appeared in
philadelphia inquirer which

509
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,279
alerted someone who were I was here with
at the

510
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,669
very first tho conference who won you
know i win

511
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:19,610
I a deal were I would forget about a
quartz crystals you purchase a budget

512
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,789
really small town dialers and he's all
the time dollars in that and if this

513
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:23,408
room

514
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:26,799
and I feel crystals and inside the room
and then people built

515
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,970
red boxes these parts and

516
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,830
another page in history in hotel
Pennsylvania right in this room was like

517
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,000
right here

518
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,899
where we could have the stage right here
we had was like a big experience the

519
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:37,779
first her

520
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,799
but anyway solana crystals like a cost
like a dollar not just basically a

521
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,769
bicep community service to the for the
air and the community here but

522
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:49,480
in any case and many months later when
this article appeared the fire he saw

523
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,279
the free

524
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:54,210
down he called any what he was doing he
was actually building and selling red

525
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:54,769
boxes I

526
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,730
was never i'd never sold a red box
anybody was never charged for selling a

527
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,059
red box and everything we tried using
red box but

528
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,279
beside the point twenties on when he saw
that he freaked out

529
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,120
he called police and they said the
secret service involved with any call

530
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,210
the secret service

531
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,210
and and despite him having a

532
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,210
sold 100 boxes to by coworkers school
Philadelphia

533
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,799
public school teacher and sold in
dollars called workers that sort of

534
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,279
thing

535
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:21,830
despite that level of culpability the
Secret Service

536
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,649
who had certain motivation to work

537
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:28,970
punish me for things I had nothing to do
it on dollars had with the

538
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:33,779
just distributing on freeones voters are
some other undercover agents

539
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:37,179
this comes from Mike prosecutor told my
lawyer that this is the real reason I

540
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:38,490
was locked up in any case

541
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,500
they gave him enough they gave them
enough information to put

542
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,639
but a case together that's one thing one
when a government agency can

543
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:48,600
for one person age you can they can
figure out what's going on but they have

544
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,210
to prove it

545
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,610
you know and it it's helpful when they
have summoned to testify against you

546
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,389
that thats much stronger evidence they
can say well obviously he was doing this

547
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:57,879
news because he had this

548
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:02,120
so fun to do you think that person was
afraid of what they were doing

549
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,600
there was something red boxes he says so
they came forward so that they wouldn't

550
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,299
get in trouble

551
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,929
yes and and fingered you absolutely you
with the bigger anyway because you

552
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:13,440
actually teaching people things and
speaking out and being

553
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,450
about morality in just the common can I
was hiding this I was publicly

554
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,029
showing people your head a little red
boxes at first a conference on minute 25

555
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,960
had meetings

556
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,409
on and other stuff so on he

557
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:28,720
knowing that I was now locked up

558
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,289
was afraid that I was gonna rat him out
I was like that he said it's a

559
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,429
divide-and-conquer think people are
afraid he's gonna read who at first

560
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,899
so I I was just taking responsibility
for my own actions and I was not about

561
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,980
to maim anybody else even though I got
her partner letter later on

562
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,990
all this on take responsibility for my
actions

563
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,740
on but here he decided he wanted to work

564
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,490
relieve himself from a punishment and I
got an apology letter from him a year

565
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,610
later saying our

566
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,009
hope you can understand what I did I'm
sorry but you know I've got a wife and

567
00:31:58,009 --> 00:31:59,480
kids and a job in

568
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,389
and I hope you understand anyone on just
like small talk after letter Mike

569
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:06,970
with the how was this letter like psych
go away

570
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,179
Adam nothing to do with you work so on
these people receive it is justified

571
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,720
what we're going to do this

572
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,169
but on on as a result in doing that he
got

573
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,200
actually know he got complete immunity
even though his actions were

574
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,460
use more culpable in in on committing

575
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,009
criminal offenses that I was but he got
you get nothing

576
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:30,830
so on and aggression getting nothing but
I do have problem with

577
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,820
how year I did that if that result on

578
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,668
might see I just wanna make one more
point

579
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:42,960
victims oh yeah the federal government
and stable government both my phones

580
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,480
state misdemeanor in federal phone cases
in both cases at the wrist

581
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,990
the put in writing that there were no
victims in my fences

582
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,269
on yet yeah you can still

583
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:56,899
despite a vicuna case you can solve
spencer's time in prison

584
00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:01,279
you became a victim for well over a year
well money not technically victim but I

585
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:01,850
N

586
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,090
you know it's been good year and I went
through a lot of drama and so forth but

587
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,070
at

588
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,309
you know its kinda ironic you know
you're standing for judging and

589
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,320
apologize

590
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,620
typically expected apologized to judge
her the people you

591
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,889
armed and at I was like really short on
words

592
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:21,669
like what you do what you want to say
that governs

593
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:24,570
government said I do anything they don't
you guys don't hear that you know you

594
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,610
have to look humble and whatever has
sewer

595
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,370
and want to say on the victim but yet
whatever so this kinda stuff happens but

596
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,429
it's funnier

597
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:35,360

obliged to learn for our own protection
mom I want to take a a few moments to

606
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,540
rewind a little bit and speak on behalf
love

607
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,320
are our rules that we live by in our
community

608
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,790
long before the FBI and Secret Service
succeeded in

609
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,230
infiltrating our community om

610
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,230
probably these things probably aren't
spoken aloud very much anymore and at

611
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,379
the risk of sounding cliche I won't
refer to them as the hacker ethic

612
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,529
since that's become us something about a
bomb

613
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:39,790
above something in a movie script arm
what I will say is this is that on

614
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,440
we've always for spoken of the the quest
for knowledge is being most important in

615
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,860
our pursuits

616
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,990
that om this was a always a a noble
cause

617
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:55,290
nada the destruction up systems book
crashing systems was always a

618
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,279
something that we avoided doing at all
costs whether by accident were

619
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,900
on as a joke it was something that was
always frowned upon

620
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,750
om the job the fact that I information
on

621
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,840
about technology should be freely
available

622
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,300
obvious something that we always held to
be a fun

623
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,460
of great importance so we always frowned
upon companies who charged information

624
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,410
I'm sorry for charge money for a
technical documentation

625
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,509
information about operating systems
which was very hard to find

626
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,820
on in the nineteen eighties for example

627
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,870
arm which is why are trashing and things
of that nature

628
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:39,330
were so popular was a lot of the times
was to find manuals on how to use the

629
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,529
systems

630
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,730
on that that we were getting access to

631
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,880
om and then probably above all else

632
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,040
are there was the notion of trust I'm

633
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,849
which was extremely important when you
consider the fact that

634
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:59,240
are at those times I at that time there
wasn't any internet to speak up we were

635
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,640
communicating via bulletin boards

636
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,150
in most cases are bulletin board systems
into a single phone line with a single

637
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,040
modem

638
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,710
that we were sorry competing with each
other to get her busy signals

639
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,440
just getting read some messages and
respond to some messages

640
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,040
on is basically how we communicate with
each other om

641
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,290
back in the in the 1980s om

642
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:25,990
the things that we were doing wow a lot
of them originally were not illegal

643
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,520
they would become illegal om through the
modification applause

644
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,530
due to the complaint serve big business
to the government

645
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,839
to crack down on on hacking are many
these laws were enacted around 1986

646
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,279
and not but they wouldn't really be
tried om

647
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,859
officially until a few years later arm

648
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:48,960
but this the trust that we always

649
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,369
assumed was existed between

650
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:56,260
job our fellow man obviously as you can
see from

651
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,690
the stories I've Kevin and not and
Bernie about

652
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,089
was not the case and certainly would

653
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:08,380
can fall apart over time as a government
became more involved in

654
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,190
are in hackers and I'm prosecuting
hackers

655
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,020
om hackers a human beings as well and
not

656
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,730
we began to see this chick are our trust
model basically fall apart

657
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,240
on since we were packing

658
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,720
using I mean the reason why we had these
handles in the first place was not

659
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,970
because we're playing cloak-and-dagger
games it was because we were doing

660
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,270
things that were legal and we need to

661
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:39,109
protect their personal identity and this
was mutually respected between hackers

662
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:42,690
for for a hacker to %ah

663
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:48,480
even to divulge the identity of another
hacker to other hackers was frowned upon

664
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,680
om certainly tune %ah

665
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,930
to give information about what a hacker
was doing

666
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,770
on to the feds to volunteer this
information was was unheard of

667
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,000
on the fact that it's %uh so easily done

668
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,170
today are for personal gain

669
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,690
or to avoid prosecution

670
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,000
is really a as self-serving behavior

671
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,010
that simply didn't exist back then om

672
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,819
and it's unfortunate that things have
changed this to this degree

673
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:26,200
arm there have been many people who have
come about over the years

674
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,550
who were holy self-serving om kevin's
example up by Justin Peterson

675
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,809
is a eyes a prime example and
unfortunately he's not here to defend

676
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:37,950
himself because he's dead

677
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,510
om Justin Peterson actually died

678
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,099
couple months ago was in a very severe
om

679
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:49,329
I'm not dancing on a grave or anything
but other people might

680
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:53,200
on just actually use to either just in
from PBS's

681
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,450
in the late 1980s and I'm

682
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,400
used to call me up quite frequently and
used to discuss hacking switches

683
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,930
on the only reason I can imagine and I
knew he was

684
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,379
are on the run supposedly and Dom

685
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,770
doing things have a questionable major I
didn't know that he was informing on

686
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,520
people

687
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,599
are at least double Kevin or Kevin
Paulson

688
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,210
on when I met the California hackers in
the early nineties and we

689
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,869
we sat down and discussed exactly what
it is just ended

690
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:28,329
became apparent to me would what did
happen by Tom much of what

691
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:31,569
%uh Justin new ended with

692
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:35,670
om switches in in around California and
I guess

693
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:40,859
elsewhere when he was on the run arm I
hesitate to say he learned from me

694
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:44,720
arm the only reason I can imagine he
didn't inform on me personally is

695
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,819
because I was such a good source of
information to him

696
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,890
on which is unfortunate because had I
known

697
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,200
what he was doing certainly I would've
hesitated to talk to him but again

698
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,780
I knew him from a bulletin board systems
and had no reason to

699
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,440
to doubt the veracity of what it is that
he was telling

700
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,329
arm how many people you're familiar with
the gang were in cyberspace

701
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,740
Elodie verses and would be I look at
that

702
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,730
I'll look at that okay on never happen
would it surprise you to find that out

703
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,109
that it never happen there was no we're
in cyberspace there was never a war

704
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,119
between a low the animal the was a
complete fabrication

705
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,700
but was in the mass media that's true it
was a mass me that means it must be true

706
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,250
read in the newspapers yet the all these
guys read it om

707
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,430
it was a fabrication by the US
Attorney's Office

708
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,480
I N the media people that I was friends
with when I was indicted

709
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,819
thought it was completely ludicrous and
didn't report it as such

710
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:46,050
on other journalists up what's a

711
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,400
lesser journalistic integrity and
latched onto the story because it made

712
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,790
great friends

713
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,339
gang were in cyberspace it was like
literally the west side story

714
00:40:55,339 --> 00:41:00,480
above the hacker underground we got we
got the rich kids in Texas verses the

715
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,770
inner city kids in

716
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,930
in New York I mean what better story to
tell its rights and books print some

717
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,890
articles

718
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,930
write some some magazine articles tune
you know there's some photo spreads in

719
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:16,399
you know if that makes for great company
om unfortunately

720
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,780
%uh that's not what happen arm

721
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,180
what I will say is that there was a
great amount of disagreement and

722
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,759
dissension within

723
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,960
Elodie are in the out late 1980s

724
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,970
because love the fact that there was

725
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,740
informing going on on several people
several members of the Legion of Doom

726
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,010
had gotten

727
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:43,690
on busted under mysterious let's just
say mysterious circumstances

728
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,559
people that we knew people that we were
affiliated in other countries

729
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:52,490
%uh for example hacker group in
Australia are were busted under

730
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,210
are suspicious circumstances

731
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,750
on which all lead to a certain
individual that we all

732
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,530
on no one love in Texas who mom had
started one of the first a hacker

733
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,130
consultancy's

734
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,970
are under the auspices love gaining
clout

735
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,450
are with the FBI and telco security

736
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,309
person referring to us is Eric Bloodaxe
in case it wasn't clear to anyone in the

737
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,349
audience

738
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,809
arm he actually

739
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:27,240
job was I remember a fellow d on melody
was a

740
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,450
one of the first so organized hacker
group in a very disorganized computer

741
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,510
underground

742
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,059
and the main purpose love Elodie
initially was

743
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:39,530
arm to take information for knowing that
was found trashing

744
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,270
add telco central offices I and type it
in

745
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,190
I make it available and what would what
were known as Elodie texan's

746
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,390
which were available online not in text
file sections of the a bulletin board

747
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,359
systems

748
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:57,569
so-called delete bulletin board systems
%ah that required a

749
00:42:57,569 --> 00:43:01,009
a certain amount of trust to to gain
access to

750
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,390
OMS I see some people in the audience
that were

751
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,348
involved during those times that
remember this om

752
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:11,809
bottom or rat you out give

753
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:15,920
thanks are what happened swords the

754
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,540
the late 1980s when om there were things
like operation Sun Devil

755
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,650
which had nothing to do with el-ad
directly

756
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,990
on there was here fast was formed BFF
got involved

757
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,440
in my case in phnom summer the other
hacker cases at the time

758
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,380
mom there are there was a lot more
government involvement in the hacker

759
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,260
underground in general and not because
of that fact

760
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,089
got two things happened a lot of people
are who had not gotten in trouble yet

761
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,640
didn't want to risk any more they were
ready older particularly at the older

762
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,220
generation a Packers

763
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,799
on some guys that I knew who started a
load the for example

764
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:57,180
on withdrew from %ah the hacker
underground

765
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,348
that simply didn't want to risk getting
in trouble anymore

766
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:03,579
now that the climate change so much arm

767
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:07,609
other hackers are a few let's say

768
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:10,640
arm thought dad it might be good

769
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,390
to going the other direction and attempt
to

770
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:19,990
our gain clout with the government and
telco security by inviting them

771
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,240
onto a bulletin board that was set up

772
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,640
under the auspices love mom

773
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,960
creating a dialogue between hackers and
a

774
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,760
security people and the FBI and Secret
Service

775
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,349
worldcom might sound a little ridiculous
to think about but on

776
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:43,910
the FBI thought it was great because it
gave them a chance to on

777
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,759
our chat with hackers and then arrest
them arm

778
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,910
so it was really convenient for for
everyone involved

779
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,089
mom for

780
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:58,690
go straight to jail one-stop shopping
exactly nom

781
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,160
I personally had a big problem with this
%uh not only with the security

782
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,549
consultancy that was set up in Texas but
also with the fact that

783
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:10,809
nom I read products that would be really
great idea to try to

784
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:14,530
are bring back lol the up from what it
was

785
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,319
in the absence of any real leadership in
the group anymore because anyone who

786
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,630
mattered anymore had withdrawn

787
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,210
om he basically appointed himself leader
of the group

788
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,980
which is why whenever you read all
stories in the media says

789
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,819
I love the verses MOT arm a lot about
was bolstered by

790
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:35,910
himself in addition to them the media
and

791
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,279
and the government later but prior art
within its move this along but you know

792
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,770
that this

793
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,069
just to summarize you had a situation
where I

794
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:46,520
this member a fellow the on an art

795
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,130
on on various people in New York

796
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,520
because according to him has he felt his
business was in danger

797
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,710
any had to be something and I'm I think
he later said he was sorry that you got

798
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:58,710
caught up in all that

799
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,640
yeah I i mean that to make a long story
short on

800
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,920
it became known to even other Elodie
members who were wondering if I had

801
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,319
heard anything about

802
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,319
are Bloodaxe because they were concerned
for their own safety

803
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,509
are when they heard about what happened
with some hackers in Australia and

804
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,260
others

805
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,799
and suspected that he was involved but
he was trying to gain clout with the

806
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:20,460
government

807
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,420
that the bolsters business on and in
doing so was turning in hackers

808
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:30,579
arm when hackers found out he was doing
this they began harassing him at his

809
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,859
business and so on which is

810
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:36,180
you know one hackers do in general and
certainly someone who's informing on

811
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,460
other hackers is

812
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,660
is for is gonna earned the wrath I've

813
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:45,069
other actors om so he decided that I was
responsible for this

814
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:48,529
based on some previous disagreements we
had

815
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,359
and decided that he was going to inform
on me in

816
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:56,119
various my friends here in New York arm

817
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:59,990
by giving information the FBI about us
and so on and so forth

818
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,369
om ultimately as as a as a manual said

819
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:08,329
and which is interesting because it goes
in line with with what bernie said is

820
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:09,339
that a

821
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:13,390
after some time passes and I guess these
people have a guilty conscience think

822
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,290
they try to contact you when

823
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,599
and clear their their conscience by by
apologizing

824
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,859
there is no apology for sending me to
prison for a year

825
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:27,299
I'm sorry but there just isn't

826
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:29,099
and

827
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:32,549
drifting I for cipro this after

828
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:37,169
after that whole escapade with in your
own loosely organized group matches at

829
00:47:37,169 --> 00:47:38,400
the section amor de

830
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,089
you had not one but two informants the
SOS things

831
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:46,049
as things fell apart arm EFSF was a

832
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:49,479
was supporting us to go to trial arm

833
00:47:49,479 --> 00:47:54,079
they felt that we were not guilty love
what the US attorneys were saying we did

834
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,179
there was even at least one attempt by
one of the complainants in the case

835
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:02,939
a british telecom time net wanting to
actually an interview us

836
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:06,459
which %ah if we were given the
opportunity would have

837
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:10,949
%ah shown cooperation and would have
given us the opportunity to tell them

838
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:12,369
exactly what we did

839
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:15,880
we would've met the engineers to build
the network they were interested how we

840
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,140
defeated their security

841
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,769
sounds like a movie but unfortunately
the US attorney's office did not allow

842
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:23,209
them to do this

843
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:26,229
so we were never given the opportunity
to clear our name

844
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:30,369
so we're basically treated like
criminals and due to that fact

845
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:33,789
%ah one by one the the

846
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:37,119
got my friends the guys that were named
in the indictment

847
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,759
on decided to plead guilty are until

848
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:44,609
I was the only one remaining and it's
you know the typical cliche im

849
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:49,169
the last guy standing without a chair
when the music stops and what happened

850
00:48:49,169 --> 00:48:50,279
was om

851
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:55,400
on two guys a some people familiar with
Julio in

852
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,890
and I'm Alan who was the person that
bernie was referring to

853
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:03,328
on decided to do on testify against me

854
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:06,380
and I as a result are

855
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,859
they never did any time they never did
any time in prison to this day

856
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,308
which is ironic because in the
indictment itself

857
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,859
there among the people that are named
the most and typical

858
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,869
it as if it is typical because saddam

859
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:23,209
on personally I'm among well-known

860
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:27,119
up personality I guess some would say

861
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,979
a of some kind a celebrity status the US
attorney's office wanted to

862
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:35,429
argues that fact to %ah

863
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:40,449
take advantage of that fact at to set an
example as the judge said in case

864
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:44,409
and I'm as a result they were willing to

865
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:47,979
deal with the people who have the most
to lose are

866
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:51,599
in the indictment which charged with the
most counts in the indictment in order

867
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,859
to use me as the

868
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:56,459
the scapegoat and succeed in prosecuting
somebody

869
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:59,640
to make the corporation's happy up now
we have

870
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,229
I've been through the most interesting
stories in packer history right up here

871
00:50:03,229 --> 00:50:06,229
on stage I don't think we've ever open
on state same time SATs

872
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:09,880
that's an amazing thing right there
fiberglass a quick question did you did

873
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,269
you

874
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:13,609
were you given an opportunity by the
federal government to work

875
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:18,009
provide substantial assistance or any
kind of assistance to them

876
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:21,119
in providing information and others they
would might want to prosecute

877
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,499
no actually I refuse to cooperate with
the government completely right and I

878
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:27,039
wouldn't want to play it today if they
said your proper letter

879
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,259
or anything like that now than ever they
never sent me a letter or anything like

880
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:33,140
that because I made it clear early on
through my attorney that I was not

881
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,368
willing to cooperate

882
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:37,659
and my sentence was actually longer
because of that fact

883
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:41,219
yeah I'd willing to write up I got a
proper letter as well are

884
00:50:41,219 --> 00:50:44,589
and I def did not respond to it I this
I'll take responsibility for my own

885
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:46,538
actions I will not speak for or

886
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:49,549
about anyone else its and are they they
take

887
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:53,349
vanish their vengeful about that when
you were few they take that personally

888
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:56,509
it's a lot of pressure put on people and
our

889
00:50:56,509 --> 00:50:59,199
obvious a lot of people crack we've seen
that happen and that's why there are so

890
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,380
many informants in the

891
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,159
in the community up by which were given
this panel to ours we have another 30

892
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:06,039
minutes we're so much ground to cover

893
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,659
I'm sure you've all heard of the latest
I case which

894
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:13,539
probably many view here for are
concerning

895
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:16,869
the the keynote speaker here at them I
hope

896
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:20,749
Julian assigns a wiki leaks an
interesting story that that

897
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:24,909
is behind that where r on that this this
kid in the army

898
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:29,239
I was allegedly releasing on classified
information including

899
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:33,359
videotapes that were very damning to to
the US military

900
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:39,219
on and done what wound up happening
according to a report in wired

901
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:44,140
I is that that this particular person in
the Army befriended somebody within the

902
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,150
hacker community

903
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,449
and proceeded to tell him all kinds of
interesting things

904
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:51,939
and done that person in the hacker
community

905
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:55,759
arm felt compelled to tournament in

906
00:51:55,759 --> 00:52:00,109
now I've been told by many many people

907
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:04,339
that it's insane to dive into this

908
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:07,679
that even though this is happening right
here at hope that we have

909
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,359
a the keynote speaker reading wiki leaks

910
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,529
involved in this we have the person who

911
00:52:14,529 --> 00:52:19,259
who turned then the that the person who
began to make the alleged

912
00:52:19,259 --> 00:52:23,099
the alleged get the wanna be the
tournament know you've turned it be in

913
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:23,749
your bed

914
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:26,819
I was getting to the alleged yeah he is
alleged will be very

915
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:31,369
not anywhere are so I'm we have that
person I who has been attending the

916
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:32,359
conference

917
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:36,639
on should be avoided controversy which
we dive right into it

918
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,439
I say of course we dive right into it we
confront this thing had I'm

919
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:45,189
I

920
00:52:45,189 --> 00:52:50,019
fun it involves a leap of faith and I i
have that faith in you guys

921
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:54,259
being civil listening coming to your own
conclusions

922
00:52:54,259 --> 00:52:57,599
letting people who we disagree with we
may disagree with

923
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,549
severely have their say so that we can I

924
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:05,079
judge for ourselves and not just based
on what we're told by our friends were

925
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:06,769
told in the mass media

926
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:09,889
I i cant darkness for people on both
sides of the spectrum because I like

927
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:10,569
being told

928
00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:13,989
how I should feel what I should say
alright I want to reach a conclusion

929
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:15,630
myself and that's going to involve

930
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,469
asking questions everybody so

931
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:23,519
do we all agree that the we're gonna let
this guy have his say

932
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:30,519
a civil matter

933
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,679
and I think we also need to acknowledge
it takes a lot of balls to show up

934
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,759
in a crowd that's potentially very hot
style

935
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:41,569
and stand your ground the matter what
you think love what he stands for what

936
00:53:41,569 --> 00:53:42,319
he did

937
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,829
all right we ground that too alright

938
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:52,219
with that i cant this Adrian lamo and I
will let him out

939
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:56,049
say his piece ask some questions and
hopefully learn something

940
00:53:56,049 --> 00:54:02,049
Adrian are you can go go ahead

941
00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:05,219
for but

942
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:12,219
ice cover

943
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:15,839
good day friends neighbors and opponents

944
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,449
that above I I would say from the get-go

945
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:24,249
I i don't feel that and the opponents
have anybody in this crowd

946
00:54:24,249 --> 00:54:29,729
you may feel differently I and II
respect your right to do so

947
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:35,789
on but before I dive in to the wiki
leaks related controversy

948
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:39,109
I A want to go back to a story that

949
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:44,489
is very similar to one to several love
the ones that have been told here just

950
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,829
now

951
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:50,969
on in June 20 Oct 3 I was arrested by
the FBI

952
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:54,669
I was given basically the same

953
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:57,949
I talk hey you know I would really be
cool

954
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:01,059
if you add if you add it all I've your
friends to us is being

955
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:04,889
career criminals and II did not do that

956
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:08,409
you can you can hop on to pacer

957
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:13,429
and you can get the court transcripts
and what what what you'll find is that I

958
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:14,089
out here

959
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:18,788
responsibility because I believe people
own their actions

960
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:22,309
on some love you may have been here last
night

961
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:25,659
for the screening of the film hackers
wanted

962
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:30,109
what I was doing at that time

963
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:33,609
is but I do believe on

964
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:38,749
private first class Manning was doing
which is acting one's conscience

965
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:42,039
on in my case I want to set a precedent

966
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:46,689
whereby hackers could approach
corporations

967
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:49,689
and have the outcome be positive

968
00:55:49,689 --> 00:55:53,158
have the outcome b1 where did

969
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:56,789
corporations walked away saying hey you
know what

970
00:55:56,789 --> 00:56:01,209
that wasn't so bad the the the take the
stacker people can actually help us turn

971
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:03,389
out all out to get us

972
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:07,339
on the New York Times Square preparation
disagreed

973
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:11,189
on they press charges as I was said that
I did

974
00:56:11,189 --> 00:56:14,549
I A pled guilty because I was guilty

975
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:18,699
I'm that was my acceptance of
responsibility

976
00:56:18,699 --> 00:56:22,880
on fast forward a couple of years

977
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:29,589
on one in a long series of people sent
me a random instant message saying

978
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:32,729
hey have a look at what I did and I was
like at for

979
00:56:32,729 --> 00:56:35,959
whatever our get to that because

980
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:39,329
a lot a lot of people do approach me
with

981
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:44,059
information about their ongoing on
computer hacking

982
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:47,619
when that hacking involves think that
are actually genuinely

983
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:51,609
cool and interesting all say Ganesh a
Gayatri sure tell me more

984
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:54,959
I'm interested when it involves

985
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:58,709
crimes be they financial or otherwise

986
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:01,739
hurtful to actual individuals in the
real world

987
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:05,689
but not life-threatening I'll tell them
hey

988
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:10,678
shut the hell up in to let me put you in
touch with this attorney and now

989
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:15,529
on in this case I didn't really have
either of those two choices

990
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:19,839
because the on the die was already cast

991
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,299
on I A

992
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:26,599
was made aware that

993
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:31,159
over a quarter million documents had
been allegedly leak

994
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,469
on that were classified State Department
cables

995
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:38,939
on they had been sent to WikiLeaks we
WikiLeaks had a presence here at this

996
00:57:38,939 --> 00:57:40,908
conference I think that they gave

997
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:44,089
an interesting talk on

998
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:47,808
but conspicuously they didn't mention
those cables

999
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:51,349
and I A

1000
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:56,130
can't really say well white by that is
operating on about three hours of sleep

1001
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:59,170
and I didn't happen up until

1002
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,249
right before the this was happening that
I've gonna be talking

1003
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:06,099
so please forgive me if I had gone off a
little bit rough

1004
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:11,199
on the information that

1005
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:14,569
was allocated to me via Instant
Messenger was

1006
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:19,179
that on information have been downloaded

1007
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:23,329
cables essentially a fall tracking lot
of cables

1008
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:27,299
more cables at cables in this case being
an anachronism

1009
00:58:27,299 --> 00:58:30,989
for the diplomatic version email

1010
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:34,539
headband downloaded on

1011
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:38,479
to a computer in Iraq that

1012
00:58:38,479 --> 00:58:41,689
head then used another route

1013
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:47,949
to submit them to WikiLeaks on

1014
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:50,989
is there anybody here in this audience
that things that they could go through

1015
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:54,209
250,000 multi-page documents

1016
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:58,349
that contain classified information
about diplomacy throughout the world

1017
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:03,549
and say for certain that it's not gonna
cost anybody's life

1018
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:10,549
anyone

1019
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,110
and

1020
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:15,860
and I don't see any hands bit the lights
are kinda brighter

1021
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,220
in that case

1022
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,440
I felt compelled

1023
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,980
compelled I don't believe is too strong
a word

1024
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:32,620
what the real

1025
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,830
what did you feel compelling would in
what way did you feel people would put

1026
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:36,279
at risk

1027
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,700
there are a number of ways

1028
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,680
in which that information could put
people at risk the state department

1029
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,620
is involved in a number intelligence
operations throughout the world time

1030
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:52,150
they're not supposed to be but they're
looking out for the interests of

1031
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,130
Americans

1032
00:59:53,130 --> 01:00:00,130
and okay I V SA office they were taken
but I'll be open for care for funn

1033
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,740
infinitely qana is is probably the most
important thing

1034
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,540
because you guys know better than I do
what you want to know

1035
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:19,680
will be handed out darts and bows and
arrows also if anybody thought to bring

1036
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,860
pitchforks

1037
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,280
and maybe some torches that that be cool
to on

1038
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,700
if people want to ask questions they can
I wanna be on the second microphone

1039
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,300
there

1040
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,640
microphone and with a weapons behind

1041
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,299
but that when they can finish first as I
was stating

1042
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,820
state department operations throughout
the world involve

1043
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,300
both american intelligence activities
and the activities

1044
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,500
a american tourists and travelers abroad

1045
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,840
I'm if you soon the

1046
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:54,100
most innocent possible scenario that it
would do nothing

1047
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,540
but make the US look bad in countries
abroad

1048
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,580
on thats would still leave

1049
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:05,410
people sitting high and dry if they need
consular assistance if they're arrested

1050
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:06,140
abroad

1051
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,609
by country is suddenly decided that they
weren't too friendly with the US anymore

1052
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:15,900
if do you approve if you would on assume
the worst possible scenario that it

1053
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,030
actually does

1054
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:22,240
expose that the identities a people
involved in intelligence operations or

1055
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,560
even have the parents have been involved
in intelligence operations by being

1056
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,060
employees have consulates missions and
embassies abroad

1057
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:37,340
then you have the very real possibility
that lives would be lost

1058
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:41,010
Internet can I ask you a question if it
had just been the video

1059
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:45,770
just a video that had been released a
few months ago and not the 260,000

1060
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,970
classified documents

1061
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,060
what you're done absolutely not

1062
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,580
and I'm not going to win any friends in
the federal government by saying this

1063
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,900
on bed you wouldn't you wouldn't have
turned a man using

1064
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,040
saying you wouldn't have turned a min
based on just the video

1065
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,290
when I I knew about the video

1066
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,740
I did not contact anybody regarding his
activities

1067
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,490
I ate din think that there is anything
to be gained by it

1068
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:17,140
maya was the documents I thought that
there is a possibility

1069
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,210
that they could be recovered or the very
least

1070
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:24,550
dead there could be it a

1071
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:29,640
the reduced probability that they would
be released

1072
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:34,129
if the government had the opportunity to
take prompt action

1073
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:37,940
and I know that this is Andy Kravetz
always friendly towards the government

1074
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,930
how I haven't always been friendly
towards the government

1075
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:45,780
to this day I'm not from the trades are
all arms to the government

1076
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,400
II X thank you

1077
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,070
and and

1078
01:02:54,070 --> 01:03:01,070
I A E explicitly requested that no

1079
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:04,440
FBI agents that Bernard involve

1080
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:11,440
and on investigating hackers that nobody
that was involved in anything except for

1081
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,590
investigating

1082
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:19,610
computer crimes involve in being
classified national security systems

1083
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:23,710
be involved in the investigation that
was my does my

1084
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:27,510
terms that was a good the only way that
I was going to sit down with any

1085
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,360
investigators and talk to them

1086
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,950
and their

1087
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:37,740
like that that's it well scherer have on

1088
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:42,090
and it was

1089
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:45,860
a surprisingly pleasant than undertaken
in the sense that

1090
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:50,020
I was never coach wagon remember
something from the logs

1091
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,180
nobody said well are you sure can't have
been this way are you sure can't have

1092
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:57,480
been that way they simply said okay
we're gonna react that from the

1093
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,170
affidavit then

1094
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:02,750
on I think that the government behaved
themselves better

1095
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:07,300
them a lot of people would give them
credit for

1096
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,430
on to set the record clear I'm

1097
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:15,010
not an informant and the witness and a
criminal case

1098
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:18,820
on day in

1099
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,490
its not that different in mind is:

1100
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:25,900
from being a witness an

1101
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,850
any other case that could involve
potential loss of life

1102
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:33,600
and other let me say it's it's you have
been a pleasant experience

1103
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,090
for you %uh that you're working with the
government on this I guess

1104
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:41,570
but Bradley Manning the the alleged a
weaker

1105
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:44,680
is currently sitting in prison in kuwait
i believe

1106
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,980
and a he could be locked up for the rest
of his life

1107
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,920
you feel about their on

1108
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,410
I i think that it's good a little bit
ludicrous

1109
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:58,629
isn't to say that Bradley Manning's
going to be tortured with

1110
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:01,710
we don't do that right to are things

1111
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:05,690
for

1112
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:09,750
om I still open but they voted for the
day and it depends on your definition of

1113
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,870
torture but the

1114
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:13,859
well as a measure to measure the
question but how do you feel about

1115
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,910
whatever state you think he's in right
now

1116
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:21,640
because I love because of your actions
he's not far from where he was to begin

1117
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,990
with when he signed up for an
all-volunteer army

1118
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:30,470
find the forms indicating that he would
handle classified material appropriately

1119
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:34,410
he took a even if you just talking about
the video

1120
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:38,480
the cloak ily called Collateral Murder
video

1121
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,870
he took it from a Jag the Judge Advocate
General's

1122
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:45,310
office on officers computer

1123
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:49,810
that indicates that they were
investigating and most likely at at that

1124
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,640
time

1125
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,859
that he could have compromised an
investigation so if there was a war

1126
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,470
criminal involved here they could walk
free

1127
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:59,560
because evidence was compromised be as a
result

1128
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,840
mister Manning's actions on

1129
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,550
not sure what people are voting for
their were criminals working for your

1130
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:10,330
on a I ivory

1131
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:14,750
people it okay was not shutting out when
I asked questions about Mike Francis

1132
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:17,710
know that the mic from now people on the
panel ask Adrian

1133
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:21,680
land mines in a judge presiding was one
thing that

1134
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,240
on not really understanding that I'm
dying to know and I'm sure many people

1135
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,740
in the audience are dying to know is why
your witness

1136
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:32,690
I'll a person that in I mean in my
estimation is have no particular

1137
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:35,530
importance to this case whatsoever

1138
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:39,080
why did the soldier approach you with
this information that's what I'm not

1139
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,720
understand

1140
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,070
I think only mister meaning can really
answer that question

1141
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:48,440
II don't known what was going through
his mind necessarily

1142
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,730
he indicated that

1143
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:55,280
a good on I'm gonna backtracked love it
again contact you because you're in

1144
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,240
Wired magazine in these are you and he
won't you be a friend to him

1145
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,450
on he indicated that he had seen my name
in a search on Twitter

1146
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:08,180
for few weeks and the reason for that is
that I have

1147
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:12,360
been a longtime supporter which legs and
M this day

1148
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,400
I believe that the mission is important

1149
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,860
I A think that they should continue to
go forward

1150
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:23,210
and I think that they should focus on
oppressive regimes throughout the world

1151
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:27,360
that

1152
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:31,810
is anyone in this room being oppressed
right now

1153
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:35,230
I'm not by us I'll alright are we have
some

1154
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:38,620
audience questions a star the first
minute please not know speeches

1155
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,799
make make it short just think that's
trying to shut any buy them here we have

1156
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,630
to say to her

1157
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:46,560
ir is it so I appreciate your
willingness to stand up in front and

1158
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,670
talk to us

1159
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:51,090
but this topic I'm hearing you say i'm
talking to Adrian here

1160
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:54,990
because it was unclear is that the
number you say has a lot of American

1161
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,150
exceptionalism

1162
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,680
like you seem to think that american
lives are worth more than the lives that

1163
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,620
for example being taken

1164
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:05,049
not a murderer

1165
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:10,290
I wanna know how do you justify that
actually I haven't said that it all what

1166
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,540
I've said it is

1167
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:15,190
that there may have been were criminals
involved those being the helicopter

1168
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,350
pilots

1169
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:19,549
I wasn't there I can say for sure but

1170
01:08:19,549 --> 01:08:23,350
that there was apparently an
investigation going on based on the back

1171
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,460
to bed

1172
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:28,710
there the video was found and the
computer oven officer vid

1173
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:33,720
the judicial branch of the military and
that that investigation may have been

1174
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,609
compromised

1175
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:37,670
so if anything i'm saying bed the

1176
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:42,140
on there were americans involved who may
have been involved in misconduct

1177
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,549
based on looking at the video on

1178
01:08:45,549 --> 01:08:48,990
I would encourage people throughout the
audience look at its full

1179
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:53,170
unedited form but nevertheless even it
sounded

1180
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,950
form it does appear somewhat damning

1181
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:00,479
om you're not answering my question
about why

1182
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,500
you think that the potential american
lives say

1183
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,729
tourists in other countries who might
have you know might feel worse

1184
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,859
or might be more scared people think
americans are jerks

1185
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:15,770
because are actual activities are being
exposed

1186
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,900
alright when I was out here

1187
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,080
there you're not my question is why you
thought those

1188
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,769
were privileged above the lives that we
are taking everyday

1189
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:30,020
in Iraq and Afghanistan why are you
willing to provide which goes live

1190
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:34,720
the lives ok because those are the lives
that I have the opportunity

1191
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:40,270
to try to affect positively I A

1192
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:43,430
I I'm not holding machine-gun

1193
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:47,810
I'm not sitting in Afghanistan I am not
shooting at people

1194
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:52,380
that are in their own hearts and minds

1195
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:56,120
trying to followed their on conscience

1196
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,830
be it a misguided

1197
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:04,220
or be it a correct action I i don't have
standing to say

1198
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,610
on there's AV very good

1199
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:11,099
quote that a friend of mine who've all
things is

1200
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,490
a little league umpire uses

1201
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:17,510
on very often when wanna visit

1202
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:21,320
his calls is question and that's

1203
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,620
well okay I i appreciate your input book

1204
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,920
what did you see from where I was
standing

1205
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,980
Ange generally speaking the answer is
not a damn thing

1206
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:36,070
because they were in the bleachers price
move on to the next question

1207
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:39,670
okay so angry much like stepping up a as
a follow-up

1208
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:43,140
because I do not think that you
understood what my

1209
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:46,770
the guy before me ask the problem is
that your

1210
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:50,090
political viewpoint your pubes your
viewpoint and by you

1211
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:53,460
acted like you acted is highly US
centric

1212
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,800
that's the point it's not about that you
wanna whenever it's US centric

1213
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,770
it signed from Europe I do not care a
shit about the US government's

1214
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:06,120
and actually I do not care %ah

1215
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,280
and I don't give a shit about my
government's because I think that nation

1216
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,320
states are crappy

1217
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,870
and he should not be anyway support
nation-states in whatever they do with

1218
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,110
their bullshit okie

1219
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:22,639
I mean we a community of hey Chris weird
internationalists

1220
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,080
okay and we should work together
incorporate and not just like

1221
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,970
blame some guy because he actually
really did the right thing in a

1222
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:34,950
the right thing means I meet we didn't
start the stupid warrior

1223
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:39,380
come on it's there should be here K i
right

1224
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:43,310
right back hurts so our I might sound a
little bit naive

1225
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:47,630
here but I think that we should focus on
international point of view

1226
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:52,360
and not about what's good for the United
States okay

1227
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:56,540
our next question fellow I heard about
it Samsung responded

1228
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:02,590
gripper briefly to that and save

1229
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:06,200
I don't support every action that the
united states takes

1230
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,809
and you know what that's my rate is
citizen of this country

1231
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:15,900
to do and and a lot of countries that
would get you a bullet to the head

1232
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,350
com I

1233
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:23,610
if I see my time focusing on

1234
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:27,759
the united states that might have
something to do with the fact is that

1235
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,860
I'm an American citizen my dad the dual
national

1236
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:34,620
I've lived overseas but we are sitting
in a hotel

1237
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:38,760
that last time I checked is located in
the United States America

1238
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,620
on that has afforded us the opportunity
to have this conference

1239
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:47,680
even though a lot of people and the
government don't fully understand what

1240
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,620
we're about

1241
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,880
and somehow CSS threat and despite

1242
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,090
that we have the freedom to

1243
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:59,230
to hold this conference to have talks
about things that

1244
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:02,250
to the I informed observer would sound
threatening

1245
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,930
and that's not something that you get in
a lot of places so I think that

1246
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:10,730
thats pretty darn cool to have is an
opportunity in this country

1247
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:13,990
ok an expression

1248
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:18,840
fresh hi Adrian on

1249
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,280
I'm under the impression that you

1250
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,660
could be culpable if it came back you
know somehow they got

1251
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:29,740
if they'd realize it this person was
doing it by other means they would have

1252
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:30,530
figured out

1253
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,809
eventually possibly a to other
investigations

1254
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:38,030
and that they would have seen a chat log
to you and you could have been

1255
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:41,370
culpable you know criminally for this
officer

1256
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:44,990
it seems to me is was at a part of your

1257
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:49,510
thinking you know and not a jurist and
now then turning

1258
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:54,040
I am NOT a judge I A don't have

1259
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:58,650
v legal background to be able to say
whether or not that would have been the

1260
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,780
case

1261
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:03,130
my first reaction and I mean reaction
with

1262
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:08,190
holy frack and craft 260,000 documents
you think that you could look for those

1263
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:10,210
and say that they're not going to

1264
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:13,420
because anybody's what led

1265
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,880
life to be lost or

1266
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,690
are ability to try and

1267
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:23,850
make the world a better place which we
do in

1268
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:27,980
a lot of ways we provide aid to other
countries we also make the world the

1269
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:30,100
worst place an hour in some ways

1270
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:34,260
but were not a perfect nation no nation
is perfect

1271
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,990
reaction to something on screen right
now that his mission we are pro here

1272
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:41,840
a burning on expanded dismiss prison
without a word that is with our easy and

1273
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,510
have a family ticket sold at United
States Air

1274
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:48,640
and criminal statute I i wanted to ask
you a drink after dinner at the neck

1275
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,710
speaker here but

1276
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:53,100
on get it could occurred get it on was

1277
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:57,440
was your decision 2wd on influenced in
any way by

1278
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,550
your potential are risk liability for

1279
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:04,330
not on telling a government what you
learn

1280
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,340
because you could be criminally liable
for on

1281
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:10,800
not divulging what you whereof

1282
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,800
again I A don't have a GD in a manager
is

1283
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,520
to bird before all this happened i'd
never tried

1284
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:23,580
never heard the term that's hard to
pronounce that sounds being behind me

1285
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:27,059
om I A the

1286
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:32,400
you heard cover your ass before though

1287
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,190
yeah I think most people in this
audience have

1288
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:39,420
or assessor after the for on

1289
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,730
but again my main reaction was

1290
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:47,980
holy frack and craft 260,000 documents
and I think that

1291
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:53,160
is a reason that the keynote yesterday

1292
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,240
on totally ignored and that's because

1293
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:59,900
that much harder to get an emotional
rise at the audience

1294
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:05,160
when year eight easy to say am against
murder who's with me on that

1295
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,420
yeah I had known on murder it's harder
to say

1296
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:11,420
i'm for releasing over

1297
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,480
quarter-million diplomatic documents
related to you

1298
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,490
United States in US citizens who's with
me

1299
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:23,019
yeah cash for that coming

1300
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:27,560
expression thank you for stab wishing
that your post a murder

1301
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,460
that's great I there something that I
was unclear on how long has it been

1302
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,280
since you've had an active restraining
order against you for abusing a

1303
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,160
girlfriend

1304
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:40,430
i met your ex girlfriend she is a lovely
human being and she told me awful things

1305
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:43,950
this might be delving into the person or
a little bit but the

1306
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:48,929
I don't have to choose their to that
major I have never been served with a

1307
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:52,330
restraining order and there's never been
one has been active against me

1308
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:56,960
higher let's move on kinda to bed at
that kind of but

1309
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,500
um Adrian I do

1310
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,640
take to heart what you're on fire said I
do believe in it to you

1311
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,260
that I couldn't I think you're in a very
difficult position

1312
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:12,660
and that if Iran that position I'm well
I don't feel I would've made the same

1313
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:13,450
decision

1314
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:17,260
but knowing that you did I can accept
that you did

1315
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:21,030
but I really really hope

1316
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:24,130
that you can actually make some good
choices

1317
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:29,350
coming up in the future to repair some
damage that you have cost

1318
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:33,350
on before you walk away from the mic

1319
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:36,930
om apart from mister Manning

1320
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,980
criminal case could you clarify a little
bit on that damage

1321
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:44,050
briefly I because I'm not clear on
Birchwood from my perspective

1322
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:51,050
I see what you've done is treason right
next question

1323
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:57,050
I a June

1324
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:00,210
digital communications seems to allow us
these days

1325
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:03,320
the possibility although perhaps

1326
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,690
not easily to take our identities

1327
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:10,600
and to separate them they start to

1328
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,510
spread apart we can take that option

1329
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:18,210
weekend take the option to be different
people different people

1330
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:23,080
that different ways the LCS differently
you have

1331
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,230
identified with you know

1332
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:30,260
broader social American activity I was
wondering

1333
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:35,420
what do you think about ethics

1334
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,160
morals guiding principles for your
identity

1335
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,389
doesn't need to be cohesive doesn't need
to be singular

1336
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:46,870
I don't believe that I asking

1337
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:49,980
speak then I also don't necessarily know
that I

1338
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,600
understand the question credit for
freedom very briefly rephrase it

1339
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,380
very hypothetically if you could imagine
someone like you

1340
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,600
that hurt this could you imagine

1341
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,070
party yourself that would have had the
choice not to tell

1342
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:09,250
yes I can I A

1343
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:14,740
its I'll admit that it's unabashedly
selfish me to say this given what I've

1344
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:15,920
said but I A

1345
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,110
wish to hell that Bradley Manning had
never said a word to me

1346
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:23,450
on it it been

1347
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:26,840
I mean obviously it's been much worse
for him

1348
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,890
but its certainly been

1349
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:34,640
no picnic for me and I knew from the
get-go that

1350
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,990
its it was going to be

1351
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:44,990
AV low point in my interactions with the
community

1352
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,220
and I L that you could order

1353
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:53,930
when he first contacted you you're not
obliged to ever answer

1354
01:19:53,930 --> 01:20:00,930
you could simply ignored a minute that
would happen and mister Manning

1355
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,300
could have ignored the diplomatic cables
and you could have it nor the Collateral

1356
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,700
Murder video but he followed his
conscience as I did mine

1357
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,700
it however expected dude

1358
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,510
what in what capacity you think well
obviously

1359
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:21,270
Bradley Manning I came to you with this
information confidence

1360
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:26,020
on I believe seems logical anyway in
what capacity do you think you ve

1361
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,770
he felt that he could tell you these
things in confidence did he feel that he

1362
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:31,020
wished speaking to

1363
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,000
journalist our why do you think he
didn't know you write what some

1364
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,270
why do you think he trusted you and

1365
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:41,950
do you what do you feel about to your
actions

1366
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:47,120
and in respect to betraying the trust

1367
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,440
well as I A LQ ditch on just now

1368
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,690
I feel that in terms of betraying his
trust

1369
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,840
I was a bad friend I A

1370
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,240
on in and I think he approached me as a
friend

1371
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,660
and not

1372
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:08,440
analyst absolutely not and I A

1373
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,020
you make that clear to him that you were
not a your he was known

1374
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:15,620
speaking to you like as a source to
journalist

1375
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:19,240
without going into personal details
about mister meaning he spoke to me

1376
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,429
about a broad variety of things

1377
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:26,470
that word intensely personal to him on
most of which I haven't made public

1378
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:28,600
because they serve the public interest

1379
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,660
they were about his personal life

1380
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:36,040
about how he likes to live his life

1381
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:39,560
ir how so lay

1382
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,910
has elected to

1383
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:47,019
take him and which

1384
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:51,720
II and I wish that I I still had

1385
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,090
the the full logs minus the classified
section

1386
01:21:56,090 --> 01:22:01,000
I don't on but

1387
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,270
I believe that it's fair that here tune
anybody reading them

1388
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:09,610
that it was an interaction between

1389
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:12,920
on

1390
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,870
someone that receive another individual
as a friend

1391
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:21,540
and an individual who is trying to
figure out what the hell to do

1392
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:25,380
all right we have a very very long time
I work there one last audience member

1393
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:28,430
and then if you guys have a final words
are we don't want to run over

1394
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:31,730
find a question for every word Adrian on
you've been

1395
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:35,750
on you've had a lot of people put a lot
of

1396
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:40,170
actions the you are not responsible for
on your plate in terms of US foreign

1397
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:41,240
policy

1398
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:45,340
in terms a are perception in the world
and things the United States has been

1399
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,330
done bad least

1400
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:50,190
people search put that on you arm 1

1401
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:53,210
why do you feel that suddenly all these
things you

1402
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:56,490
service at before thats easy for some to
gather

1403
01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:00,910
murders bad at its core what do you
think is going on why is it that

1404
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:04,330
all these US policy things and
everything are getting attributed your

1405
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:08,410
actions those things are getting
connected

1406
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:12,110
that does that make sense is that it
makes sense at but it's hard for me to

1407
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:12,570
speak

1408
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:16,160
do simply because I A again

1409
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,320
can see way these people see from where
they're standing

1410
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:25,370
ans I E obviously respect their right to
have an opinion

1411
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,530
i havent told an invasion hecka

1412
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:32,349
when day hair

1413
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:37,660
elected to disagree with me that along
those lines I would say one thing is a

1414
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:41,130
anyone who particularly from a podium
says that

1415
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:44,790
they believe in peace and freedom
justice and what not and and the

1416
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:46,380
identities of people

1417
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:50,360
be people who are foreign throughout the
world trying to say that someone should

1418
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,030
not have an identity

1419
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,950
and they should have their name taken
away and that they should not be

1420
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,990
recognized as a human being

1421
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,960
because you disagree with their actions
is actually just as bad

1422
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,360
alright seven you gonna have the final
question

1423
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,809
peacemaker fast because we'd is coming
up next and he has

1424
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:12,110
skillet I believe no preferred

1425
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:17,679
my quick question is Is when he decided
to inform against Manning

1426
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,350
why did you have to go to the media why
didn't you just do it and keep it a

1427
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:22,580
secret and not

1428
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:29,580
a seek any type of media exposure

1429
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:35,520
primarily the same reason because

1430
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,110
II support WikiLeaks because I believe
in transparency

1431
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:43,670
and I believe no no no white why didn't
you just go to the

1432
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:47,800
law enforcement agencies and just keep
it quiet and not

1433
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,630
go to wired and tell them the story why
did you have to go

1434
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:55,870
and talk to the media about this case
why was that important to you

1435
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:59,830
why do people here support WikiLeaks
because they believe in public's right

1436
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:00,360
to know

1437
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,000
why do I support within weeks because I
believe im

1438
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,280
the majority of cases the public has a
right to know

1439
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,960
I believe in this case especially as
much as a

1440
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,750
effects people in this room

1441
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:18,670
people on the street who've never even
fact heard of it

1442
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:21,860
they would have a right to know

1443
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:24,860
so they would have the right to know
their a

1444
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:28,670
about Manning's activity so you wanna to
expose Manning

1445
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:33,590
through the press rather than just go to
law enforcement

1446
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:38,780
ultimately there would have been a press
release regarding Manning's activities

1447
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:42,559
from the a

1448
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,220
coming in from there from the arrest yes
and if they came much later there was so

1449
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,820
much media about this

1450
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:52,120
a and then later he was arrested so much
media

1451
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,730
you know i was just curious why you had
to go to the media and why you couldn't

1452
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,310
keep it quiet

1453
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:01,120
just curious

1454
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:07,750
to good question on I

1455
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:11,670
a when

1456
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:16,390
initially to a journalists to I knew to
be ethical

1457
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:20,030
Kevin the Polson who om

1458
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:23,309
is known many have you here

1459
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:28,400
and Josh

1460
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,830
I gave in background on

1461
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:35,490
on the case I didn't tell him go ahead
and run with this

1462
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,830
it was only after notebook but why did
you call him

1463
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:42,360
like why why didn't you just keep it a
secret

1464
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,820
well I believe that I i've answered that
question

1465
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:49,150
because the public's right to at least
wife have only because the

1466
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:52,300
the public has a right to know and
especially because

1467
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:56,450
wikiLeaks is so intimately tied to

1468
01:26:56,450 --> 01:27:00,000
the community that we have here and

1469
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
to many communities that believe in vino

1470
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,440
you have information that they

1471
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,350
would also have a right to know form
their own decisions

1472
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:14,360
if they chose to do so established for
the legal defense funds because everyone

1473
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:18,410
has a right to be represented to the
best of their ability

1474
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:22,240
om and the same reason

1475
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:26,349
that I A went to Kevin with my rest

1476
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:30,600
because I fell that as a former actor
himself

1477
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:34,940
he could represent the story better it
and the washington post ur The Wall

1478
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:35,960
Street Journal no

1479
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,730
and 10 a.m. Emeline guidance from there

1480
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:43,590
alright and gray says very graciously
allowed us a couple minutes to go over

1481
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:47,190
so it's like an attack as well as
cooking utensils just yet on

1482
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:51,050
so I'd like to just three people were
standing now and the fourth person you

1483
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,420
can sit down on the three people you get
asked questions really quickly no one no

1484
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,470
one else we have to

1485
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,000
and this at some point in our lives
that's it from here of

1486
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,720
so 1213 try to make it quick and Adrian
also

1487
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,840
me speak about supporting WikiLeaks and
transparency

1488
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,510
and this is the first time that we might
have had actual transparency into what

1489
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:10,840
the army was doing

1490
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,580
and current transparency that might have
changed the policy that might have and

1491
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,510
the war

1492
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:19,030
save lives over there in Iraq and bought
back

1493
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:23,769
the lives of those people that would be
involved in those missions

1494
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:28,220
so you say you're trying to prevent them
from dying this is the best way to do it

1495
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,940
so when I min have to disagree in
Stein's partial

1496
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,580
I don't believe that there is anything
that mister Manning released:

1497
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:38,870
that would have resulted in troops
pulling out of Iraq

1498
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:42,090
pulling out a van Afghanistan in

1499
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:45,470
are intervention overseas ending

1500
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:48,980
anyway here I

1501
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:53,350
it it may have cause change but it would
not been positive change

1502
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:56,690
in my estimation okay we have room for
two more I see more than two people

1503
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:59,870
standing so few numbers higher than to
please do not spend

1504
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:03,910
are I'm personable one good i was just
wondering

1505
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:09,209
arm I sign article that that you were
diagnosed with Aspergers enemy or 29

1506
01:29:09,209 --> 01:29:12,699
I know a lot of people make me have
including me i was just wondering what

1507
01:29:12,699 --> 01:29:13,869
your experience was with

1508
01:29:13,869 --> 01:29:17,889
you know it's kinda lonely on

1509
01:29:17,889 --> 01:29:20,900
I'll be brief is that little bit off
topic but

1510
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,219
a it was eye-opening for me I E in

1511
01:29:24,219 --> 01:29:27,969
each really understands

1512
01:29:27,969 --> 01:29:31,400
to some extent by I approach

1513
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:35,659
the world as much as I did way I
suffered from anxiety as much as I did

1514
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:39,320
and which on talking

1515
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:43,400
to part by medical professionals about
it was

1516
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:47,610
very helpful I i feel a lot better

1517
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:51,860
about my life now than I did before I
had real proper diagnosis

1518
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:56,268
alright next question and you know those
two people still standing after that I

1519
01:29:56,269 --> 01:29:57,340
have to admire your courage

1520
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:04,340
okay what you to speak as well but
that's it nobody else nobody out and

1521
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:07,499
quickly create I at first about the

1522
01:30:07,499 --> 01:30:11,829
about the cables arm I

1523
01:30:11,829 --> 01:30:15,469
trust with the leaks judgment above what
to release and what not to release

1524
01:30:15,469 --> 01:30:19,329
I think they've had an excellent record
so far and I trust WikiLeaks judgment a

1525
01:30:19,329 --> 01:30:22,579
lot more than I trust the government's
judgment of what should be released in

1526
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:29,579
what should not be

1527
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,090
secondly I think it's pretty clear
what's

1528
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:35,719
resulted from all this so far right
Manning

1529
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:40,500
is I in a break in kuwait somewhere
facing huge charges

1530
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:45,639
assigns is underground the ultimate
release of these cables is

1531
01:30:45,639 --> 01:30:49,090
in question who knows what's gonna
happen with this and I'm

1532
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:52,270
I think we need to be clear about what's

1533
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:56,210
what's acceptable to do and what's not
acceptable to do and I think

1534
01:30:56,210 --> 01:31:02,560
you fucked up huge higher expression

1535
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,840
at I respect your opinion that that's
not actually a question so it's not

1536
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,699
something I can respond to directly

1537
01:31:09,699 --> 01:31:13,699
okay next question ass a Vietnam veteran

1538
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:18,599
I think Manning did the right thing
anybody that thinks he's right mind

1539
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:22,060
that the US government you doing the
right thing have to be any

1540
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:29,060
mental institution and what you eat you
have to live with this and what do the

1541
01:31:29,849 --> 01:31:30,360
80s

1542
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:35,019
worth the tracing I think you'll be
lining went tannin

1543
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:39,099
known okay pain thank you

1544
01:31:39,099 --> 01:31:43,030
and final question here not a question
here

1545
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:46,750
has one and a %uh point out the to ask a
question that

1546
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:51,610
a your premise a is that you're saving
lives potentially by

1547
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:55,299
a try to prevent the release these
documents but arm

1548
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:59,719
as well ask you about I consider that is
pure speculation you don't know that

1549
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:01,119
it's necessarily gonna do anything

1550
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:04,509
and I could the police speculate that
especially given the track record in the

1551
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:05,409
US military

1552
01:32:05,409 --> 01:32:08,139
and United States State Department
throughout the world that by not

1553
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:11,040
releasing these documents you were going
to harm people's lives there is not any

1554
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:11,909
american lives

1555
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:16,679
and can you spot a are what I guess my
question is

1556
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:20,570
how do you know that not releasing these
documents is gonna save more lives than

1557
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,349
releasing them

1558
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:26,179
I can say for certain

1559
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:29,590
I up that's why did you make that
decision

1560
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:35,659
I made that decision based on the
information that I had access to

1561
01:32:35,659 --> 01:32:40,719
put the portions logs that are not
public and most that they will not be

1562
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,179
and I acted my conscience

1563
01:32:44,179 --> 01:32:47,659
just as I believe Manning after his
conscience just as a leave feeling is

1564
01:32:47,659 --> 01:32:49,440
Hans is acting his conscience

1565
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:55,349
I A understands that there are people
that are always going

1566
01:32:55,349 --> 01:33:00,119
to disagree with my choice and yeah I i
have to live with that choice

1567
01:33:00,119 --> 01:33:07,119
and you know what I I feel bad about the
predicament Manning is in

1568
01:33:07,219 --> 01:33:11,320
I I was in a bit and a similar one at
and

1569
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:16,460
well this if my answer and at

1570
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:21,320
at 22 I A was in shackles for acting on
my conscience

1571
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:25,269
as facing fifteen years in prison and

1572
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:31,090
I didn't send them off to some faith
that I had no comprehension out hooker

1573
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:35,659
real quick question up there's two
rupert did you see any other

1574
01:33:35,659 --> 01:33:40,969
classified cables BC one of them over
those two hundred fifty thousand

1575
01:33:40,969 --> 01:33:44,630
to the show you any of them no he did
not

1576
01:33:44,630 --> 01:33:48,150
so how do you really know you happen to
have been retracted osha's

1577
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:51,679
be did you I mean how did you really
know

1578
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:56,050
maybe he was exaggerating because he
wanted to become your friend or somebody

1579
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:56,800
who's this

1580
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,489
abortion so day I mean are you saying
that

1581
01:34:00,489 --> 01:34:04,969
that but by exaggerating think he had
fewer was it fun no I don't know if he

1582
01:34:04,969 --> 01:34:05,530
had any

1583
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:09,090
you know I just really don't know how
did you know for well

1584
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:13,000
I can say that he revealed classified
information to me during the worth

1585
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,110
our conversation on and

1586
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:20,989
that mean made it clear that he would
have been very willing to retrieve

1587
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,179
reveal it to others

1588
01:34:22,179 --> 01:34:27,070
was up from the cables or something
totally separate related

1589
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:30,530
to ongoing US

1590
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:34,679
on counterintelligence operations

1591
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:40,070
right and I heard one questionnaire
asking if there's very few regrets

1592
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:45,630
what you did I regret not being

1593
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:49,040
a better friend Manning I wish that
there is some way that it could have

1594
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,000
been done

1595
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,929
both ways our I wish so much

1596
01:34:53,929 --> 01:34:57,230
that he had told me I'm planning on
doing this

1597
01:34:57,230 --> 01:35:01,570
not I've already done this and that
they're out there

1598
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:04,880
and it might still be a possibility
injured it from

1599
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:10,989
I you can't express in words how much I
wish that he had said he was planning it

1600
01:35:10,989 --> 01:35:15,000
and that I could have told them dude
you're gonna fuck your life up

1601
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,520
I'd like to say something in closing and
I'm not hearing any kind capacity to

1602
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,449
pass judgment on

1603
01:35:20,449 --> 01:35:23,830
leave that up to are steamed audience to
do mom

1604
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:28,349
what I will say is this is that as long
as the hacker underground as existed

1605
01:35:28,349 --> 01:35:28,840
we've

1606
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:32,030
always held in very high regard our
neutrality

1607
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:36,170
and has or European colleague pointed
out we're internationalists and we

1608
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:37,730
should remain so

1609
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,900
as soon as you make up your mind to
choose a side politically speaking

1610
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:45,770
you cease to be a hacker

1611
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:50,630
made for for

1612
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:55,300
think way have you not renounced his
citizenship

1613
01:35:55,300 --> 01:36:00,280
know why should because after side

1614
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,550
I was born in this country my
citizenship is on the matter

1615
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:06,929
it it's automatic but your

1616
01:36:06,929 --> 01:36:09,920
you're splitting that here my teeth in
there I think you're changing the

1617
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,469
subject rather easily my

1618
01:36:11,469 --> 01:36:14,940
my the point I was trying to make was
that you had a choice and you've made

1619
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,369
the wrong choice

1620
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:19,790
you could simply walked away and this
would happen I coulda

1621
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:24,480
but I wouldn't have been able to live
with myself

1622
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:29,570
I disagree I heard you the previous
discussion backstage

1623
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:32,860
on closing eyes were thank you guys for
really

1624
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:36,830
standing up and being a great audience
at the other difficult subject a very

1625
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:38,480
controversial issue

1626
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,420
you know most people thought this was
impossible that we couldn't possibly

1627
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,070
have this kind of a dialogue in a civil
tone and listen to

1628
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:51,070
opposing sides and I need come first
serve thank you very much for doing that

1629
01:36:57,650 --> 01:37:01,280
the story doesn't end here gonna keep
following this and all kinds of other

1630
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,989
stories in the future hopefully at that
future hopes and I'm

1631
01:37:04,989 --> 01:37:08,750
all kinds of other things like that I we
have a few more talks

1632
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:12,210
left so please stick around have fun and
on

1633
