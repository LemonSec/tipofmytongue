1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,589
so if I don't make sense please

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,029
excuse me know you

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:15,029
okay fine

4
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,480
should have prolly prepared a little bit
better but I'm up

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,480
a big move him

6
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,230
there's a

7
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,590
at the when doing this presentation is
actually a story based narrative goes

8
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,390
along with this where there's pertain is
that uses a lot %uh the techniques i'm

9
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,260
talking about.

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,289
I'm trying to get some sort of practical
example for these things

11
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,440
um some trying to find a way that I can
read the story

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,810
and have presentation at the same time
but OpenOffice really seems to fail at

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,210
the

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,890
because everything else seems all the
windows just seemed

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,890
go away when I opened up a statement

16
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,490
you need to firms see the screen

17
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:44,490
you

18
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:30,010
and against our final

19
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,459
says Mike working great iight so

20
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,959
make sure they can actually

21
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,120
I thank God thank God okay so I

22
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,540
so the title is talk is lock bypass
without a lock picks

23
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,799
going to explain all that by I'd chose
to talk about this topic in a in a

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,630
moment but

25
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,910
like I said this is a going to be
partially a story based narrative

26
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,239
um but that's a let's get into it

27
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,450
so on before we start into the store I
wanna

28
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,470
first talk a little bit about the topic
itself in myself

29
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,599
just a tiny bit and then talk about the
some other techniques that I'm going to

30
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,130
be

31
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,079
that are going to be used by the the
protagonist so on

32
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:35,049
start of me I'm a security nerd and I
like to think I'm an artist sometimes

33
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,110
um if the story sucks sorry

34
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,780
from I'm not a writer I work for core
security

35
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,760
um if you wanna contact me that's my
email address in my Twitter account but

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,548
I'm boring

37
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,600
and you came here to listen to me talk
about lock bypass and not about myself

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,620
so let's move on

39
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,880
on so why lock bypass without lock picks

40
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,510
lockpicking is sexy lockpicking as fun
their lockpicking competitions

41
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,840
and everybody is really excited about
lockpicking is in the movies

42
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,889
but it isn't really that big a threat
and I know everybody is like no it is

43
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:12,400
but

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,358
really if you get locked out of your
apartment

45
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,570
are you going to bust out your locked
pics okay but that's because your

46
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,849
hackers and it's fun

47
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:29,169
um if you are a normal person you
probably go looking for an open window

48
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,510
oradour that wasn't actually locked or
you might even break a window

49
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,110
or are you my trial hold on to other
things that don't involve lockpicking

50
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,070
and will probably get you for in faster
than lockpicking well

51
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,680
I by picking generally takes a while um

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,660
it takes a while to get good at
lockpicking to the point where you can

53
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,500
open a lock that you've never

54
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,780
never been in exposed to in under five
minutes and

55
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,090
I I like to think that when you're
talking about physical security

56
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,690
any attack the takes longer than five
minutes is too dangerous to really

57
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,500
consider

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,940
on if you're an attacker because there's
a chance at being founds

59
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,919
on under the five-minute mark it starts
to get more

60
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,380
I more dangerous starts to be more of a
threat and the majority of think these

61
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,780
things are going to that i'm gonna talk
about are going to take

62
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,650
less than five minutes to achieve they
are easy techniques

63
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,030
on some other more blatantly obvious and
you might wanna throw things at me

64
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,180
please refrain

65
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,900
unless its a club martín which case
please duke's I would love one right now

66
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,300
on but generally when lock manufacturers
put security features

67
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,650
into their a into their products its to
frustrate lock pickers

68
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,840
or its to frustrate people with bolt
cutters

69
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,219
arm other things aren't really
considered very much

70
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,430
I'm not really gonna talk about brute
brute force you know

71
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,479
cutting locks often things like that
because that's a little bit too obvious

72
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,090
for me

73
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,080
um but I I'd like to point out that that
is a big concern that

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,810
you know cutting off for a hike is
really effective on

75
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,840
anyway so but but security features
mostly focus

76
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,740
on things like lock picking which are
actually threats but because they're so

77
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,950
sexy it looks great for the lock
manufacture to be like nobody can pick

78
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,700
this lock

79
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,890
so on new tumblers

80
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,229
in the same vein don't break all the tax
when you're talking about things that

81
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,960
don't involve actually manipulating
depend on blur

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,969
it just sort of makes sense on now

83
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:32,260
the other that the the big thing there
the

84
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,990
the huge thing and if if you take
nothing else home from this

85
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,700
lock manufacturers determine the quality

86
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,180
of the lock lock consumers the people
buying and using these locks are

87
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,240
determining how the locks are used and
poor lock usage

88
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,440
is just as bad if not worse

89
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,039
than a padlock so take that home if
nothing else

90
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,070
the one big thing is that there's no
need to carry lock picks if you're not

91
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,800
picking locks you don't have to carry
lock picks you don't have to worry about

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,529
the local laws around

93
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,950
owning or carrying lock picks on if an
attacker is discovered

94
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,370
arm they're not going to be subject to
further penalties for having

95
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,169
for having bulgaria's tools are whatever
whatever the

96
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:20,490
terminology is no particular place you
are because these

97
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,050
these tools are legal to owner carry in
some states unless you have a license

98
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,669
which

99
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:28,409
I mean admittedly is really easy to get
can just go to correspondence cool on

100
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:29,419
get that

101
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:33,599
very short time but anyway like I said
before it's quickly learning quickly

102
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,510
performed its

103
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,940
and a five minute mark it's dangerous
and anybody can pick it up

104
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,440
so are the character in this story is a
is Waldo

105
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
his attribute another although is very
hard to find the guy

106
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,940
likes red and white stripes on the van
driver is very resourceful

107
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,750
and as you'll see is a physical security
ninja

108
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,349
so month if the trademark holder for
wall though is in the room

109
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,599
I'm really sorry please don't sue me and
also thanks for coming hope

110
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,760
house it's great

111
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,250
on so let's talk about the techniques a
little bit

112
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,209
so the first thing I want talk about is
abusing ineffective lock usage

113
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:23,950
on now the first bullet is in intensely
obvious and I almost did not but this

114
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,940
on the site at all but son there are
some situations

115
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,940
on certain locks may look like they're
locked but

116
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,979
might actually not be on

117
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,250
this actually might be views to an
attacker if you can

118
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,958
physically enter the premises at one
time

119
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,420
and then sort of but the lock in a state
where it looks lot

120
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,589
but really isn't that might be of use to
you on that actually won a big reasons

121
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,740
why I still kept this on the slide

122
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm one example is if you take a
business card and put it in between the

123
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,149
hasp and their

124
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,550
they're seeing portion at the door frame
fast on

125
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,800
there is as long as the business cards
are the right size the door frame is it

126
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,260
the right size you want people to see
the business card at all

127
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,350
the lock is essentially completely
useless

128
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,130
even if it's locked arm now in some
cases having has pushed into the door

129
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,540
will actually cause that locked be
unlocked

130
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,910
so on that 10 is appear locked but

131
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,550
but there's this you know its there's a
sort a backdoor danger with that a

132
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,480
little bit but sometimes people are just
stupid

133
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
or absent minded so keep that in mind

134
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,540
useless lock placement on we're gonna
seal some examples of this in just a

135
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,709
moment but if you

136
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,750
put a lock on to a part that news

137
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,500
and you can get around this he may be
the

138
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,480
the assets that you're trying to protect
aren't really quite so protected

139
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,890
away if there's a removable part even
even better

140
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,779
again we're gonna see our examples of
this but on another very important thing

141
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,089
is if you're locking a container or your
mounting this lock to something

142
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:02,450
you need to have be very sure and I see
this a lot that you cannot destroy a

143
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,120
disassemble or manipulate

144
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,060
this container or this mounting hardware
to the point where your assets are no

145
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,250
longer protected in this new is a big
concern

146
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,089
arm a lot of times you'll see locks that
are

147
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,220
placed onto something without mounting
brackets

148
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,180
on that are screwed in with screws that
are exposed

149
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,940
so that's cute

150
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,290
so here's an example so this is a lock
placed by a

151
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,790
repo Chi on a a house that was

152
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,110
but that the tenant was forcibly evicted
from

153
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,790
on you'll notice that there are exposed
Phillips head screws

154
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,660
on an attacker would not need to break
this

155
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,730
although it looks like you would make a
pretty easily I'm you would need to cut

156
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,839
the lock you would need to pick the lock

157
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,250
on you can unscrew the screws and take
the bracket of and maybe you have

158
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,730
yourself a new lock to play with as well

159
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,990
um and also new house to play here

160
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,060
um so that's that's also a key

161
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,450
I so his I

162
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,620
yeah I had the same reaction in his
service to

163
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,940
I'm so sweet free dirt bike

164
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,790
um so it it to a a very very

165
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,920
very casual and possibly drug observer
this um

166
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,770
this looks fine but you not be very
quickly becomes obvious when you take a

167
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,310
moment to look at that

168
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,520
it could just be lifted off

169
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,480
on Yu Gi certainly not driving that dirt
bike away but if you have a pickup truck

170
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,210
well you sweet free dirt bike on

171
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,540
so that's an example over where a lock
might look locked but not actually

172
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,719
I wish I had a better example love that
but this is Moses funny anyway

173
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,160
so on here's another day another good
example

174
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,620
on this this looks okay because you're
sort amount it's sorta mounted to the

175
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,430
frame with the u-lock Witcher

176
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,940
little bit hard to break unless you
using liquid nitrogen in a pry bar

177
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,690
bolt cutters or something like that on
the problem is that this wheel comes off

178
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,480
with a quick flick and poll s1 a quick
release wheels that you see on bicycles

179
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,540
frequently

180
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,000
even if it wasn't you could take off the
wheel with the rent sheesh

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,150
and so this bike you can actually right
away and then there's going to be a

182
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,380
u-lock sitting on a

183
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,760
on a bike rack very lonely

184
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,590
on so bye bye basically to

185
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,710
on so this is this is a little it this
is so even though the

186
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,470
under the up lock affixed to removable
part

187
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,600
category on

188
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,900
so so this wheel is very secure

189
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,620
nobody's taking this wheel on the rest
is a bike though

190
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,350
I don't know maybe maybe somebody is
just gotten in maybe they thought a

191
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,440
unicycle was too easy

192
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,400
and this is what they're riding around
but I think it's more likely that there

193
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
was a

194
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,980
a bike attached to this at some point
found another picture I've just a bike

195
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,220
frame

196
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,320
and that was really funny but I I
couldn't justify putting both ends so

197
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,940
just

198
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,350
just visualize that for a second

199
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,590
but anyway so um so again lock the
locketts attached to a removable part

200
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,680
I'll see a lot of bikes that are locked
up in Boston

201
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,140
on also by the way bike theft in boston
is incredibly common

202
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,660
I'm not surprised at in in the least on

203
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,089
but another thing that I see frequently
is our

204
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,279
a lock attached to the bike spokes I
don't know if you are

205
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,720
any of your bike enthusiasts anybody hey
all right great

206
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,240
infinite gas mileage that's great on so

207
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,110
but bike spokes ur you have easy to
break

208
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,020
they're also really easy there's a lot
of fun by school

209
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,020
who I bicycle wheels where you can poll

210
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,460
spoke out without damaging it and then
pop it back in

211
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,290
so it doesn't make sense to lock to that

212
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,810
and finally on

213
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,460
what do you usually done

214
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,740
like that's that chain lock I could
probably chew through

215
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,070
walk is that looks like you bought it at
a convenience store

216
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,500
and and its it just there's no way that
somebody could see this and not think

217
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,020
well I could just left that of

218
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,680
and it's not even like it's attached to
a wheel so somebody could literally just

219
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,220
pick this up and ride it away I know
under a minute's time

220
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,320
self on egregious security fail assigned

221
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,370
um let's talk about shelling attacks per
second

222
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,060
on if you guys to stop by the lockpick
village you certainly heard something

223
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,780
about shaming

224
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,939
if you haven't stopped by the lockpick
village why not

225
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,290
goal or anyway so

226
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,180
shooting attacks basically involves on a
shame

227
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,240
or some something it that that the

228
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,110
most basic definition of a shame is
something that you stick in between two

229
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,720
other things for some purpose

230
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,850
very descriptive on in this in this
particular case in the term move lot in

231
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,290
the %ah since the blocked bypass you're
talking about

232
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,709
changing the way the lock operates by
sticking some

233
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,900
pieces something in between two parts
usually the hasp

234
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,630
and the the receiving portion and a hasp
on so in the case of the Batak

235
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,180
sticking it down in I around the shackle
to push away the Haus Pinto

236
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,570
release the shackle and a sec
effectively make the buyout but the lock

237
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,970
useless are specifically you're talking
about a thin sheet of metal

238
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,250
or plastic or something like that some
rigid material

239
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,370
and I frequently when talking about
locks you talking about targeting the

240
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,660
house because that's really what you
want to go after

241
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,630
this can be done with all sorts of types
of locks padlocks our door locks if any

242
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,760
of you have heard of the

243
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,390
credit card trick that's just shimming a
door mounted lock

244
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,740
on and then handcuffs are also pretty
easy and fun

245
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,270
to him um with the moral high in
handcuffs and an actually with a

246
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,660
with higher invasions have any of these
except the door mounted lot with with

247
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,339
with padlocks and Gus are hiring
veterans have

248
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,890
generally have him protection on Dormont
two blocks

249
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,300
sometimes you'll see a bracket placed
over the

250
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,960
I right next to the doorknob so that you
can shipment on

251
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,290
but oftentimes that's just screwed on as
well

252
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,440
so that's cute um

253
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,920
but with door mounted locks there's a
lot of ways that

254
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,810
you can because this is no simple %ah
consumer to prevent

255
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,370
shinning attacks because the shelling
attacks on door mounted locks

256
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,680
are mostly enabled by the door frame and
how that's

257
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,800
working if the Hindus are on the wrong
side even if they're you know

258
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,640
totally the like melted onto the door

259
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,860
on you can still get are quite a bit a
purchase if you're on the wrong side of

260
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,290
the door trying to shame it

261
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,190
i'm french doors %ah I don't I don't
really know how you can prevent shaming

262
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,020
attacks on French doors because

263
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,660
in even if you put a bracket this tall
on it you could still like maybe take a

264
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,020
guitar strain

265
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,220
skirt a little bit stick it through in
just poll

266
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,339
just sort of Los a little bit with the
time um

267
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,089
so so that's another another really big
concern and shooting attacks are really

268
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,569
easy if you've never Shinda padlock

269
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,540
seriously go to the lockpick behind inch
on

270
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,490
so on so they can do so

271
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,690
here's what a shame looks like on a
padlock on

272
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,420
you can see is just a little piece of
metal from a beer can in this case

273
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,550
on and if you take a look at that the
shackle there's the little receipt

274
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,340
receiving part for the hasp

275
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,970
and basically all you're doing is just
pushing that little piece of metal

276
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,940
I out to keep that's keeping the shackle
in there so you can

277
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,010
bullet right out on

278
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,270
and huzzah here's a little picture of
the

279
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,700
credit card trick is that worship and
adore mounted lock

280
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,770
um so it works in it very very similar
way

281
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,580
to that the padlock Sherman on so

282
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,669
there's some there's a whole class A
blocks called passage locks now passage

283
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,310
locks

284
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,000
are different from most locks in net
they can only be locked and unlocked

285
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,470
from one side

286
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,950
unless there's a fail safe in the case
of like pop button locks

287
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,250
on popup mocks by that I mean the
country's

288
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,560
push the button in and then there's up
though you know when you

289
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,149
to go the doorknob just unlocks itself
for there's a hole on the other side

290
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,090
Rican to stick a screwdriver and it
opens it up in

291
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,889
you can scare the person is in the
bathroom cuz really and I don't know

292
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,360
if you using this for anything except
bathroom and at own

293
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,430
know what you're doing and security home

294
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,780
but anyway so they're not really
surpasses likes the most part in Ahmed

295
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,510
for anything except privacy

296
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,800
a lot of times you see these in
conjunction with normal oxygen be locked

297
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,879
and unlocked from both sides such that
when somebody's on the inside is

298
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,530
something they can maintain

299
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,820
on their presence as the only presence
in the room

300
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,629
on so things like 10 lakhs what you'll
see on hotel doors are the more recent

301
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,660
like

302
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,150
little and I'm

303
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,030
sucks kind of weird I

304
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,550
feel like I'm in fifth grade um

305
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,440
but dumb a lot of these can be
manipulated from

306
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,650
the wrong side again based on lock usage

307
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,930
arm one big thing that I want to mention
up a lot of

308
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,910
RFID sensors on they want people to be
able to get

309
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,610
out so if there's like a visitor who
does not have an RFID card and they go

310
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,340
into the building with somebody who does
have an RFID card is a visitor

311
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,070
and then there are if ID card carrying
buddy leaves

312
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,240
the you don't want them to be stuck
there that's kind of a problem

313
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,850
so what you do is you put a motion
sensor on the other door on the other

314
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,130
side the door which is called a request
exit sensor and their couple different

315
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,500
ways to trigger this

316
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,670
arm one of the best and kinda funniest

317
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,950
is to take a balloon and stick it under
the door

318
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,780
and blow it up and let it go and the
bloomers heightened emotions into goes

319
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,410
hey we can go now and you're like going
in

320
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,800
so so that's cool I like that

321
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,379
um but you find these on on practically

322
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,250
every RFID I there are five the sensor

323
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,480
protected or ever

324
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,660
so that's funny OMF

325
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,100
but you know aside with the problems
I've credential copying with RFID key is

326
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,700
that the motion sent the request

327
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,510
exit motion sensor is a big problem and
it's very easy attack to launch

328
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,900
and you know somebody stops you and you
get detained with a balloon

329
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,170
they'll be like oh my guess is just

330
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,760
a secretly a party clown

331
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,670
or something I don't know um

332
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,130
but but chain locks are are an example a
passage like they can actually be

333
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,929
releasing

334
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,800
easily manipulated through through a
door jamb and actually I have a video

335
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,960
that I recorded

336
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,960
about this on where are you video

337
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,670
that's really really dark but but a

338
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,230
so here's a that's up plastic folder

339
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,400
um this chain lock is really

340
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,500
really old I live in a crappy apartment
building

341
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,130
and this was installed probably at least
a hundred years ago

342
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,530
um so basically the idea is that you
take both sides and folder and you can

343
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,300
manipulate it

344
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:57,310
sorry bending back and forth and you can
not through the door jam with a very

345
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,870
small amount to space

346
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,370
you can actually manipulate the the
chain lock and then

347
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,430
curve it the other way sharply when you
have it in the right position

348
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:12,430
arm and this will happen so on

349
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:19,139
so that's fun com

350
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,730
definitely try this at home its great
fun

351
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,880
um but it's also pretty pretty simple to
do

352
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,290
on this is edited down a little bit for
time reasons but this

353
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,409
attack took about three minutes 30
seconds in total

354
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,210
by cut down by about two minutes again
it's under the five-minute mark

355
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,840
and I A I Rd I had always certain known
this is possible but never really tried

356
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,179
it before so

357
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:52,180
again it's really easy to learn

358
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,780
um so so last thing I want are

359
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,290
may be the last thing I talk about it
alternate point of entry and this is

360
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,480
this is pretty straightforward but I'm
roof access

361
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,590
not many people think about roof access

362
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,850
I am Windows again with the apartment

363
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,730
apartment thing enough people frequently
leave windows unlocked especially if you

364
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,570
talking about

365
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,700
on the second story are higher because
they're figuring while no one's gonna be

366
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,850
on the second story

367
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:35,130
unless they're the latter um or unless
they're on the fire escape now

368
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,060
interesting thing about fire escape
because the fire code

369
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,200
um generally on doors have to

370
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,410
open to be able to open without I any
sort of locking mechanism

371
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,460
from one side so generally you have
something

372
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,450
its somewhat akin to a pass a talk at
circa one a one way door

373
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,810
arm but frequently these have the
problem of

374
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,030
being Schimmel on some door mounted
locks cannot be shamed because the house

375
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,510
pool

376
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,680
actually the has biz is locked in place
when the lock

377
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,770
is locked on so it's not exactly
possible the shame it but

378
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,230
with this type of thing you can't have a
lock do did 22

379
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,700
dude is City Rachael it planning
regulations fire code

380
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,970
on so frequently on fire escape doors
are

381
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,790
are a interesting point of entry the one
thing about that is that they're usually

382
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,820
alarmed

383
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,560
so that might not be a great idea for an
attacker on

384
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,260
when really huge thing is that dropped
I'll ceilings

385
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,420
and raised floors very popular and
server rooms for

386
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,540
on for each fact reasons and for

387
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,990
preventing flooding damage things like
that %uh

388
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,110
the problem is that if you have two
adjacent rooms

389
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,390
both with the top I'll see limbs or
raise floors

390
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,640
there's a very good chance that the wall
does not actually extend to the real

391
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,400
floor so there might be a crawlspace
underneath which

392
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,960
you can completely bypass some locked
door

393
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,840
um so that's kinda funny

394
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,949
on and on

395
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,750
so this is a a grappling hook 25-foot
rope

396
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,200
available on south or dot com I haven't
ordered one yet but one day

397
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,200
on them to get one of these puppies on
that this would be perfect for getting

398
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,020
onto a roof

399
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,820
or on to a fire escape or some I when no
word

400
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,000
just and now being a weirdo I guess I'm

401
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,040
oh yes credentials after copy this is
this is important stuff to

402
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,070
on because anytime you're talking about

403
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,490
um any sort have any sort of key

404
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,260
have any sort on dares always a chance

405
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,660
that it can be copied in some way om now

406
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,190
magnetic stripe cards actually on I'd
say one of the best options

407
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,480
because they you cannot visually I

408
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,090
interpret the the data being used to
authenticate

409
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,790
on you actually have to get access to
the cart or someplace where copia the

410
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,860
card data is stored on so

411
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,740
you need in order to copy on these you
not only need access to the car but

412
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,690
also to a reader so in order to copy one
of these

413
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,350
without somebody knowing you need to
somehow get access to the card without

414
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,160
them knowing

415
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,160
and then have access to a mag stripe
reader which you swipe at 30

416
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,730
and then get it back without them
knowing so that's actually

417
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,190
pretty good I as far as

418
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,010
as far as you know what can be copied on
you can read it from afar like you can

419
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:39,940
with RFID

420
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,590
cards because vendors will tell you and
elsewhere up and down that you cannot

421
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,240
read an RFID chip

422
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,020
from more than about five inches away
and that's simply not true

423
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,030
it depends on the antenna that you're
using if you using

424
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,160
the standard hardware sure yeah you can
read it for more than about five inches

425
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,990
away but

426
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:04,690
I anybody seen the a hacking the Charlie
card

427
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,490
presentation from Def Con no while back
with the

428
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,530
the guys from MIT the one that got
silenced and then

429
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,510
eventually released anyway because that
always happens

430
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,180
yeah so they they built ok work hard and
just

431
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,540
had a hold on to things like a fog
machine they had like a

432
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,110
megaphone they were saying you know we
are stealing your data but they also had

433
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,390
a big antenna

434
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,760
built into this shopping cart that was
grabbing RFID data from all the cards

435
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,900
around

436
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,990
so you could theoretically put a large
antenna like this into a cabinet or

437
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,510
something in some office

438
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,210
and then as everybody walks by with
their proxy card their head cards are

439
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,480
bank car its it's all going to get
captured

440
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,150
not good on the seven cards do you have
a assertive cryptographic protection on

441
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,980
them but that's not terribly common

442
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,620
and a lot of the cards that do you have
a cryptographic protection like the

443
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,870
Charlie card

444
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,210
Inc rapido um

445
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,410
so so enough about RFID stuff

446
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,040
pin tumbler keys are actually pretty
easy to copy to you can either get

447
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,170
physical access

448
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,310
you need physical access to the key on

449
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,409
although you can impression a lock um

450
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,680
it is basically using the properties
have a lock to get an idea what the key

451
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
actually is

452
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,900
on but in terms of just talking about
the keys you can press the key into

453
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,170
some valuable material like clay
play-doh gum whatever you have on you

454
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,750
a gun is actually really great for this
because

455
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,130
to pack of gum you know again you get
caught with a pack of gum in a balloon

456
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,820
and you know and now people might just
think you carry around on things

457
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,129
anyway I so so this

458
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,650
this is great if you have a high
security lock like a medical lock where

459
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,650
you have the

460
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,300
multi-dimensional Arment
multi-dimensional pin tumbler where the

461
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,580
the pentagon had to be rotated in a sec
to a certain degree

462
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,850
on cuz a there's an attack that's
possible on on

463
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,980
one-dimensional peas we can actually
just take a picture of the key and then

464
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,650
decoded visually from the photo

465
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,230
are and we all know how much time taking
a picture takes

466
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,390
and how many a stealthy digital cameras
are available

467
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,370
I think on ThinkGeek their psychic a
pair of glasses that's a digital camera

468
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,160
there's all

469
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,570
as if the later replica that's also a
digital camera there's

470
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:31,000
I'll pulled into things not just think
on but anyway

471
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,240
on so use a blank side I made it myself

472
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,810
on Archer whites in the presentation
yeah

473
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,840
you %uh this is this is the story
Timeslide

474
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,270
I'm so this post say story time but this
is a

475
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,270
this is where I'm carry the story to you
on

476
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,160
so if you didn't read the the lab stack
to begin the presentation

477
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,740
our hero waldo has been trying to
infiltrate the gelato

478
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,880
corporation no relation to any real
company

479
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,310
that's a total sham on

480
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,450
anyway so well that has been club then

481
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,850
thrown in Iran so

482
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,920
days in blurry wallow finally roused
from his drug in blunt trauma induced

483
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,060
nap

484
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,250
his surroundings and familiar on
hardstyle reminded name why he was here

485
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,610
and more importantly wise head hurts so
much

486
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,510
with his arms and responsive to his
attempt to touch what felt like a goose

487
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,730
egg growing right about where the
corporation's goons club him under is

488
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,850
unmistakable red and white hat

489
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,940
well duh noted that they were chained to
his side's which traditionally were

490
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,250
chained to the chair he was sitting in

491
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,120
the bookie engine padlock holding a
train together me to think reigning

492
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,920
sound chorus with the links

493
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,410
as rested exterior brush the chain
tingling is the same to see just how bad

494
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,400
a situation was

495
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,320
well as beginning to regret that the
usual hiding place for his pics was

496
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,250
inside his hat as he determined that his
hands are not going to eat his head

497
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,420
anytime soon

498
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,140
well they could tell that he had been
does very hard given that was with its

499
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,580
were still with him

500
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,659
he wriggled around and tried to stretch
noting that the chain did not seem to be

501
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,650
looped through the rickety chair he'd
been mounted

502
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,030
citing the chair up in of the back at
the aside in a chain open of the back in

503
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,330
a chair might be enough to free him

504
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,610
wildest it up wobbly at first and took a
moment to steady himself

505
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,500
attending the hook the chair on to
handle the door keeping him in what

506
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,130
appeared somewhat ironically to be a
poorly maintained

507
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,480
maintenance closet proved unsuccessful

508
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,950
he began to wriggle and pull the chair
out from the links have chains

509
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,180
after some amount of pulling and tugging
the chair popped out sending while they

510
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,430
went to a nearby wall

511
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,990
months later after shaking the chain
from his torso lay beneath him defeated

512
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,670
and he bobbled medoff being a fan will
see our adventure games

513
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,880
while the reason that the chain used to
bind him may prove useful in his escape

514
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,980
even if only as a makeshift weapons

515
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,590
%ah

516
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:02,270
well as somebody never children reach
for his hat

517
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,850
ship that while though the pics that
wasn't there

518
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,940
at mayor

519
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,240
so on so wallow escape from the chair
because the lockers affects the chain

520
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,460
but the chain was not wrap to the chair

521
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,080
now if the chain was only wrapped in the
chair once or twice he might be able to

522
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,939
break around manipulate the chains that
there is more give on one side

523
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,830
and he could pull it off as header try
to turned upside down and

524
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,169
shake it often on but anyway so that's
an example of the

525
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:40,170
lock not locked problem

526
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,960
while they removed his hat and ran his
hands through his hair in the inside it

527
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,340
had

528
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,680
just to be sure today leon anything at
all study build a mental inventory of

529
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,260
things at its disposal while the reach
into his pockets

530
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,660
something out to get him out of this
mess went

531
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,020
an old receipt Moreland

532
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:11,320
a penny well decide in probe the bump on
his head wondering if he is really going

533
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,419
to make it out of this

534
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,790
green and dusty the room was lit only by
flickering light from an agent for dying

535
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,800
fluorescent bulb

536
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:24,450
there are no windows and only one door
well the jiggle the handle on the door

537
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,240
state only barely clicking in bumping
against the metal frame which was

538
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,920
covered in a sickly green paint flaking
with %eh

539
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,620
pressing against the door frame while
the detailed frame wasn't flush with the

540
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,590
wall it covered

541
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,700
bending the frame would be enough to
allow for manipulation at the hasp

542
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,150
meaning freedom from this dusty
makeshift prison

543
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,720
unfortunately while had nothing remotely
like a pry bar available to him

544
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,400
so this wasn't an option matching the
scenery

545
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,840
a closet skid with a padlock rusted away
in the corner the RAM

546
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,280
running out of options while though
inspected the closet noting that the

547
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,260
padlock noting the padlock and trying to
figure out if you could swing the chain

548
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,260
at it hard enough to break the padlock

549
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,850
upon further inspection while the
realize brute force might just be

550
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,740
unnecessary

551
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,060
the padlock is affixed to the closet
with metal brackets

552
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,129
screen with none other than flathead
ports

553
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:15,199
his fingers get the penny in his pocket

554
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,860
finally a reason came here and pennies
me is too although as he fumbled a

555
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,850
once-great the brackets from the closet
doors

556
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,879
the clink the padlock a

557
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,949
and detached brackets on uselessly the
side as a closet doors creaked open

558
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,428
while the size take it out

559
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,490
a tool belt in that tool belt was a
flathead screwdriver sufficient size and

560
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,590
girth is to be used as a decent private
are

561
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,639
seems those things are starting to
finally look up for Waldo

562
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,260
while the Eagle our eBay half

563
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,740
eagerly approached the door screwdriver
in hand and a smile on his face

564
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,429
witching this could ever between the
freemen door he weathered back in next

565
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:54,040
door with his shoulder popping the door
at for the frame

566
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,529
the door stop short attached to a chain
lock on the other side

567
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,500
while the reached around the door and
jiggled the doorknob disengaging the

568
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,830
doorknobs locks at least he wouldn't
have to deal with that again be so close

569
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,660
to escape but

570
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,109
was at the same time motivating and
frustrating frustration alone however

571
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,910
was not going to get him anywhere

572
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,089
on the other hand because it might have
something to help among the masses

573
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,300
things because it was an old jail at
janitor outfit bearing the name

574
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,740
grade-ii while the thought the Senate
the name sounded familiar

575
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,750
but that the jumpsuit needed more red
and white stripes still

576
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,050
worked as a nice disguise people tend
not to pay attention to cleaning staff

577
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:34,800
and Waldo

578
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,270
of all people knew the value in hiding
in plain sight

579
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,040
at the bottom of the bottle the closet
was a boxer discarded folders

580
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,630
wilder immediately took one other
folders and practically ran back to the

581
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,110
door

582
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,080
opening the door slightly east at the
folder in between the door in the frame

583
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,140
and manipulated the edges at the folder
to curve the the curve the fold around

584
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,080
through the door jam

585
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,069
and touch the tip at the end the chain
closing the door cause the chain the

586
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,070
slide to the side

587
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,140
with a flick in the folder he popped
chain out the door

588
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,379
well above the fold the back into the
room and threw it on the floor

589
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,590
not wanting to go gallivanting around
chill at headquarters without a proper

590
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,150
disguise again he put on the jumpsuit
into a belt

591
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,360
then reluctantly put his hat inside it
he almost walked out without noticing

592
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,410
the chain that he is carrying around
with him and decided it wasn't

593
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,180
terribly janitorial finally while I was
out of the room into the basement of the

594
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,759
building

595
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,930
so

596
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:38,049
up wall there was able to get past the
lost in the cabinet because it was

597
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,980
attached with

598
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,140
flat head screws to a metal bracket

599
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,310
which he was able to open with a penny
um

600
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,640
so after that he is able to use a I

601
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,540
he's able to manipulate the door frame
because it was not flush with the wall

602
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,500
that it was covering sees able to bend
it out a little bit and just simply push

603
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,170
the door

604
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,970
in om then he um

605
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,260
I think the slides rendez I originally
had a shame the

606
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,880
shame that door knob but he just pushed
it in the hands so

607
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,330
undermined group a month but many also
manipulated the chain lock is on the

608
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:20,330
demonstration video earlier

609
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,530
for nearly a week on wall they knew that
the server room was on the second floor

610
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,800
sensing that the delight guns would
return soon while the real Oct a freshly

611
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,950
installed chain lock

612
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:34,030
and engage the lock on the door knob
then hit the elevator call buttons

613
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,640
shortly afterwards the door slid open an
old man in a suit followed by two

614
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,250
muscle-bound thugs stepped out from the
elevator an approach the main in store

615
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,700
as the elevator door close with Waldo
inside the old man disengage the locks

616
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,160
the maintenance room room's door swung
open swung open

617
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,690
revealing an empty overturned chair a
scratch door frame

618
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,940
a piece of chain with a lock on it a
discarded folder

619
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,850
and opened the closet and no waldo

620
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,160
the old man walked into the room slowly
inspecting the mass

621
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,879
suddenly he grabbed a chair and threw it
across the room startling is

622
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,370
muscle-bound cohorts

623
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,660
he looked around to face them a bulging
vein on his forehead

624
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,240
his eyes smoldering with anger lips
twisted into a snarl revealing his

625
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,350
cricket yellowed teeth

626
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,890
shaking with rage he shouted where is
Waldo

627
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:27,890
I

628
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,090
server room Honda audibly from outside
the door

629
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,710
a soft yellowish orange glow emanated
from the LED on the RFID sensor

630
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,640
mall hadn't planned for this he expected
the keyed entry

631
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,040
it's like a three Khans from then again

632
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,600
he hadn't planned to be kidnapped or
drug so eighty

633
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,920
use Rd in something up and improvise a
tional mood

634
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,880
is a pretty safe bet that there is
already going to be there there is going

635
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,300
to be a request exit motion sensor on
the other side at the door

636
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,470
you just be a matter triggering it but
the crack on the underside at the door

637
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:07,160
was too small for him to fit anything
that he had with him through

638
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,609
while the check the frame the door to
see if he could force it open with a

639
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,070
screwdriver

640
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,280
no such luck is reinforced any doubt it
D be able to open it without a car jack

641
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,860
or

642
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,530
some other extreme measure although
tapas what I Italy determined to get in

643
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,610
and thinking about

644
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:26,900
where he could get our copy card to gain
entry

645
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,120
want to look down whereas for it was
making very odd noise and noticed that

646
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,870
the floor is making rather hollow sound

647
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,430
bring a screwdriver to work wallop right
upper floor panel

648
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,649
the floor was raised a quick glance
revealed that the wall the server room

649
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,010
didn't extend past the raised floor

650
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,650
only a half a foot or so space existed
between the wall and the real floor so

651
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,560
while they wouldn't be able to crawl
through without getting stockings

652
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,509
goose egg reminding him that he wasn't
keen on being caught again

653
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,990
although popped a panel out in the
server room for the underside

654
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,890
and tried to wave his hand on the other
side at the door no lock

655
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,009
the motion sensor was motion sensors
pointing to high

656
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,760
he took a pair by scripts from the tool
belt he was wearing and took them up

657
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,590
past the inside the door

658
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,380
a beep sound in the door clicked on
locked while the set up in reach for the

659
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,540
door handle only to find it locked again

660
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,070
right before he could open a it took a
few more tools from the tool belt before

661
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,620
he finally called the door in time

662
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,960
all the steps through in place the tools
back in his tool belt chuckling slightly

663
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,390
at the damage caused to the raised floor

664
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,960
so is a right he said after a place in
the floor panel he pushed up to throw

665
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,680
things to do

666
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,730
while they began the process of textile
textile trading the data with just a

667
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,980
couple quick keystrokes

668
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,480
and grab the backups left carelessly in
the corner just in case

669
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,730
now it's time to Skype app while though
it already been here longer than you

670
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,280
wish to and was looking for an exit now

671
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,630
he dumped a backup center the trash can
in the corner and took out the bag

672
00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:00,630
thinking it would look fairly janitorial

673
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,570
better take the stairs this time thought
while the Sun the trash bag over his

674
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,460
shoulder and descended the stairs to the
first floor

675
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,510
in one direction in the break room in a
hallway to the front entrance

676
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,380
in the other direction is a cubicle farm
and a door leading to a loading dock

677
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,840
since the loading dock seems like a good
exit point

678
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:24,480
he decided he'd go for it feeling he
prolly be fairly unobstructed

679
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,020
he was right stepping out outdoors out
of the

680
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,259
unlocked exit and off under the loading
dock wallet while the star to scour the

681
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,430
parking lot

682
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,950
one cause to doubt the back at the car
smattering bumper stickers which said

683
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,850
things like

684
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:41,850
honk if you like stuff and if you can
read this

685
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,940
it's because you can read

686
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,870
wanna check for surveillance cameras and
witnesses and finding none

687
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,680
started to feel under the car taking
into the front driver side wheel well

688
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,029
while the founda- a hide a key box
actually didn't

689
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,910
so I didn't talk about their getting at
myself yourself

690
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,120
so we got in treated server room because
there is a raised floor on both sides

691
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,759
up the wall and the wall didn't extend
down far enough and he was able to

692
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,510
trigger the remote

693
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,710
request exit motion sensor with some

694
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,260
heavy tools of

695
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,460
so checking in this car while they found
a hide a key box and the wheel well

696
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,970
likely a backup key it fit the door

697
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,120
it also matched to start the car while
that the trash bag into the back to the

698
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,000
car in climbed into the front seat

699
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,480
he took the fuzzy dice offer the mir and
threw them into the glove box

700
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,690
check the mir's secured a seat belt
safety first to know

701
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,890
and drove off into the sunset

702
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,629
so finally um somebody was dumb enough
to store

703
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,359
their backup key their car and Nana the
most obvious place so he could hide it

704
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,359
in the most obvious way that you can
hide it

705
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:00,620
so %ah you know here's a an example of
credential theft because somebody just

706
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,950
didn't put the key in a very good place

707
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,910
so well so that's the end of the story
um

708
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,350
are there any questions comments
suggestions

709
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:20,350
hatred

710
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,870
humph I I took a look at that

711
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,819
%uh a while back arm the XO the
questions we know about rolling codes

712
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,460
for garage door openers

713
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,540
on I know that infrared transmissions
are very vulnerable to replay attacks

714
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,770
um depending on how fast the the codes
role you might be able to use a replay

715
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,910
attack and there's sort is an area where
that's

716
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,220
in use on one not one thing you might
want to look up

717
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,460
is um I think it's called like fun with
infrared IR infrared hacking or

718
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,350
something like that

719
00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:01,350
from a guy named major malfunction given
an old deaf con conference

720
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,920
them

721
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,360
mmm

722
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,770
yes so the there's a there's con for the
German front row here on

723
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,790
there's a a trick that a lot people used
to steal bicycles when there's

724
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:30,650
scared to stop signs where they just
left the stop sign and the cement

725
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,800
because they're not always

726
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,480
cemented in arm another another thing
that could be done in that scenario

727
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,580
frequently

728
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,750
somebody in the past has driven straight
through that stop sign

729
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,430
and so they take a new stop sign and
they bolted on to the old

730
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,240
1 that they cut off the the top of and
frequently you can just

731
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,380
undo that Bolton take the stop sign off
and do something similar

732
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:58,380
site

733
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:06,550
so up in a question

734
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,320
yeah if if it the question was about the
arm

735
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,500
the usage of that the technique for
copying a key visually by taking a photo

736
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:23,980
of it

737
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,530
and yeah you need a you need a good
picture a bit so holding the key will

738
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,190
you try to do it generally doesn't work
out terribly well

739
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,849
it's nice to be able to put it down on
something that gives a little bit of

740
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:34,640
contrast

741
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,640
arm site good

742
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,560
okay on yet so that

743
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,750
the comment was that he's seen this this
technique used

744
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,620
wall the key is in somebody's hand while
they're about to use it about 10 feet

745
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,270
away

746
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:05,270
new tax to work yeah

747
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,270
yeah so so one so up okay so that the
attack

748
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,680
still worked on desk right now

749
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,680
well depending on who you are month

750
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,180
ives i've seen the rubber band trick on
chain locks but that

751
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,180
as far as I can tell requires the door
to be

752
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,440
the door handle to be a certain type
that it you it can pull

753
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,200
they will pull down when you pull on the
other side the handle and I just

754
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,010
I don't think that's as reliable as easy
as that

755
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:56,010
that triggered the plastic folder

756
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,848
use see that's I think the other problem
with the rubber band attack on chain

757
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:16,170
locks is that you need to be able to

758
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:21,280
reach your hand through the door jam if
you only have a very minimal amount to

759
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:21,960
space

760
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,569
if the chain lock is properly installed
on

761
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:29,308
or the chain is short enough generally
that's not possible

762
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:32,180
that's why I don't like that attack
there's actually a gentleman at a did

763
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:32,950
use of question

764
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:39,950
all the time

765
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,910
like I was mentioning earlier on there's
the problem where if you have

766
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,058
a visitor come in who doesn't have an
RFID sensor to get out

767
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:50,569
a knife ID key to get out they could be
stuck there for the night

768
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:54,220
and that's something that a lot
companies want to avoid so yes I see

769
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,450
request exit motion sensors very very
frequently

770
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:03,329
in back yet

771
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:10,329
them

772
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:23,950
sure

773
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:28,790
fair enough

774
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,650
right yet did an infrared security is
actually

775
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,480
gone awful again I'd like to mention
that talk by major malfunction because

776
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,040
it's really killer he talks about the
rolling code he talks about brute

777
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,970
forcing infrared signals

778
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:45,420
he actually owns an entire hotel network
through hotel TV

779
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,170
by reverse-engineering that the remote
control codes just to brute-force

780
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,880
are two very small space to brute force
any at it's great I'd definitely

781
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,350
recommend you take a look at the talk

782
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,670
on but infrared security is pitiful

783
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:05,670
absolutely pitiful

784
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,370
that would probably be better

785
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,480
on you still have the the problem that
that can't be locked

786
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,230
so you start their shipping thing that
is as long as you can put a bracket or

787
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,560
something in place so that

788
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,900
shinning attacks are difficult if not
impossible I mean I don't like to think

789
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,340
that anything's impossible especially
when you're talking about physical

790
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,310
security but

791
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,460
that though I think a push to exit

792
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,500
would be better arm yeah

793
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,750
absolutely in back

794
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,750
can

795
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:47,750
and so I can speak up II stoking a

796
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,700
sure uproot booth the so the question is
how I dealt a lot with brute force

797
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,280
attacks

798
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,359
um I a I don't really deal with the much
because %uh

799
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:04,480
I can't really test that stuff out
without destroying the equipment

800
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,970
and I try to avoid doing that but brute
force attacks are really effective

801
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,810
on I mentioned earlier that in boston
has a huge problem with bike theft and

802
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:18,650
and generally and generally what I see
happening

803
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:23,150
is all brute force attacks on chain
locks you can't buy them without getting

804
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:23,560
your

805
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,299
boxed on because people come by with
bolt cutters or they'll for liquid

806
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,339
nitrogen on the

807
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:34,200
on the chain and then NHA and then prior
it's much more common than you think

808
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,820
I I don't know how else they would do it

809
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,210
on ness what I've heard from most the
people who generally deal with like this

810
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:44,880
and so what

811
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,450
I'm honestly not sure about how they
actually applied liquid nitrogen

812
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,940
but down yeah but

813
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,700
the but it really weakens the crap out
of pretty much anything

814
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:05,700
self

815
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,160
um well %uh I know someone the

816
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,170
summer the alarm the so the question is
is there any way to

817
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,820
to bypass a fire alarm on a on a fire
escape door on

818
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,099
I know a lot of the or at least some II
once a lot cuz I

819
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:26,960
actually don't know that for sure inside
I wanna Donna property false information

820
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,920
about a care but

821
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,119
um a lot of them work on the same
principle as some others burglary

822
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:35,250
alarm locks where there's just to
magnets

823
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,369
right by each other and that sort of on
you know as long as there's still

824
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:43,560
as long as they're close enough to each
other there's there's a circuit that

825
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,799
that gets affected by it that moving
away

826
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,010
and so that triggers the alarm on its

827
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,750
there's a sorta magnet shaming attack
that works on a lot of those where you

828
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,520
can still

829
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,099
keep the a keep that sorted in place
because they're

830
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:04,460
date you know arm second keep the alarm
from triggering an

831
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,170
in certain circumstances um other than

832
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,609
you know it's it's it's similar to one
to

833
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:15,009
working with tamper proof seals where
you're trying to prevent

834
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,700
some sensor from going off on so

835
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,470
if you if you take a look into that
there's actually I think there is a talk

836
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,770
its new con this year

837
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,619
about tamper proof seals and how they
all are terrible

838
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:30,890
and suck and Dom and what a better
solution might be

839
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:34,500
on an interesting talk I definitely
recommend taking a look into it but that

840
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:34,920
might

841
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,730
and looking into that might give you
some more clues on how to had a

842
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:45,730
go further in testing

843
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:55,788
but so is it is their chain lock where

844
00:52:55,789 --> 00:53:00,180
a the middle can pick up with a bolt
cutter or grind

845
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,599
mmm I see you

846
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,319
yeah if you had to if it is made of
diamond maybe

847
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:10,799
I mean theoretically anything can
eventually be broken with enough brute

848
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:13,650
force that's a great thing about brute
force is that if it's not working you're

849
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,799
just not using enough

850
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:18,170
on so on

851
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:22,499
so in in terms a brute force attacks
they will always work if you're using

852
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,869
enough brute force if you have a big
enough said a bolt cutters if you have a

853
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,509
diamond diamond tipped grinder on

854
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:36,509
whatever you're talking about enough
brute force will work

855
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:50,810
sorry what

856
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,910
are

857
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:55,920
yes that's right on

858
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,430
I think it would depend on the placement

859
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,869
I mean I think most the attack city
could prolly launch on that would be the

860
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:05,809
sort of thing where it's not installed
properly

861
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,420
I mean if you have that bracket
installed at the bottom of the door and

862
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,769
the door knobs right in the middle %uh
the door obviously it's

863
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:14,549
you know you can see %uh that's not
going to work um I can't think of a

864
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:18,369
a good way to to bypass and otherwise
except maybe using a if the door

865
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:19,039
frameless

866
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:26,039
to really should eat maybe like a the
guitar string thing I was talking about

867
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,098
yet yeah i i I mention that earlier in
the talkin and and basically you can

868
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:37,690
up visually decoded by sorry measuring
the distance in pixels

869
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,569
on and a seeking get an idea that the

870
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:47,788
that he the other words completely
skipping the %uh the

871
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:53,890
the the way the key is shaped we

872
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:59,848
betting the key betting Thank You Think
You deviant um

873
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:06,849
another personal question

874
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,209
so the

875
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:15,579
you

876
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:21,890
no not exactly on okay on so is dis this
has been last question

877
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:25,400
and being told times out I'm so the
question was about about copying a key

878
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,660
that you need to take it

879
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,950
a picture both sides and you have the
property the problem the key blank

880
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:34,630
up key blanks are readily available as
long as you know the type of lock

881
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,390
on you can fight you can figure out the
key blank really easily

882
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:42,719
it's information that anybody can look
up pretty much regardless so far what

883
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:43,690
type of lock it is

884
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:48,130
that's actually not a problem so what's
so thank you everybody for coming
