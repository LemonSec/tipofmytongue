24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,320

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,060
i'm aware. I used to be a hacker I still

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,070
and I am if you need any help give me a
call and this is

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,500

phone calls of my life

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500

so I have multiple clients name bottom

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,060
but the one that I thought would be the
most useful public service announcement

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,840
will be a talk on employment law

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,690

the universe around us technology making
things do with they weren't designed to

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:43,970
do

45
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,810

51
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,329
and are a few stories through are few
kind of ideas from the other side

52
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,930
the people that hire us and how to keep
yourself safe had a keeper

53
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,630
self-interested and employed

54

somewhere else

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm probably making stuff up I

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,780
do I have never worked as an HR person
in my life

60
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,959
I do read the emails for a living

61
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,850
it's a really strange shop I'm a
professional four-year

62
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,660
I'm not saying that they're stupid of
hypotheticals of course based on real

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,200
people

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,329
and I'm obvious getting them protect the
guilty

65
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,989
okay I many is a few terms

66
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm going to mangle them out we had a
definition of hacker

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,590
curious person interested and stuff
alternative

68
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,940
way of looking at the universe and then

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,089
the others the ninety-nine point nine
percent

70
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,130
the population you say don't mind coming
covers I'm going to have a conference

71
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,780
tonight

72
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,669
who your cue

73
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,400
from Mike change my credit rating no

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,550
so

75
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,530
how to be a few hackers evil computer
criminals where hair black T-shirts

76
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,930
well if you if you did show up anyway
you are not to be trusted

77
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,850
you not to be trusted around clients
you're not to be trusted around

78
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,870
computers

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,199
you aren't be trusted around anything
it's really interesting my same going to

80
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,270
hacker conference

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,530
I'm fixing a computer even aware I
always get asked that

82
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,780
Antico you can't touch it anymore why
you trust me before for

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,580
anyway okay there are some legal terms

84
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,789
adverse employment action this issue
this

85
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,669
something paired that happens to you and
your relationship to your employer

86
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,260
it can be as limited as emotion it can
be firing

87
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,010
it could be a failure to hire I'm

88
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,599
employment agreement this is still a
little piece a paper you get when you

89
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,710
first started Java

90
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,520
this is not necessarily a contract
there's a difference

91
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,359
employment agreement is here are the
rules by which you work

92
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,690
none of this is binding on us the
employer

93
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,490
you don't do this with fire you we don't
do our side

94
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,379
you can quit employee handbook

95
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,560
that's the bigger more general stuff
that game these are things you shouldn't

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,590
do and I do on a daily basis

97
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,220
anyway just kinda ok them arm for cars

98
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,009
is this is a discharge firing for a
breach of the employment agreement

99
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,099
okay

100
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,128
at will employment this is the rule in

101
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:13,949
every state in the United States lawyers
were often same

102
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,250
its 31 your state and most states and I
hate re went and looked at the laws and

103
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,330
all 50 states Montana has a modified
version of it so

104
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,818
if any if you are employed in the state
montana arm

105
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,090
ask me later how this is different it
really is a

106
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,479
arm the rules are y'all can break up at
any time

107
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,520
you are not married you are min

108
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,000
may be going steady with your job your
employer and you

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,620
either if you can leave at any time

110
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,280
for any reason including stupid ones

111
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,360
are given incorrect ones I heard

112
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,460
you stole a car one across state lines
in West a 12-year-old

113
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,840
now that was a my coworker amp find you
anywhere

114
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,669
are no reason at all I'm hi five units
workgroup

115
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:10,250
I can six not so fast

116
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,129
as the wrong as said reason is not a
legal one

117
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,409
here what to say there are six employees

118
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,300
five white guy someone who is not a
white guy

119
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,870
we fire the person who isn't now free
for them because

120
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,889
81 awake I that's a legal if we fired
because well

121
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:35,889
just cuz we wanted to that's okay it's
proving the difference is the fun part

122
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,960
okay there are some exceptions to at one
point

123
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,270
I'm employment contract back

124
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,780
change it that says this is not an will
environment

125
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,879
I'm usually if you can if you do have an
employment contract

126
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,030
they will say this is at will which
means either of us can say

127
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,379
up your skin some states oddly imply an
employment contract

128
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,270
make good-faith bargaining but
massachusetts but

129
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,370
I don't really understand Massachusetts

130
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,740
I'm also if you you may also have a
contract with your employer that you

131
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,530
a you independently did not right are
some if you remember the Union

132
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,580
I'm if you are a member of the civil
service

133
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,969
if you are in halkat they making you
have tenure

134
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:29,830
okay cell another term wrongful
discharge

135
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,750
this is a much more limited thing than
most people think

136
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,690
I get numerous calls from people even on
hackers who are

137
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,630
I had de Soto's never like me they came
in they said I was fired

138
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,120
that's wrong I wanna show for no you
can't

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,650
for you can actually if you pay me now
file frivolous lawsuit I'll happily do

140
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,890
that for money

141
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,220
are for bite it doesn't actually prevent
you from being fired

142
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,820
they can still walk you out the door I
it gives you the right to sue for your

143
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,580
damages

144
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,630
if it really was a room for firing
however

145
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,140
it's much more limited if you were fired
because of your race

146
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,510
sex religion aid if you're over forty
our sexual preference in certain states

147
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,319
now usually I get the question wiping do
we have to document all this bullshit

148
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,760
about the employee doesn't perform

149
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,180
this is because this is the HR
department thinking

150
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,650
I'm the documentation every incident
sure showed up late nineteen times

151
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,910
as twenty days at work are

152
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,189
you've done your job so badly we're
going to give you a performance contract

153
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,730
negotiations get closing up when a
coworker my got a performance contract

154
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,670
it had like about this

155
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:45,300
and them he was gone up trafico maybe I
don't want this

156
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,190
okay another way that you can be
wrongfully fired

157
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,130
is what we call whistleblower protection
this is also much more limited

158
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,630
if you as an employee working for

159
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,750
your employer and you see something
wrong

160
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,140
big brown capital W wrong spear deep in
the tree of life

161
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,790
I

162
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,760
thank you somebody's got that right you

163
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,030
say wait a minute you know I'm we work
at a nursing home

164
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,819
have noticed considered giving them
partnerships with giving them cyanide

165
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,100
I'm

166
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,900
something tells me that's wrong rate you
go to your boss and say

167
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,120
arm cyanide is not an approved

168
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,100
fruit substance they can still fire you

169
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,430
you have to go to the requisite

170
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,530
I'm governmental are on

171
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,569
if there's like a exporter whatever and
go to then you Brad out your company

172
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,070
then you're protected odd because I
would think you as an employee here

173
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,070
would like to know would like to be able
to to

174
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,450
have employees rack them how because
you'd like to know before

175
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,580
you know before the cops go hi I'm

176
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,580
cyanide not a Persian doesn't taste like
there's also this weird public policy

177
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,420
think it's pretty limited to

178
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,579
actually doing criminal axe are
retaliation for civic duty

179
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,530
namely jury duty of a case in Irish
retreating for prepping this K

180
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,120
this site talk like Halak how many
people get fired for going to jury duty

181
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,300
evidently a fair amount okay

182
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,230
how do people feel the world this is
Adam

183
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,450
Manish had a disclaimer I'm in no way a
sociologist

184
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,710
I married 21 which means that I am
bombing oppressor

185
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,990
but nonetheless okay

186
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,400
hackers and how count myself under them
rules

187
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,270
bureaucracy their things that get in the
way of fun

188
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,220
hear the things that get in the way of
actually getting what I'm supposed to be

189
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,090
doing doing

190
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,360
and also you know that more

191
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,470
ice find issues faster just because I'm
I I do with this job

192
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,590
if I what doing this job noticed that
the job that when you guys doing

193
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,890
is doing it badly here you've missed
misunderstood something

194
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,170
I should jump in angola K do I'm don't
do that

195
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,709
do it this way will be better a better
outcome pets

196
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,830
you know better very hacker nature the

197
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,730
K I've got a burning you've got
instrument let's put on a show

198
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm new

199
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,090
also add fresh eyes always find the
flaws you know

200
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,200
you've been working something for three
weeks someone else walks in case on

201
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,470
there's a problem I'll how so obvious
now

202
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,780
however training

203
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,699
is boring how many people don't like
occupational say

204
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,430
safety training works like fire will
burn you for

205
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,730
okay I remember getting this one work
for pharma company its

206
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,000
to use the virology lab don't bring in
food

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,040
okay that seemed obvious to me

208
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,800
okay anything yet to actually need to
know

209
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,880
is out there there's a man page for it
if there isn't you have to write one but

210
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,110
there's a poker there said

211
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,610
you know how I hope you go out and find
it so I'll start doing once must be

212
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,310
doing before actually know what I'm
doing

213
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,150
that's the way to do it okay I'm

214
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,199
the HR approach and I also want
employers Chris we are trying to think

215
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,080
the same way

216
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,500
compartment was Asian keeps safe hi

217
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,680
don't let you do the thing that I don't
think I want you to do

218
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,020
nothing can ever happen we have policy

219
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,270
we have procedure if we're following the
policy in the procedure

220
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,860
nothing bad will happen if you go
outside the box

221
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,480
there be a group risk-averse

222
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,790
to the nth degree hmmm

223
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,630
explaining probability to lawyers really
really hard to

224
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,880
the chance that this what actually
happened is so minuscule

225
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,370
but we have to break you can sit in case
it happens I'm

226
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,450
I once actually seriously try to sell
someone look

227
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,270
robotic shirts like there is a chance
this could happen well

228
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:22,110
but the cost dude its joke it is a scary
world out there

229
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,570
you can get sued for anything that's why
we hire experts

230
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,410
trust the experts that's what the
experts

231
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,079
because they're experts you have to
trust them even when they're mistaken

232
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,830
even when you're also qualify could be
one

233
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,190
I remember them personal story

234
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,210
I discussing this with a few other
people it

235
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,100
electronic discovery company where they
said well you can't say that

236
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,580
it was some your point if civil
procedure and supply and RAM

237
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,070
I'm also a licensed attorney I actually
kinda know this stuff I to take like

238
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,380
casten for three days sick for well

239
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,570
but they know what they're doing said
why

240
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,600
okay shut up and just go back coloring

241
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,510
okay Excel you our employer

242
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,569
how many people here are on have work
it's so sad man's

243
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,290
our network security people or something
else like that raise your hands

244
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,439
okay how many if you view your users not
as

245
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,490
people but individual risks all they
wanna do

246
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,580
is fuck your shit up

247
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,920
they're not doing work they're coming up
with new and unusual ways

248
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,730
the fuck your shit up

249
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,120
phrase

250
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,040
guess what HR looks at you guys the same
way

251
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,790
HR looks at you and guess so if you are
going to sexually harass your workmates

252
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,360
so if you are going to get drunk and run
over someone in the parking lot

253
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,770
for out guy come up with

254
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,100
the British are trying to think this
might like well we have no person

255
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,490
what if they spontaneously combust

256
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,530
are insured for I don't know we need to
do due diligence

257
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:18,670
so you as hackers when you come out to
the classic your employer and say

258
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,290
I am a hacker they instantly don't go

259
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,520
oh wow someone who we truly energetic
and creative

260
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,500
know it's Mike got up with this person
to us

261
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,790
that gets behind didn't get him sued
they could be embarrassing

262
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,260
a cat thrust us into uncertainty

263
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,240
okay there's a massive acronyms out
there

264
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,960
I'm sure some if you'd seen its

265
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,080
gramm-leach-bliley Act hey perhaps Sox
Korea at crae that said

266
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,870
what keeps her credit rating safer
something like that

267
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,710
arm how many how many if you have made
money off of one of these by saying

268
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,750
this has to be kaliya compliant her arts
SOX compliant

269
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,970
and on I knew I know consultants have

270
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,030
mm I don't know this but I'm sure some
console at some point said

271
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,359
this I'm this power strip is

272
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,510
SOX compliant if that's what I first

273
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,859
good on them but we're from you know

274
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,330
employers an HR people and lawyers who
aren't me

275
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,889
I'm look at this Google my god weak
division ruined

276
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,310
I don't know what it means so we have to
spend money on it expert

277
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,490
details that were okay because I'm
relying on the expert

278
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,080
I'm just because they're worth it there
actress for her

279
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,830
doesn't mean it doesn't scare disc
basico that disclosure sensitive data is

280
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,879
bad things

281
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,920
cuz your hackers your evil people who
want to get the secrets

282
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,789
and Mike I now but Twitter

283
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:03,100
arm ironically most of these are kind of
truth was hacks

284
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,019
because the only people that regulate
these are the fit

285
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,220
they're busy the perceived you know
doing whatever they do like

286
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,279
the SEC watching porn rather than you
know it regulating

287
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,129
wall street or whatever but because
individual people can sue for

288
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:21,340
I'm you put my credit report and

289
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,840
my medical history on Twitter I'm now we
can sue for that sorry

290
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,309
didn't find the counter punchers America

291
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,678
cell however you can get sued for

292
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,710
hacking at work wiretap

293
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,759
on actual damages profits or a hundred
dollars a day for violating 18 USC 25-11

294
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,649
I'm stored Communications Act if you in
for a few weeks someone else's email

295
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,200
that stored on a server

296
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,369
that's also a legal and not much a fine

297
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,408
I'm factor is the

298
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:59,669
think that's also credit reports I'm

299
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,509
private cause of action for negligence
or willful disclosure

300
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,789
I don't know your damages are but aren't
you

301
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:11,450
week information about a person that you
have your hope their data

302
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,269
say for example your insurance company
you leaked information

303
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:19,909
back now there's something embarrassing
about them they wanted to ensure their

304
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,999
guild collection

305
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,379

308
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,989

okay

320
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,529
embarrassment this is actually a bigger
fear I'm

321
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:17,340
it causes to school work in the
corporate checked

322
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,369
knowing secrets

323
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:25,399
I mean who here who was Ben assist man
has not booked through

324
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:28,899
I don't know the shares looking for
anything interesting: at eight

325
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:32,080
Minister I know I'm I can actually

326
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,519
met to discuss this action patience past
I remember writing a script

327
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,909
that them heard anything out of the
print queue

328
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:44,279
if it had the word layoff in it for

329
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:51,279
I'm that worked really well elsa mostly
to find out which

330
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,999
a my really problematic and users would
get laid off so that way I could like

331
00:20:56,999 --> 00:21:02,179
walk their stuff at you see now I'm
attorney

332
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:06,039
I'm also think things like tell him

333
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,330
%uh if you were say you get credit cards

334
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,509
in your business and you end up in
datalist be

335
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:16,149
here making the nightly news you know
losing customers

336
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,609
loans lower in stock prices that this
might come out there

337
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:24,779
but that's like your

338
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,149
sorry I'm involved in I'm okay

339
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:32,080
uncertainty this is really where you can
screw things up because you guys

340
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,178
when you look at stuff you

341
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:39,109
you may make the powers that be have to
change what they do

342
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:42,379
if you point out something wake

343
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:47,679
hey were completely on security yes
artwork doing this completely broken

344
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,210
gambino now they actually could do
something about it

345
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,690
and it makes them have to think makes
gets mad at their box

346
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,369
no cost a lot of money on effort and

347
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:04,139
if people who are you know web vice
president or president ur

348
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:08,200
see something I'll win their main in
their titles and a champion this it

349
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,830
makes them look stupid which is formed
worse than actually losing money

350
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,080
okay

351
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,549
so enough ranting about skip the people
I'm gonna get a couple case histories

352
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,279
and these are people who were hackers
who had jobs

353
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,730
an let's see how things played out okay

354
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,230
them Vinny works for IT consulting
company

355
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,039
you've heard the company he is a

356
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,230
he's a security analyst his job

357
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,539
is to get circuit to come to Europe
public place of employment can go

358
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,158
yes this is adequately secure we have
audited and it's all OK

359
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,230
he also goes to a hacker conference

360
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:56,010
this is a hacker conference where
there's a lot of alcohol served

361
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,940
I'm why I hope there's a discussion
about

362
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,789
some aspect the physical security he
points to help back

363
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:09,129
1/2 his company's clients I'm isn't
really doing something correctly

364
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,030
because the club wanna clients employees
is also there

365
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,720
and their talking for pierced my hey you
know this is kinda broken

366
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,299
I'm promises another it can be

367
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,840
at the conference was listening in and
here's many say

368
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,980
I still have access to your stuff

369
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,270
I no wonder am on your on europe

370
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,700
on your project so I should not have it
but I've tested an

371
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,190
home the other candy for example

372
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,059
complex a couple calls from

373
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,379
and 12 anything calls me and says um

374
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,590
I'm in trouble what I get when my

375
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,860
try to help them through it and he's
actually

376
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,740
he's working can't sell but for what I
was kinda scary extra wait a minute

377
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,190
you've

378
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,200
you behind being a hacker conference and
talking about security

379
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,380
with someone who should know about it
gets him

380
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,730
check its kinda wrong because you know
from my point of view

381
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,409
if I wouldn't wear I would like people
to tell me when I'm doing something rap

382
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,750
I'm can highlight criticism except for
my wife

383
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,570
because I never write back okay

384
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,240
another story Ralph brown of is home

385
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,100
routes one of those people that you call
me when you call an ISP

386
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,700
and Nate ask you stupid things like is
it on

387
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,260
and have you rebooted

388
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,340
n yet you think that the reason why
they're asking you that

389
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,928
is not cuz if a flow chart mccue because
they do have a flow chart but

390
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:51,460
they have to ask ninety-nine percent the
people that will actually help

391
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,260
but ralph is curious ralph is also

392
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,890
forward history ambitious

393
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,200
he notices a security hole in AM

394
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,730
an application work that brown it allows

395
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,750
any one to obtain of the HR information
like Social Security numbers

396
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,000

397
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,700
he its kinda bothered by this click this

398
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,990
if we're doing this when but also be
doing wrong

399
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,990
you place with it for a while

400
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,120
says I think I know what the problem is
I think I know the extent of the problem

401
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,590

418
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,140

so she's the go to Cal anything from
there's a printer jam

420
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,260
I can't get online emails broke and

421
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,690
we're having a new employees start about
stopping at the tracker actually in this

422
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,020
case

423
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,470
chill traits she security aware

424
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,820
but the security people people like
CISSP after their name

425
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,320
are in the main office for serious so
you may be one of them may be in this

426
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,570
room but nonetheless

427
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,850
on sue the West campaign I'm interested

428
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,480
stuff I you know I'm gonna do my job
better I'd like to go to the main office

429
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,360
maybe

430
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,149
and she also knows as well because we
have a credit card transactions

431
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:28,659
their serum there's a way I can obtain
credit card information

432
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,990
over the network we on the network

433
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,010
maybe yeah the internets and via the C
series of tubes

434
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,970
I can grab credit card information it's
not in cryptic since both what I'd like

435
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,470
to think it was that bad thing

436
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,940
unfortunately

437
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,590
companies in bad bad times the
headquarter staff

438
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,200
when she kinda reports that some kinda
catches the security team

439
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,179
flat-footed by saying where last we're
passing credit card information

440
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,260
plain text over the Internet guesses

441
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,158
bad I'm is there a way we can fix this

442
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,500
and there's some time a critical but a
pissing match no it isn't here's the

443
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,020
trace

444
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,710
you know I've I sniffed what's that look
like that with a credit card number

445
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,659
looks like Monday

446
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,909
I'm however rather not very good
security

447
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,740
they are good hack

448
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,919
going to the HR people powers-that-be in
basically every frame it and make it

449
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,600
look like

450
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,799
she's the one who caused it not she's
the one who noticed

451
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,809
and sell so who is calling me saying

452
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:42,809
com can you help me negotiate like a
settlement package

453
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,950
except of course that I change name to
sue because those

454
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,350
talk about medication didn't change it
later called said but none

455
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,649
sorry okay bombing clearly outplayed

456
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,780
taking New Jersey Transit up your own
thinking that this last-minute not good

457
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,520
enough

458
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,559
okay Bob works as a contract employee
for a law firm

459
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,240
not security curious at all doesn't care

460
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,260
it not really even not hacker all

461
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,549
inadvertently clicks in the wrong link
in the outlook I

462
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:16,710
webmail interestingly enough this
company uses

463
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,840
outlook for everything like

464
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,480
I've never seen a database function in
work that would let you do

465
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,450
what resumes they do Mike I for

466
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,470
thats we're but hey

467
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,549
I'm has global access to sensitive data

468
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:39,399
like every contract this law firm has

469
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:42,780
with another company I'm

470
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,908
other people better-armed

471
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,290
their hourly rates I'm

472
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,928
what they're paid child support payments
like just

473
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:57,549
just this information be really really
really humiliating to get out there

474
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:01,270
and he just click like for well I I
clicked on the wrong thing

475
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:05,750
of a sudden shutdown someone's child
support payments

476
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,630
com informs the security-conscious

477
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:15,230
coworker Park our color

478
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,409
Bowl are

479
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:22,460
basically does everything wrong instead
of

480
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,970
kind of soft pedaling it to the powers
that be to say hey

481
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,169
I'm I have some curiosity do you mind if
I take a look at this

482
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,330
old look what I found instead said

483
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,730
security-conscious coworker jumps up
place with it

484
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,270
and decides as a joke on

485
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,540
for imagine

486
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,540
cousins one bit where they would hug
that that that the fight the

487
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,360
kind of the database where they
determined who would get hired for

488
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,669
projects

489
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:55,690
so this that sorry this
security-conscious coworker namely me

490
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,700
says well I think Alex will be the only
person in this database

491
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,559
so that way if there's any job effort
comes up my resume pops up first

492
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,210
I make that joke for when that person
Factory heading up the project go

493
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,809
I think they should we should fix that
some icy want me hired for every project

494
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:17,200
from now on including ones that I'm
completely incompetent

495
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,309
do I actually don't get fired

496
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:28,158
i think thats pure luck I would not do I
would not recommend doing this at all

497
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,179
okay next story tracks

498
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:38,659
she has hired its first public support
she is how a very proud hacker

499
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:43,050
on she's going she's inside doing tech
support for customers

500
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,960
of the one other products that this
company does

501
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,260
it's something that you don't want the
information to get out there

502
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,360
really strange way of distributing the
information me

503
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,470
it's basically dumping large amounts
financial data

504
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,429
onto DVD's that the ship via postal mail

505
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:04,580
and on these DVD's are several thousand
to maybe twenty to fifty thousand

506
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,928
transactions

507
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:10,440
so including things like routing numbers
bank numbers

508
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,730
I'm all the information coming back this
week I

509
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:19,190
information theft I bought mine on these
DVD's be awesome to have to skip

510
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,480
and its crew credit cards these are
actually bank back

511
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,139
these are bank statements bank routing
numbers wire numbers

512
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:29,639
I imagine you could turn this into a
fairly lucrative business

513
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:34,770
for I'm for customers are concerned
about security

514
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,030
DES this information is actually send on
encrypt it because

515
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:44,600
no one ever loses postal mail

516
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,879
I'm so they're like well we're gonna fix
this

517
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:51,350
and the promises that its okay now we're
sending the

518
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,820
in cryptographic keys unfortunately

519
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,480
they don't work when they get into
customers hands so the customers then

520
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,820
saying well we have a choice we can
either get security

521
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,649
that doesn't work or we can go back to
the old system which is insecure but I

522
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:09,540
should let us do our business

523
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,210
journalists comes up with a solution
like I've got a different way we can

524
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,110
crypt this

525
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,119
its I think she described as like it's
auto the crypt things that sounds like

526
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,809
it's a good execute about that

527
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:26,350
packages it so it's it gets a good stuff
are want this on their

528
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:31,050
thank you I'm sorry being internet right
now really really slick slick solution

529
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,428
she comes up with this idea goes to a
Boston says I would like to test this

530
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:39,659
have one customer what kinda sold on the
idea

531
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,050
and everybody's happy she still employed

532
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,840
I'm she's actually like now I cannot
senior something something something

533
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,970
engineer

534
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,159
so she's no longer on helpdesk

535
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,940
which i think is probably what many of
us who can help desk but really want to

536
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,129
do

537
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:03,290
okay basic basic takeaways

538
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,590
this is one of the few times in your
life that better

539
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,859
for permission is to ask for forgiveness

540
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:13,918
I hate saying but it's true

541
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,049
better yet get a rethink your job
Description If You can.

542
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,359
I wanna back at work I wanna play
security can I have my job description

543
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,469
changed

544
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,319
that way when you come to me and say
humor screwing around with no

545
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:30,020
my job

546
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,330
or if they're not going to be that much
fun hmmm

547
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:39,449
kid basically just a document that says
this is cool

548
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:43,969
document everything it do

549
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,159
permission what you did who you talk to

550
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,010
in case things get funny which they of
ink because you

551
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,319
and the reason I say this doing it
writing rather than doing

552
00:34:55,319 --> 00:35:00,040
or early is invariably what they think
they agreed to

553
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,900
and what you think they agreed to art
different and you never want to get

554
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,960
called into HR

555
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,910
have to explain that cuz you lose

556
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,680
okay say for example in

557
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,770
you screwed up are the employer screwed
up

558
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,310
and you're now like ok got I am gonna
get fired

559
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,049
now what because it's not over when you
get fired

560
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,100
I mean can you give us from been fired

561
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,779
by now thank you okay

562
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:38,780
first step be very careful what you
agreed to everything is still negotiable

563
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,130
if it is time to go you you either
you're gonna get fired

564
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,190
are have to quit because they're gonna
do something ask

565
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,660
like they're gonna basically slander
your professional reputation

566
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,270
first thing while you're smart they
still have stuff they

567
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:58,270
one from you and you have stuff that
they that you need from them

568
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,350
consider getting a negotiated letter of
reference

569
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,490
it's far better to do this now open it
is coming months from now

570
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:11,220
so that way you can still put them on
your resume

571
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,940
I'm this is a nice or touching non
disparagement closed your separation

572
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,690
contract that says

573
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:22,660
you not speak ill of me I won't speak if
ill if you

574
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,410
on you don't contest my unemployment
compensation

575
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,009
I'm an agreement to consult with
transition this is a common one

576
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,240
if you are if you've got something that
only you know how it works

577
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,400
are even something as simple as

578
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,080
only I know the passwords to these 8
things

579
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,920
oftentimes that's what they would like
I'm better yet

580
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,799
negotiator where he can their

581
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:54,600
I know friends that actually makes more
money being fired

582
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,240
have actually working for the company to
get phone calls back

583
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,589
at good friend of mine I'm I hate him
because

584
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:08,790
get this together flying to San Diego
February in Boston Michael yet i'ma sock

585
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,279
yeah that that's just a meet that system
we built they're still maintaining

586
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,369
I'm the only one who knows but you could
get like three months ago I know but to

587
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:17,660
take Asian

588
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,109
hate you

589
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:24,680
don't get cute don't get stupid I'm
don't do things like

590
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,868
I'm going to leave everything on the
hard drive I'm that my laptop that you

591
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:29,900
gave me

592
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,890
%um be be absolutely fucking
professional at this point

593
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,940
because it's gonna it's got working your
benefit later

594
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,480
but don't let them get cute with your
property

595
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,850
they wanna do something like taxing this

596
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:48,130
I'm we wanna on it all your personal
Systems in case you have customer data

597
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:48,900
on them

598
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,100
now a certified there's no customer data

599
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,299
if you want to build your forensic image
give it to you

600
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:59,799
and you have to send it back to me in a
week just a protest it to your happy

601
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:04,730
but don't let them come still on a PC if
there's any intellectual property

602
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,190
that you're working on that you think
you might own

603
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,010
negotiated out at this point

604
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:19,010
okay any questions

605
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,510
right um it was interesting he said not
to wipe the hard drive

606
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,520
because is Michael

607
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,790
you you said not with the hard drives
before you get back

608
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,420
corporate property I've actually made it
personal Paul's to do exactly that

609
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,680
I'm multiple customers I'm not sure
what's on hard drive anymore

610
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,759
I just south of it I'm I would get
permission first

611
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,470
in only this causes a great case called
I'll a CV citrate it's a great fuck you

612
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,150
have a case

613
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,930
I keep this in class cuz it's one of
those I'm

614
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,520
basically what happens is this guy works
for a

615
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,420
out real estate developer he has a
personal laptop he decides there's some

616
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,470
property that I want to develop

617
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,730
I'm gonna use my work laptop to take
notes he gets fired

618
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,950
party quits he sends back the laptop
it's been

619
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,300
the level form company decides

620
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,310
you're going to go off in your own and
develop property

621
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,770
screw you we're suing you for the family
you it costs

622
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,780
to hmmm how

623
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,220
what's the that that to a friends again
image and even to

624
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,000
undelete the files send it to grow on
tractor drive safe urges sumbody

625
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,200
to attempt to recover this because you
did not have permission

626
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,930
to delete that big because once you
start working on your

627
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,710
own you ceased being an employee of ours
even though we stop page you and

628
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,160
therefore was unauthorized

629
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,390
access under 18 USC 10:30 to do with it

630
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,680
to delete those files that's actually a
criminal act

631
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,770
evidently they couldn't get the uski US
Attorney tip to agree but

632
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,820
pistol shoot 'em and they bring so
generally

633
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,050
if you're if if its work it works laptop

634
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,300
they own it don't do anything personal
on it don't do anything that

635
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,360
is on your side business or anything
else so that way you can honestly say

636
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,010
everything that issuers is back and Doc

637
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:29,010
your up

638
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,930
interesting okay

639
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,589
go see you are also for posterity
working to swap drives

640
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,780
you you work for ever from your own
personal drive I'm

641
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:56,030
their internet bill payment their
property isn't just the drive

642
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,940
the property is the intellectual
property that you have created while you

643
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,750
work for them

644
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,800
on that drive I don't think because it's
it's not like saying

645
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,920
I'm gonna bring in my own desk therefore

646
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,480
any other files on the Desktop mine
doesn't work that way

647
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,609
I'm not sure

648
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:17,098
I will think on that and come back with
a better answer than interesting

649
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:22,090
here why would they want to agree to let
them

650
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,720
audits my personal laptop that you
mention slide

651
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,330
I'm okay that was a special case I'm

652
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,440
said person was kinda afraid because
there's a governmental

653
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,380
agency involved and there was

654
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,450
a possibility that the company

655
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,190
would instead of incident handling
income leave would have just gone to the

656
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,530
agency and said

657
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,280
this guy we have me is my belief

658
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,470
Holt you were potentially classified
information

659
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:57,390
that would be a bad see because that
turns a firing him to

660
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,170
a search warrant no one wants a search
warrant executed at their house

661
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,000
and it wasn't very very slim chance that
this would happen

662
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,400
but it was enough that rattled my client

663
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,839
and it kinda got me a bottle took well
at that's nasty shit

664
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,950
let's see if we can work something out
the actual never took the forensic image

665
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,570
they actually backed off a bit

666
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,970
but it was a kind of a like a let's toss
that went out there

667
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,830
so that way you could say this is stuff
I've never worked on client stuff

668
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,279
on my personal stuff the only time I
heard Unidos on my hard drive

669
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,640
a mic hard drive of my personal I'm in
my work laptop

670
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,080
so here's proof that I never get place
known

671
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,490
go further a you mention this

672
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,040
to his character soo hoo was like a 90
percent and

673
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,890
didn't she was kinda it seemed the
insiders gotta work to some degree or

674
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,670
another but didn't

675
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,230
kinda say weathers with cooler not
legally or whatever

676
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,900
me I'm taking your be that type so

677
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,190
the fictitious character senior she was
like a general IT person who

678
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:03,770
and Mike found some security thing and I
don't remember hearing you say well

679
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,400
here's what happened: her or although
I'm sorry on

680
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,640
what happened soo was the one finds a
security hole

681
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,330
she actually scammed because the company
kind of

682
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,509
I the the the security team at the HR
department

683
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,300
are there headquarters sorry if you're
not a trainer can attract a man says

684
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,750
she caused the flaw so and because she
didn't have security in a title

685
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,960
she is kinda she's not be expert in each
others eyes

686
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,560
get with the person who expose touch the
floor it's kinda shitty moved but

687
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,140
most that was book you know it got
dangerous even though she was helping

688
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,220
company for

689
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,230
unfortunately not on because each

690
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,340
she was fired I should they actually

691
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,540
they kinda vote as she was laid off
which she was arm

692
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,810
so she was able to collect unemployment
she was

693
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:01,130
able to go and get other job she was
excused from any non disclosure not an

694
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,460
explosion on competes

695
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,800
so she's pretty much free to go an they
could have fired her for a bunch of

696
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,690
different reasons

697
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,920
instead the disco I mean well they could
have claimed anything

698
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,310
but because they clean this that was
just lay off rather than were firing

699
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:21,200
for cars it actually made it better for
her and

700
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,460
question about a term over here in the
middle okay

701
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,130
for people for an attorney say no we
live in a right to work state

702
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,180
what is that me because you know this is
going to give me a good answer

703
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,750
I'm yet right to work

704
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,370
om remember there's there's

705
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,850
Terry I'm drawing a blank as I'm gonna
have

706
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,670
can't remember the exact terms here yeah

707
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:52,470
they can fire you for ever

708
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,840
think if okay

709
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,990
on at work I mean at its at will
employment

710
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,950
and fried right to work is they cannot
force a union upon you

711
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,180
so if the union shop

712
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,669
action there's no such thing as a union
shop you do not have to be a member of

713
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,390
the Union

714
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,339
I you don't have to accept union
representation for example the people to

715
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,000
send me an email one of my employer's
Temple University

716
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,760
I actually have union representation it
does fall for me

717
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,630
by it's there if I wanted I cannot
choose

718
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,800
to not pay arcane I can choose to have

719
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,330
someone else negotiate on my behalf that
same screen right to work

720
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,900
and well line yes

721
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,770
some states are right to work some
states are not

722
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:50,450
I'm not I mean union law I that's it
that's a weird specialty onto itself

723
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:54,290
I'm I'm are you gonna speaking like that
the fifty thousand foot level like

724
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:00,650
some allowed some dull my work requires
a minimum term at Topsham

725
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,790

I'm not employed by them I am a
contractor taken fire meet anytime

763
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,960
you can find me because I'm white its
okay

764
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,970
of course they would have probably known
that once they talk to make

765
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:41,970
you know my god practically sober any
other questions I i mean I'm

766
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:50,140
blinded here so it's like really clear
headlights if

767
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,960
if you work is in IT departments for
sysadmin you have passwords the funding

768
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,120
fired or leaving the job for whatever
reason arm

769
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,549
what should you do other than just
notify them hey I saw a password

770
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,800
especially if you realize your password
is still active whatever reason

771
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,170
you accidentally logged in you had some
script that was running whatever reason

772
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,860
you realize your password is still there

773
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,890
but UK what you doing complaints

774
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:16,930
way more interesting cuz I mean I'm

775
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,180
there's a great article on how to fire
sysadmins I'm

776
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,180
when I mean it's a problem cuz you

777
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:27,569
if you are in the position to hire sys
admins eventually you may have to fire

778
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,020
them

779
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,730
I have been a part that cleanup crew I'm
where it's going well come help before

780
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,140
they

781
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,890
realize in case they screw something up
deliberately arm

782
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:41,589
so say for example you do I you know you
do what a a mature adult sysadmin should

783
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,100
do cuz

784
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,050
your applications more valuable than any
other asset you've got is to

785
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,090
like here's all my passwords have a nice
day

786
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,370
I'm our if you noticed that the password
to have changed

787
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,710
it would be helpful to let them know
that

788
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,010
your security still broken the problem
of course is why did you notice

789
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:07,540
you know like did your dresser mocked
why are you in my house

790
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:12,509
mom it depends on the level for poor you
have with the company

791
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,520
if they fired you because if there was a
screaming match

792
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:22,680
ship got thrown don't ever mention come
again if you're on still good relations

793
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:29,680
I'm it would probably the safest way
would be to use

794
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,590
intermediary I mean the absolute you
know complete safing is

795
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:38,150
to retain an attorney who would then say
a client of mine

796
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,210
happens know something about your
security would you like this information

797
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:46,440
I'm thats I'm not recommending that you
call me

798
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,680
like I have passwords now

799
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,080
I think I wonder what are the advantages
of up hiring lawyers that way you can

800
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,700
just have

801
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,260
completely bizarre conversations
hypothetically

802
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,510
this this and this but

803
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,660
if you'd still know someone there you're
still

804
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,960
friendly in you don't think that it's
gonna get turned around into

805
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,320
you know bob was hechinger systems
notice that he still could

806
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,380
if there's some way you could come
across as not completely creepy would be

807
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,270
the best way

808
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,300
otherwise is keep your mouth shut okay

809
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:28,300
thank you so much

810
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:35,350
think it's

811
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,150
for
