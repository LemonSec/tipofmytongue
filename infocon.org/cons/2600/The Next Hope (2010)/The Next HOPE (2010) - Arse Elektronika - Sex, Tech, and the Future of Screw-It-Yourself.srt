and Gary goat see in your heart

113
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:45,440
Gaza the human to testicle race you has
always been nearly 121

114
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,990
Ars Electronica started in to 2007

115
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,280
I we had the idea a couple of years
before that but we didn't find we

116
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,139
couldn't find a venue to host it because
nobody wanted to post

117
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,110
as sex in tech conference so finally
thought about why not doing it in San

118
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,840
Francisco I mean you're waking all the
time they're so

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,070
their silicon valley's round the corner
let's do it there and actually that was

120
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,659
a good team up so we started in 2007

121
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,280
and the topic it was renovation Anna

122
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,479
we started the the movement

123
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,490
in dungeon of pink dot com you might
know king dot com did win bdsm porn and

124
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,280
stuff like that

125
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,660
and the used to have like the SoCal porn
palace

126
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,229
it was a BDSM dungeon witty shot most of
their

127
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:31,340
a.m. nasty little videos and

128
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,229
it was the first time an academic
conference was held there so it was

129
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:35,389
pretty okay

130
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,639
%ah some people would it was pretty good
a pretty good crowd of people attended

131
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,699
the to see the talks in the
demonstrations and some people couldn't

132
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,199
believe there I is a

133
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,560
I checked out this nice anal probe it
was

134
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,000
comfortable and

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,940
you know why is the Holy Bible their I
tell you why

136
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,550
because the first ours electronica was
dealing with probation

137
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,990
that means the history of pornography
sex and technological innovation and

138
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,430
that's

139
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,419
very very important because none of the
shit you use nowadays

140
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,430
would be there without pornography or
smart

141
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,889
the first things that were printed %ah
by gutenberg

142
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,370
after he printed the Bible was erotica
okay and he financed printing more

143
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:25,930
bibles

144
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,370
with erotica so the Holy Bible and I
mean is a spoiler Jesus dies on page six

145
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,799
I really wanna pay

146
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,839
I the Holy Bible

147
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,069
yeah %ah is closely

148
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:43,049
related to sex technology %ah the stuff
like

149
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,180
the Polaroid camera the first Polaroid
camera was caught the swinger

150
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,260
and you can imagine what was called the
swinger in the sixties

151
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,970
because they were targeting the amateur
porn market because nobody actually

152
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,880
especially in the states you know
sixties nice nobody wanted to take like

153
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,620
like porn pictures are naked pictures of
his wife or something

154
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,959
and then bring it to Walmart then please
develop it for me so

155
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,430
there was a certain target audience for
that but before that

156
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,680
I mean in the late 19th century when a

157
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,690
photography became really really
important are

158
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,970
the what there's a case of the guy is
like a doctor from London

159
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,470
and in a single house raid be rated
thousands and thousands of pornographic

160
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,819
images in the from his basement

161
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:29,490
are because it was illegal back then it
was just like five years

162
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,010
after the first introduction art after
photographic camera to the public

163
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,860
audience

164
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,980
so its re pretty much right there was
the first

165
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,270
films ever shot was kinda like it porno

166
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,329
kinda thing but we go on I mean in the
1970s 1980s when

167
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,980
a the tape markets grew bigger and
bigger and bigger

168
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,410
I mean one of the reasons why the VHS
tape became so important

169
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,670
estate dominant form of videotaping not
there

170
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,939
far superior video 2004 met that was

171
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,079
pretty much we we we better then VHS

172
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,440
one reason was the the point market
because the

173
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,520
trial my well my license agreements
above applied it costs money

174
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,079
lets jus VHS are

175
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,490
we have many many many many many things
like my dad

176
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,720
bought the VHS recorder and player

177
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,560
because he wanted to see born that's it
your

178
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,000
a but you have to consider many many
people

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,360
balce video cameras to and the rest is
nice

180
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,800
little home video magazine from the
nineteen eighties early 1980s X-rated

181
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,149
aesthetics the year's most libidinous
tapes

182
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,820
by whoever Gary getting sis if he's here
please raise your hands

183
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,040
a so

184
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,079
pornography sexuality technology

185
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,100
and do it yourself where interconnected
all the time I mean stuff like that see

186
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,290
you see me

187
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,380
broadband internet all that she would
not be beer it wouldn't be like a tone

188
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,930
dial phone system

189
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,410
a if like all the sex telephone

190
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,660
operators like sex telephone call
systems blah blah

191
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,380
in the nineteen eighties he couldn't
handle all the callers so the needed

192
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,709
far superior systems and that's why told
are kinda

193
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:23,230
was introduced the same with brought
that et cetera et cetera et cetera

194
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,360
so the first Ars Electronica was dealing
with the history

195
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,430
a sex porn and technology and high
striving

196
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,380
innovation a but the it's not ending of
course there's stuff like sex machines

197
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,470
we see one here %ah but also

198
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,540
you may consider that a if you think
that

199
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,969
pornography is stimulating technological
innovation

200
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,670
of course we live in a patriarchal
society and of course it's a

201
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,610
header sexes point of view because may
own mainly to seventies sixties

202
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,459
eighties of course demean consumers
remain they were actually

203
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,829
longing for having cheap access to
pornography so

204
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,170
people at all the stuff but in the
meantime there's actually an interesting

205
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,420
thing happening

206
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,310
a because nah ladies a we see

207
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,320
that fine more and more women actually a

208
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,380
are also getting into this whole thing

209
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,550
and its interesting to see that the sex
a

210
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,240
a fucking machines market many many more
a

211
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,760
women are interested in for example
building something like a

212
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,310
sex machine a fucking machine adventures
like 10 years ago

213
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,339
so there's something interesting
happening a

214
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,690
why a am i showing a guy a good friend
of mine

215
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,060
pumping fake sperm into a cocktail glass

216
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,709
we did the first ours electronica
because we wanted units

217
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:46,589
of technological innovation a unit of
pornographic technological

218
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,970
innovation and its 72 buy it at 72

219
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,100
we took a random DVD store in

220
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,959
San Francisco or and we counted are all
the DVD steer

221
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,250
and then be kinda calculated I'm me how
many DVD's

222
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,810
how many cumshots how many liters of
sperm

223
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,450
are in DVD store and it's 72

224
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,940
seventy two liters of sperm in a
standard DVD store

225
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,320
and I'm talking about DVD seeger I mean
could you imagine how much sperm is in

226
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,079
the Internet

227
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,160
we don't drive it would be the perfect
apocalypse like drowning in sperm your

228
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,730
are so

229
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,970
good people like Mark Perry who is a
great cultural

230
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,370
philosopher spoke at the first Ars
Electronica so

231
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,060
I'm not talking about only like bullshit
going on about fake sperm stuff like

232
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,399
that

233
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,339
with a couple of really interesting
speakers there he was actually talking

234
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:43,839
about

235
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,120
sex technology and war and how that was
inter

236
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,200
connect its we had people like this
sleazy guy

237
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,610
rich Gibson who was talking about TPS
and sex

238
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,779
%ah and we had successor

239
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,269
fuck silver looks like hoop

240
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:04,160
John if I if and forecastle it was built
by the same guy who built

241
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,420
Johnny Five

242
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,230
it is not building sex machines and
probably makes a living from that

243
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,420
that's pretty okay I yes sir a we had an
on-stage

244
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,649
and I had a bet with a friend twenty
dollars

245
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,720
not even in San Francisco someone is
going on stage in having sex with the

246
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,269
machine and I lost

247
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,730
a that

248
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,980
someone got up on stage and had a couple
a female ecstatic lesions on stage

249
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,250
there in front of sorry I'm burping I'm
that

250
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,350
actually feeling like if I talk about
female ejaculation I purple the time

251
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,980
sorry

252
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,839
I'm so it was very interesting

253
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,570
a of the bed having many many a talks
about like third wave feminism and stuff

254
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,170
like that

255
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,450
because it's quite interesting I
mentioned before

256
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,450
more and more women are actually into
sex machines some women I know and there

257
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,680
isn't an interesting study out there
says

258
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,899
that some women would rather have have
sex with a sex machine that with a man

259
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,430
which is quite interesting because from
Internet from a feminist a point of view

260
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,760
and third wave feminism

261
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,870
it's almost like a an interesting choice
to meet so

262
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,490
I mean in the meantime another I'm not
like I don't have to choose a guy come

263
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,070
on yes

264
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,089
sweaty and smelly in why not doing

265
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,420
some other things and some packets
business out there actually have

266
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,790
interesting small the DIY workshops of
building your own sex machine is pretty

267
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,360
easy

268
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,240
the stuff is so steampunk it's just like

269
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,579
it's very easy up but then again there's
lots of technology in the air that could

270
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:38,300
be

271
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,470
like helping to a find new ways to do
that

272
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,250
so pronto Asian I was the first theme of
ours

273
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,260
electronica and in fact if you're
interested you can but I am so no where

274
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,089
else

275
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,339
%uh stupid capitalist companies Darrius

276
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:58,440
a reader an essay reader anthology about
all the talks given

277
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,550
at the first Ars Electronica about
probation I have

278
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,579
one copy here with me the second

279
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:11,389
Ars Electronica worse do and what sleep
with electric sheep

280
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,260
because talking about the past and
talking about sex machines and a

281
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,449
possible future

282
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:19,820
it was almost clear to talk about sex
and science fiction

283
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,880
and technology and what ideas are in
science fiction

284
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,949
that are interesting for sex tech

285
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:29,060
a for sex tech future a

286
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,570
in the United 72 it was the first a
science fiction reader ever presented

287
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,570
eros in orbits about Joseph elder

288
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,850
a collection of short stories about sick
science fiction short stories that

289
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,470
specifically future sex

290
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,829
or pornography or erotic on very
interesting

291
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:48,100
but I mean you'll know hurts most if
you're main

292
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,730
a what do we have out there I mean
there's stuff like UFO

293
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,899
from the early 1970s is like Gary
Anderson

294
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,519
the the UFO series I mean it's quite
herro

295
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,160
a sex is to see i mean why would someone
like work in the moon base like this

296
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,168
I i don't know except like selling
copies of of the TV show but I don't

297
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:07,800
know

298
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,888
but let's go on I mean their stuff like

299
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:14,389
Battlestar Galactica and Bella
struggling to get a new one not the old

300
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:16,260
one the old one is pretty much like a

301
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,260
mormon indoctrination you know that's

302
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,530
I the guy who created to first
Battlestar Galactica credit because he

303
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,349
wanted to have

304
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,540
a science fiction story storyline along

305
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,570
more Mon doctrine so it's pretty much
like

306
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,939
up it's based on Mormon ideology the
first one

307
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,179
not the letter won the letter one is
pretty much like about screwing robots

308
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:43,200
all the time yeah screen robots and
ripping guys eyes out

309
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,770
that that's what it's all about %ah it's
quite interesting to see

310
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,270
and how the deal with this whole
philosophical tile Mr of like we are

311
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,629
we are fake the fate we are not fake
we're human we are not human

312
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,659
what do we do how do we love how do we
have sex it's quite interesting to see

313
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:02,800
a but their things like

314
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,850
you know well play drama I mean some of
the younger nerds might not even know

315
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,610
Blade Runner nowadays

316
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,220
but directs the conventions of like a
people dressing up and feeling hot

317
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,649
about being read replicants or I mean

318
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:20,179
see what you can do with him a

319
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,690
a its it's a small as key porn

320
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,159
based on that the S key Star Wars a

321
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,130
worsen I I'm not telling you more Google
for yourself

322
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:38,130
came in the year 1992 we had 12 first
virtual sex scene on screen a really bad

323
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,449
Thomas a film called The Lawnmower Man a

324
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,350
I mean the whole film is so bad I mean
you can see Tron ID's and it looks cool

325
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,360
but this one

326
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,720
use I mean it its its it so bad it's
like it 3 pixel

327
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,600
were whatever a but interestingly was
the first time the public

328
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,700
got introduced to this idea of like
dislike

329
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,720
cybersex and mmm what could it be

330
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,000

alien porn mu why not

332
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,600
there's render porn out there and so
many people who do not have access

333
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,750
to shoot their own porn or are have so
crazy ideas about sexuality

334
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,549
a that they want to create their own
vision of sexuality

335
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,950
and I mean somebody's out there really
has these like crazy idea of like an

336
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,330
alien should rape a woman

337
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,080
why not I mean he did you know it's out
there I cannot unsee it

338
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
a and

339
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,440
well read the porn is pretty much an
interesting

340
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,370
liberation for people have crazy idea is
to just like bombard us

341
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,710
with them up why not a who

342
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,320
you know the game split a bar yes

343
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,049
sport is the biggest platform for penis
creatures in the universe

344
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,549
appear all the people who played spore

345
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:01,460
I mean I'm not sure if anyone play sport
right now but it's so it's so like nine

346
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,490
to Nala what was it like 2010 a to
something like that I don't know where

347
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,000
but all the people went into sports at
all I can make read a bit

348
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,870
interesting great perfect I make one
with a giant penis

349
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,919
all I'm so bored I go away and this is
like

350
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,360
there's so many like like lonely penis
creatures

351
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,660
in sporter all my go pick them up I
don't know do something with them

352
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,730
but it tells a lot about what people
want to do

353
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,100
I mean I'm not saying yet okay

354
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,490
to make it simple mankind is a tool
using species

355
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,460
and a sexual species and we can not go
beyond that

356
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,740
even tho if some of you might I've never
had sex in my life I should forget about

357
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,559
the whole thing

358
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:52,910
know you will never our so

359
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,980
daters kissing the Borg Queen kinda lame

360
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,059
but are it's getting better

361
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,210
all know what local terminator

362
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,679
why not I mean we're talking about
techno hedonism here so I selectronic as

363
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,900
about techno hedonism

364
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,890
and about how we can use technology to
have a good time I mean why shouldn't

365
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,360
like robots have a good time n

366
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,419
there's a whole interesting a

367
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:20,660
SC in the book for ours electronica
number two

368
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,350
about six and science fiction about the
interesting relationship between

369
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,799
I mean what is artificial intelligence

370
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,770
I mean we will not no if something is
really

371
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,820
artificially intelligent because most of
the time

372
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,389
a people like intelligent beings

373
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,900
at don't let you tell them what they
should do so if it

374
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,299
for me she would be really intelligent
it would stop working

375
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,340
a but maybe it would start fucking knows

376
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,399
a so

377
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,520
there's an interesting aspect
intellectually philosophers dealing

378
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,120
with interesting idea of like
reproduction of machines

379
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,320
and how they would do that and how you
could enforce machines to reproduce

380
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,210
because of colours machines

381
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,400
meet might like it so maybe if we could
build

382
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,140
in interesting sup routines that makes
that gives a profit to the machine to

383
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,480
reproduce or whatever

384
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,700
I mean you're talking about it
completely Darwinist thing here

385
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,200
there's so many other ways my people
would enjoy sex but still

386
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,350
I mean it's out there and people are
doing research about it

387
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,380
or on of now I its its

388
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,309
it's just to ahead %ah

389
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,629
that's what happened in roswell I

390
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,440
no at now ice as keep that one other
that's a nice ones

391
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,380
me I had I had a good time with my
friend

392
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,600
stormtrooper yeah

393
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,890
there's nothing sexual in this image hmm

394
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,789
strange all

395
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,629
no actually like it turns me on a

396
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,390
the basic question is what is the future
of pornography and sexuality

397
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,179
I talked about the whole idea of sex
machines and what they could do

398
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,320
%ah but there's also a whole die mention
are for

399
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,559
virtual sex virtual sex pots
possibilities and of course

400
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,649
which the facts a good friend of mine
erin was asking was talking

401
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,130
a about the strange ID your of

402
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,750
pornography and a updating

403
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,280
pornography let's see a that's when the
porn

404
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,760
most definitely but that thats ya the
salsa

405
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,879
kinda like Nazi read the point whatever
it is %ah

406
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,549
all all not of gay men fighting against
persons

407
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:41,570
interesting You're

408
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,158
why am i showing you that's because you
see I mean there's a slight difference

409
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:47,220
between the two images there's lots of

410
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,659
but effects are like projected onto the
image

411
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,330
and I mean there's that guy and

412
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,449
%um uniform uniform officially next one

413
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,669
you see it's like of course visual
enhancement and

414
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,280
suddenly the guy looks a little bit
younger because the used for one of

415
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,740
their

416
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,799
x-men films state the needed a younger
guy

417
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,260
the you'd be needed a a younger
stewart's a so

418
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,770
the same here I mean it looks pretty
okay

419
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,830
and if we talk about the future of porn

420
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,059
and a friend a porn they will merge

421
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,139
there's no doubt there will be pointed
future that's

422
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,990
realistic that's for a realistic and you
can't even tell a difference

423
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,919
if it's poor like a real actor or not
reelected just a couple of years

424
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,730
I'll tell you a I mean

425
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,110
stuff like that happens all the time
amina I don't wanna

426
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,150
I mean don't think about government sex
or eating fish

427
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,340
but its Justin imager

428
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,070
people can do stuff like that I mean
most of porn is highly routine

429
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,730
it's just like you know they're like $5
different ways to do porn

430
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,110
and ejaculation that's it it's pouring
your

431
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,500
I think the future of porn a because it
will be way easier to produce it

432
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,440
digitally will be we in more way more
interesting because it would be easier

433
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,390
to produce it

434
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,059
it will be more sidetracks of poor not
only the boring

435
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:17,539
had a sexist mainstream porn there will
be so many side

436
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,970
porns are it will be really interesting

437
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,279
our I mean its 10 percent pixels and I
mean look at the tentacles

438
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,360
the I mean some actor

439
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,690
hasn't had sex who

440
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,330
whatever Lolita our why am i showing you

441
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,090
Lolita the actress I don't know her name
do you know your name I don't know

442
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,809
a it was like the remake of the liter
and

443
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,428
the problem was and that's an
interesting the

444
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,440
that mention of porn and moral values

445
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,600
a she was under 18 so she couldn't be
filled make it

446
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,419
but it's a really important part of
Lolita you know how it like being naked

447
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:03,909
having sex with an older guy in stuffy
and the book of knew what he was writing

448
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:04,710
about

449
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,289
so how could date deal with like this
really

450
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:12,820
talented young actress but they couldn't
shoot short haired her breasts

451
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,230
what they did is like the pretty much
like copy paste it breasts

452
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,210
are for if the man who was over 18 onto
her

453
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,840
and that's an interesting wall all my
gods I mean okay

454
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,570
she can show breasts but we can show all
the breasts on her

455
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,600
interesting let's do that and if you
like

456
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,960
I mean and just its it's a moral deal MI
nor

457
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,539
but the whole discussion about child
porn

458
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,169
I mean is it still child porn

459
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,220
if it shows a child and it's completely

460
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,409
naturalistic but there is no child in it
because it's completely rendered

461
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,539
so we have a stranger future our flight

462
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,320
different areas of child pornography and
possible

463
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
like illegal stuff out there I'm just
warning you what might happen

464
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,340
%ah I mean typical film budgets you see

465
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,010
and he to see where the pornographic the
this

466
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,190
I thats

467
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,110
that's the fact that mean a couple of
porn movies out there who were really

468
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,380
really expensive like the Pirates one
which is

469
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,650
by the way really funny at the same time
a are

470
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,950
and its but like

471
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,850
good producing porn a will be WAY
cheaper

472
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,289
in the future and that will kick off
things you will not be able to imagine

473
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:37,090
including me %ah so to Android sleep
with

474
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,630
Electric Sheep only will be desperate
that's right

475
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,970
and I see some desperate faces here I

476
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,350
I was electronica the second a wanna

477
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,120
including a couple really interesting
short stories so it's not only

478
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,159
a reader with like a like essay stuff
but there's also a couple of really good

479
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,950
science fiction short stories in this
one soul Rudy Rucker

480
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,440
Cory Doctorow you know the Steampunk I
and a couple other

481
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,029
people a you see current IRS circular
Donald Tom Roach

482
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,340
the violet blue I'm not sure how you

483
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,730
think about the whole by that blue thing
but whatever she's in there and

484
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,600
good are and

485
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,520
I'm introducing you to a concert not
that might be interesting for you:

486
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,220
because every time but ours electronica
we started in 2000

487
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,909
and to 8 we introduce the concept of the
pre

488
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:36,330
Ars Electronica so we want to introduce
the general audience

489
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,460
too interesting sex tech related
concepts fucking machines some more

490
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,049
guess which owns whatever

491
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,460
a and this one here the guy

492
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,740
the guy's name is any he is a French guy
living in Japan

493
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,799
and he created a machine like a

494
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,110
he created the machine that a software
program

495
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,279
that's connected to a a dildo or
vibrator actually

496
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:05,029
and it only vibrates in to cases like
it's two different machines the first

497
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,690
machine

498
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,070
only vibrates if they're is a pretty

499
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,678
be sent Seesmic activity somewhere on
the planet

500
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,100
so if there's an earthquake the deal
starts

501
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,390
because it a serious are for
controversial bill does because he's

502
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,149
connecting sex and death

503
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:25,880
so if people die somewhere in Haiti

504
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,029
damn hun

505
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:32,610
and it kinda makes a strange click in
your head if you think about that

506
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,380
the second one is actually vibrating if
there is civilian body count in Iraq

507
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,429
so if the US military kills people in
Iraq

508
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:45,220
yeah and it was sitting there on the
table

509
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,740
and buzzing and buzzing and buzzing

510
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,630
and it made me sick and it was good am

511
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,080
we also have machines there kinda like
like this one its

512
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,830
I I wouldn't write it's kinda hard but
some people are into it

513
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:05,960
a this is like giant one part of this
like sex machine is like giant speakers

514
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,980
and it's actually pumping sound on to
you so it's not only like this picked

515
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,169
the classic your sex machine kinda thing
if you're sitting there as a woman today

516
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,200
it's also like this was a male version

517
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,429
%ah but it's pumping sound on to you
it's almost like like infrasound it's

518
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:22,380
very very crazy

519
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,190
but some people like it there actually
people out there and there was a study

520
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,049
that some people only can the orgasm

521
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,809
if there's a certain frequency in the
air so certain basis something like that

522
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:34,330
so

523
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,750
a some of you out there be

524
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,240
who might have a problem with that
specifically I guess night I'm not

525
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,779
talking about that

526
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:47,630
tried to sit next to your speaker and
play around with it and use an equaliser

527
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,640
something I don't know

528
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,039
a good thats David find a good friend of
mine he's also a sex robot he's on the

529
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,279
25th century and he came back

530
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,820
to meet us a in 2009

531
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,779
we talked about intercourse an
intercourse

532
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,779
the basically was sexuality genetics
biotech

533
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:09,390
what where a body modifications

534
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,309
and especially especially talking about
that and the gender problem

535
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:16,340
the gender problem is most of porn most
have sex

536
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,960
tech is targeted a to Manor

537
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,600
that doesn't mean that sex machines are
targeted to men because they wouldn't

538
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,770
use them because to

539
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,820
thereof most of them away to a frat
using them

540
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,480
but the a targeting a like the market of

541
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,570
that some men want to see women have sex

542
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,789
with the machine and so there's like
again dislike pretty has extra header

543
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:38,658
sexist

544
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,610
for market like jumping on the whole
thing and not liberating it but just

545
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,919
like selling it to the same guys with
the same

546
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,080
a heteronormative ideas but we want to
talk about that

547
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,070
and the future and Easter future not
only about sex machine spot

548
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,399
modifying your own body so I mean so
many people probably in here have peer

549
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,340
seeing send you know split tongues and
whatever

550
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,880
a would there be future or should there
be a future of probably having like

551
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,230
two penises or to click through whatever
I don't know

552
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,539
%ah there are many many people out there
thinking about body modification

553
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:17,700
and genetical engineering and sacks

554
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,010
because if you like it why not if you
have the money

555
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,500
some people like this like crazy Cirque
du Soleil guy he flew into space for a

556
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,990
couple of million dollars

557
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,289
to the ISS some other crazy millionaire
would say like

558
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:33,870
welcome on I need a second pic now

559
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,330
yeah %ah it's not possible right now but

560
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,928
he's always the future and the problem
is

561
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:49,010
the future is like the jetsons plus rape

562
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,700
and it should not happen I like that
better

563
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,760
without a rape a but you all know for
Chen

564
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,629
I mean I think

565
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,899
the optimum future for fortune would be
that's okay

566
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,960
I but I think we can change that

567
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,120
I think there is a possibility to just
like bill beyond dislike stranger

568
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,899
a like patriarchal thing that we have
for going on

569
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:20,899
right on right here and it's a little
bit of course here because

570
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:25,000
more Packers a male and female a

571
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,779
think about it you if you start
hackerspace try to bring in

572
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:31,950
more female a

573
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,799
people your breed amid really I'm I mean
that because we don't wanna have like

574
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,289
sausage party is a key

575
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:42,970
bring them in because hackerspace isn't
hacker movement is about teaching

576
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,380
it's about learning and you can learn so
much

577
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,490
if you just like do not block a
fifty-percent after it planet's

578
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,179
population

579
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:54,200
okie just learn more %ah

580
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,649
this thing for example would not have
happens

581
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,159
if they wouldn't be a very open a
culture

582
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,880
in the hackerspace Noisebridge in San
Francisco

583
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,899
because one of two female members I mean
yeah how

584
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:11,640
she built steampunk vibrator this one
here is actually

585
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,989
working with Steve you pump steam into
it and it vibrates

586
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:19,159
I mean that stuff and look at that it's
really good

587
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,279
it's a really good piece of machinery a
you usually put something like

588
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,909
on it because the main problem of using
hot steam

589
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:30,720
in a metal thing is like lady speak
therefore

590
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,390
idk authorizes you from within okay I

591
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:39,440
no you so she's mainly using it with
compressed air that works too

592
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,020
but still it's an interesting concept of
using steam to run

593
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,239
a vibrator she won the Prix Ars
Electronica

594
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,270
last year for this machine a another
winner for of the PISA Prix Ars

595
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,620
Electronica was

596
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,049
this thing here i mean you can see a lot
but it's a guy

597
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:58,069
was really interested interested in a

598
00:34:58,069 --> 00:35:02,750
non human sex so he was interested in
plants X

599
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,130
so what he did is he did lots of
research about how plans really react to

600
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,089
lights and sound and stuff

601
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:11,120
so I'm not sure if it really works we
can talk to plants

602
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,890
but he projected certain light patterns
onto plans

603
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,850
and he called plans porn okay so we
thought that's

604
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,609
quite interesting someone is thinking of
plans let's have

605
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:25,920
a plant porn win one of the Prix Ars
Electronica as

606
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,170
a another at work went to

607
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,400
a cheese in Scott with some where the
back here

608
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,690
and cheese and Scott one the work
because a be faulted

609
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,319
highly appropriate because he's
investing so much time

610
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:44,440
collecting smart from the early days of

two cum mature is because kinda julie's

640
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,460
is one of the big researchers about DIY
sex go to its website

641
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,579
it's called sledge Tong slashed on the
dot

642
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:39,950
work and he is researching about but

643
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,020
sex toys who are online and most of them
actually suck

644
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,259
cocaine and so he takes them apart and
does interesting things with them and

645
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,790
make them better

646
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,920
a so go to slash dot dot or it can you

647
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,290
see that he has a couple of really
interesting ideas of like buying

648
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,410
cheap sex technology for a couple of
bucks and making something really

649
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,730
awesome with them

650
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,220
I like how you use awesome other time I
think it just makes the

651
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,170
awesome awesome awesome boss I'm

652
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,990
okay it was common to list the first
winner in 2008 and 2009

653
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,740
this guy I'm collapse dual one the Prix
Ars Electronica lifetime abort

654
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,000
because he is one of the main guys
behind a lecture stimulation

655
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,570
a he came up like he's an electricity

656
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,230
he's interested in a incurrence a

657
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,690
the problem with a like research about
electricity is

658
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,180
there's lots of research about how
electricity kills you

659
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,819
and how it can kill you %ah but there's
less and let rest

660
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,329
almost no research and he did all of it
about

661
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:47,680
how sexuality and electricity

662
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,098
are interacting so how can we put

663
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:55,310
I don't know current through your body
or your penis or chocolate or whatever

664
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,849
for like 12 hours %uh without not
harming you are killing you

665
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:03,650
that's the basic idea there's a huge
let's look at that

666
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:09,010
%ah I mean you see there are lots of
things going on here

667
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,089
and he did all the basic research about
that most of it he tried it on himself

668
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:16,150
so what's happening like six hours of
like this Walt

669
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,130
diseases

670
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,839
is let's turn it on and

671
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:24,099
there's a whole scene about electric
stimulation are

672
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,759
but still a I think you should try it

673
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:30,960
because I try I was kinda afraid of
people think he was there had a couple

674
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,799
of things the year

675
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:35,059
like a portable Tesla coil kinda thing
and you

676
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,130
and you if you rub it on your nipple
it's really cool

677
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,619
zoos it was kinda Fred of like but but
still you're

678
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:44,809
are his name isn't a lab due and

679
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:50,240
the I'm cool Abdul electoral steam just
google it and you'll find his website

680
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,279
he wrote up like the one and only

681
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:56,660
that book about the lecture stimulation
and what you should do and what you

682
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,819
should do it the British

683
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:01,849
shouldn't do like putting like a high
currency 30 hired and stuff

684
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:06,690
a but it's really really interesting and
he came up with the idea of electricity

685
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:07,609
relation because

686
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:10,799
you read about a this experiment

687
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:14,819
from France in the 17th 1700 whatever
your

688
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:18,210
where a guy a asked a couple of people

689
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,329
you know like very butcher arson upper
class and

690
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:25,380
some counts encounter and and counter
suits and stuff and he asked them to

691
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,990
just hold hands and then he was like
pretty occurrence

692
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,420
through them and they all jumped like
frogs

693
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,220
and it was the first time ever electro
stimulation

694
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,019
was used as like a pleasure device or
like find all were not his son it was a

695
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,329
nice and interesting tickling sensation
and blah blah

696
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:46,440
and here at this story and any came okay
I'm an actress and why or why not

697
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,869
let's play with that and up he's done
many many good things in his life

698
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:55,869
so a goods I think

699
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:59,279
most of the stuff I wanted to tell you I
solve it to you

700
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:02,529
already a screwed yourself %ah

701
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:07,339

704
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:17,578

for questions and Q&A in whatever

705
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,630
so if you are interested just like ask

707
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,348
No

708
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:35,220
okay I'm not sure how long I i

709
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,680
thank you okay

710
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,680
just like 43 minutes there's lots of
time to talk

711
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,819
or for you to have sex in the bathroom
okay I okay

712
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm not sure if how hurt she would do
the thing with the microphone I just

713
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,099
repeat the question whatever

714
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:04,099
okay good the what what story

715
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,160
okay I lied okay a

716
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,290
I mean how was the decision made

717
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:18,250
I think it just didn't want to get into
a lawsuit I mean it's a its meet

718
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,319
mainstream film

719
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:22,950
I think they they just like I mean

720
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:28,790
okay you can I maybe

721
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,339
I think there there was some like
serious problem solving going on in one

722
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:35,950
of the meetings in whatever form company
did their

723
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:41,540
I don't know your I mean

724
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,770
the good thing is there is for most of
that stuff there's no real like Real

725
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,390
Clear Lake

726
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,790
legislation for doing that I mean maybe
someone

727
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,970
might come up with the idea like okie if
like

728
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,160
eighty percent of the body of the
actress I

729
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,589
plus the tits that doesn't work so

730
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:04,319
I don't know me there might be some
interesting thing going on in the future

731
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,940
about stuff like that let's

732
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,119
let's see that I can see that
legislation is a little bit slow on the

733
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:10,920
whole process

734
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,930
at the moment okay I can see them so

735
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:19,720
I mean it would be better if someone
down there would the just tell me

736
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,339
who let's take you first K

737
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:29,779
a sex your sex robots

738
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,960
I mean what I could tell you is like

739
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,260
if you want to really sexy robot bill it
yourself so

740
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,550
I think the future will be at it will
date is a market for that and it tasted

741
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,230
like a multi multi multi

742
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,819
a million dollar market for stuff like
that it might not be

743
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:51,609
a it might not be too big right now but

744
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,560
I can remember remind you that there's
so many people doing their own sex

745
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,890
machines there's really

746
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,310
interesting book by Tim a Chia Timothy
archibald from the

747
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,099
be area and he took pictures

748
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,720
of people in rural countryside America
everywhere

749
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,420
endear self-build sex machines so

750
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,170
and you can really like seats like
somewhere in Wisconsin their cows around

751
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,910
in this is like strange

752
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,720
like fucking machine sitting like in
front of this like

753
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,069
suburban like the Rosh and some guy
built as for his wife

754
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:28,220
okie there's so many people out there
who did research and

755
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,170
drove all the way america to meet those
guys so it's not only like that some

756
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:32,770
crazy

757
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,450
companies like ink dot com built
machines will let machines being built

758
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,089
for them to use them in porn

759
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:41,099
there are many people out there who do
it and even some

760
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:45,230
very Catholic once there's one story
other guy who built the sex machine

761
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,930
for his wife and nd gotta got divorced

762
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,069
and anyway to sell the machine and

763
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:55,180
you could only by the machine if you
were married

764
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,730
because it didn't want to set just so
the machine to someone would just like

765
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,369
to use it

766
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:04,300
on a girlfriend no no no sex machine
only if you married okay

767
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,900
a stuff like that I mean there's so many

768
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,260
the the that's what I meant with like we
are to using

769
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,720
a it to using species in a sexual
species because

770
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,710
even though many people think they're
conservative there's a just like a basic

771
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:19,730
sex drive in us

772
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,030
and some stuff just turns us on and you
can even control it I mean

773
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,579
thats fetishes and you know are and
sometimes you know they're

774
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:30,420
crazy interesting stories of like even
like the most crazy like a

775
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,869
teabagging people building sex machines
I mean what

776
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:38,869
yeah okayed

777
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm I was looking into told onyx and I
can't think

778
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,069
look and slashed on about a year ago and
when the first things I noticed about it

779
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:47,599
and

780
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,140
and well as a long distance relationship

781
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,390
back then and but the the problem was

782
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,160
it seemed like the whole communities
kind have it so can a masturbatory

783
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,450
there i'd third I mean I vs like it
seems like

784
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,720
there's more concentration on self
plate-like

785
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,490
its more about jerking yourself off the
computer then jerking someone else after

786
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,260
the computer doesn't seem like there's

787
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,549
I as much to help us like relationships

788
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:17,549
that sort of thing do you think there's
a yeah the bounces off to a to a certain

789
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:19,060
extent I mean I'm just like

790
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,170
including an interesting French Guiana
luck on your

791
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,160
a like ours a French philosopher and he
pretty much

792
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,220
tells us that days all like

793
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,599
we are you there's always the other and
the other is always a projection for

794
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:33,280
self

795
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,150
so even though you think you just like
jerking off with someone else

796
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,339
me at least you're jerking off with
someone else and there is

797
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,339
nope there is no way to tell what's real
sex

798
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:48,349
and what's not real sex I mean it's just
like common cultural

799
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:52,579
idea of what scheck sex should be but
that might change in the future that's

800
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:54,319
what I'm talking about what I'm talking
about

801
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,759
up like changing gender and stuff like
that is like basic idea of like ya there

802
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,690
too

803
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:04,119
like predominantly made female guys in
bed and doing like

804
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:08,819
like five or six different like a can
have sex positions and stuff like that

805
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,470
of course that's valid and it's been
done for a long long long long long long

806
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:12,920
long long long long time

807
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,170
but introduction of Technology into
sexuality

808
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:21,220
a change humanity and it will change
humanity future

809
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,720
so even though at the moment it might be
a little bit boring

810
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,829
me it might change because technology
might become better

811
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:32,130
or be ye maybe that's the way he may be
that a new

812
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:36,069
area of sexual sexual like interactions

813
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:43,069
that might not be compared with what we
had before I don't know

814
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:50,059
then please tell me when I should shut
up I don't know ok

815
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:53,640
so ever question om about serve
hybridization

816
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,950
have humans and machines new I'm so
there's work

817
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,059
the in a few from Lee was still lurk of
course yeah

818
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:03,099
crazy Australian yeah yeah I'm gray kayo
is

819
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:07,089
with your thoughts on that in actually
incorporating the technology

820
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:11,130
into our bodies as opposed to Julia
outside machines that was pretty much

821
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,119
like the topic

822
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:15,799
are last year's Ars Electronica like us
intercourse and intercourse

823
00:48:15,799 --> 00:48:19,920
I mean if you're not familiar to stay
like he's a crazy artist technologist

824
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,749
and he's he's he's done stuff like
actually swallowing

825
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:27,289
pieces a fight that would then be in his
stomach as part of him

826
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:30,349
so he's like putting out into himself
and stuff like that

827
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:33,450
are of course I mean he has like general

828
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:38,059
vision ARF have whatever like he thinks
that humans

829
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:41,989
should not think of like just going to
space they should live in space

830
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:45,279
and you should not live in like a gnat
tin can like the ISS

831
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:49,509
they should be in space like their body
should be modified

832
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:54,349
to be able to tolerate like I don't know
like to can help in overtime

833
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:58,890
your so a he's pretty crazy about the
whole stuff but I have to remind you

834
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,480
that the whole cyborg movement

835
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,039
started in the early 1960s because

836
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:07,400
this crazy guy kinda said hey up

837
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,450
we need new concepts for a spacesuits

838
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,910
and he came up with the general idea of
the cyborg suit idea of the cyborg was

839
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,460
created because someone is thinking
about space suits

840
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,069
a ants I mean if you can think of it is
porn of it

841
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:26,730
I'm not sure if there is space suit porn
but I can tell you

842
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,289
a couple of years ago actually ten years
ago

843
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:33,910
it was the first its declaration in zero
gravity

844
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:38,470
it was shot for a porn film in one of
these like diving airplanes

845
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,630
40 film called to act that you did

846
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,940
Uranus experiment I mean

847
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,249
a poor production company invested money

848
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:52,220
in hiring like one of this like
parabolic airplanes

849
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,390
to shoot the cum shots okay our

850
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,660
check it out it's probably a part B
Uranus

851
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,788
experiments okay yup

852
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:05,220
so the hybridization I think it will
happen I don't know

853
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,839
how it will happen but I mean for the
star two penises okay

854
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,239
I guess your see talk about a

855
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,059
sex being a driver for a lot of
technological innovation arm

856
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:20,119
are you concerned that this only drive
certain parts of technological

857
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:20,890
innovation

858
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,640
and that's arm ultimately will become
self serving and basically

859
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,890
be the end of human civilization yeah

860
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,839
I think the main problem is that the
main problem of human civilization at

861
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:34,799
the moment is

862
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:39,599
a I mean we're all longing for like an
apocalypse just like every time it's

863
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:40,650
always baird's

864
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,769
like all the bad apocalypse movies
pop-up

865
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:47,319
like Logans run since the from its not
bad but

866
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:51,369
there's certain areas when popular
culture actually reflects what people

867
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:52,650
think about their society

868
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:57,019
in the seventies lot of like dooms the
film's and now the doomsday films like

869
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:57,930
reemerge

870
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:02,480
because you know it's such a bedtime and
stuff the problem he is

871
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,059
that the real apocalypse is that they
pucker lips will never happen

872
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,190
that's a problem your stock in this like
ongoing it might

873
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:13,489
get better know it's just like going
worse it might get better know it's just

874
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:14,400
going where's

875
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,400
that's the problem of of human
civilization at the moment your

876
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,660
so I think that I if we talk

877
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,319
like from a moralistic point of view
about sex and technology

878
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,180
weekend it's like in it its

879
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:35,150
spew speculation of course I mean you
can think it's probably a bad thing that

880
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:35,930
could be per

881
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:40,359
gutenberg printed erotica on his
printing press but I'm not sure if that

882
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:43,930
was a good or bad decision we cannot
like just like make a decision okay well

883
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,019
he should not have done that they should
not if marketed

884
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:50,989
the swinger they should not have like
invested in broadband internet

885
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:55,960
because it was just for a like bankers
at Homewood don't want to go to a DVD or

886
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,170
VHS store

887
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,730
to get the point I don't know I think

888
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:05,440
it's hard to judge all of that stuff
it's way more interesting I think

889
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,529
to look details look into details

890
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:12,700
to take one certain aspect like Blu ray
wise Blu ray dare

891
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,519
and not HD kinda thing you're other one
was actually

892
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:20,289
that the opposite thing a Blu ray but
this lunatic artsy

893
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:25,150
HD DVD that was it okay and Blu ray just
made it because the japanese porn market

894
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,519
was highly interested in Blu ray DVD

895
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,749
okay so mmm again we have this like

896
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:34,009
VHS kinda thing but at

897
00:52:34,009 --> 00:52:37,880
I highly urge you to goal online

898
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,690
and check the back story of Blu ray and
why they decided to do with them blah

899
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,579
blah blah

900
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:46,319
that's in interesting a way to deal with
the problem

901
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,329
the problem is not we cannot talk about
will

902
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:54,700
the human species go down the drains

903
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,779
now I'm not talking really more proper
okay I'm talking about like

904
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:02,859
like space exploration you mention space
exploration I mean

905
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:06,430
if if there's sex machines everywhere
and everyone can wake whenever they want

906
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,509
then there's no reason to do anything or
two so

907
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:14,079
like leave the planet before you dont
yeah I mean I I like to when can have

908
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,369
sex I'm still doing things

909
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:20,660
a good one recommendation one
recommendation about that

910
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,848
there's an excellent Scottish writer
called Iain Banks

911
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:26,969
you for tip in banks yen banks are
sometimes

912
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:30,749
%um banks and he wrote his first science

much like a socialist

917

anarchist utopia and you think hey

918

boring a

923
00:54:06,769 --> 00:54:11,920
read all the culture novels at the
culture cycle but %um banks

924
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,910
about this interesting utopia that still
has problems

925
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,910
but it could give you a sense of what
I'm talking about how we might be able

926
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,670
to change

927
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,719
society in the future and

928
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:26,789
I'm not have courted science fiction of
course it's to a certain extent not

929
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:27,730
plausible

930
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,969
but it gives you a good an interesting
point of view %ah

931
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:34,259
about what could happen and maybe we
should do that

935
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,819

force we have so

936
