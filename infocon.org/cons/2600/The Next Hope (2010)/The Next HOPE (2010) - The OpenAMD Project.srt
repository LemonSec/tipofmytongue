1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,470
howdy as a way this works

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,819
this work is ongoing to briefly show you
some cool things you can do with your

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:07,419
batch

4
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,590
a few which nearly got me sued and I'm

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,029
we can move on from there up bloody hell
is it's the last

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:19,939
now the screws don't work

7
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:26,230
is it coming back up or down

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,890
I can see it

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,890
the yeah

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,820
now I is it up

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,030
right okay so I hate modern electronics

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,850
and and then my resolutions up to 640 by
480

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,010
the way that the projector works is it
is actually from inside the contains the

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,199
preferred resolution

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,469
and you can change that sig actually
booby-trapped a

16
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,600
projector to only do 640 by 480 ugly as
it is now

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,600
cool outweigh exchanging I hate
technology

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,330
icy blue now confirm

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,020
great a okay

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,770
now you can see it the left side is cut
off

21
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,830
okay fixes you can suffer

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,649
I so this is my help patch and install
the badge hacking shit

23
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:35,750
so on the back and got a USB port failed

24
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,110
plug my badge into the computer

25
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,849
we can do this nifty little trick I

26
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:48,200
good fat died NRF sniffle be that's the
badge traffic

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,759
and anyone who likes can actually see if
this and do the same

28
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,179
if I freeze this and I scroll up a bit

29
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,619
do you see these these records with the
ffff

30
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,179
or I can capture them individually on

31
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:07,860
it said

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,470
these packets are coming from one of you
who has

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,480
reflash the badge 3j tag and not
bothered to include a serial number

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,599
and analyst the

35
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,030
feel sorry standout we disabled
photography for this

36
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,030
cell if you'd like to mess with vast
network were

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,060
buildings that response to the badges
you can feel free to do that

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,370
on I will be committee source code to
the repository which is on SourceForge

39
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,200
the president is an each batch

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,950
you can check out my subversion all the
manufacturing files already there

41
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,030
including the traction files were sent
to the manufacture

42
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,800
on if he said like you can also

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,560
reprogram your badge to receive traffic
in a stand-alone mode

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,250
I if I can get it might appear

45
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,430
this is our resident robot and her
lights are blinking in response to

46
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,650
batch traffic because there's actually
an extra badge prototype

47
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,740
on the rear that's wired to the LED's

48
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,610
you can do any the stuff you like will
be doing a badge hacking workshop

49
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,140
tomorrow and Sunday have so I have some
fun

50
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,470

51
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:30,470

55
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,160

presupposes a lot of people here

56
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,220
this is a really really good vibes you
guys rock

57
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,510
on so this is a panel love

58
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,670
a lot of people who have been for leaks
have it all in the batch projects so

59
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,630
I'm ascetics this is Travis and we'll
discuss reintroduce ourselves and it's a

60
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,220
little bit

61
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,520
I'm kind of turn into the pointy haired
boss the whole thing so I'm going to

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,840
you know takes the blame when everything
goes bad and try to push everyone to do

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,069
a great job and that's really not that
hard with this team

64
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,859
think we have one of the best teams ever
worked with so patsy

65
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,168
monster from outside Chur and high and
Davis I was working

66
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:25,370
direct you travel so license I have
usually been fracked contractual people

67
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,610
and I E for the SAG conference agrees is
an alternate reality game

68
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,129
which happens on the confidence as well
and the first cue for us isn't much

69
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,590
so I'm here basically if if people there

70
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,590
know about us or if you have have
problems with next and Mitch and I

71
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,039
oversaw the manufacturing and the badge
in kind heard it a few

72
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:55,080
a bar little keys to get things in on
time and you can still we got things

73
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,639
the few minutes before the conference
started I'm

74
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,660
Travis Goodspeed the batch layout design

75
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,480
reported the firmware from the open
beacon project and all supported the

76
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,130
good for projects to run on the bench
hey I'm Rob

77
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,060
I did most data mining fitzco occurring
behind the back

78
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,590
and Hermosa integration are I should
also take a moment to say that

79
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,540
this project would not have happened
twin offered a significant efforts

80
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,639
up dozens of people who are not sitting
here this is definitely a major major

81
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,370
collaboration

82
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,360
yeah I'm and pharma Khan and I was busy
running around finding those people

83
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,410
worth the extra collaboration and i'm
looking in

84
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,690
and discerning like hey guys it's really
fun right you wanna sit and fix the

skins

86
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,660
unit I on Echo

87
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,710
I'm for your training games try and make
this con-

88
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,060
a little more friendly between all those

89
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,900
Cumberland

90

letter bittermann but how many people

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,669

93
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,280
call and how many of you have heard of
sputnik

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,310

95
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,729
international effort

96
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,240
are the other person whose sheer her
crew could not be here but he's

97
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,830
definitely here in spirit

98
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,389
is milosz are Mary actual created a peak
in which is the company that

99
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,300
did all the RFID readers and we're very
very grateful to have

100
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,970
are now a lot of people they can't make
up for various reasons

101
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,930
gonna militia in particular he and his
wife brother just celebrated the birth

so which is sure to run the
phosphorylation graduation

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,009
life

105
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:53,280
without milosz none of this would have
happened are militias been involved in a

106
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,400
number projects with the CCC

107
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,449

Anna Germany for the CCC conferences and
they've been very inspirational and

111
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,360
helping us put together we have mapped

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
so there's definitely a lot of history
behind this and we keep on a new people

113
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
and

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,350
the more conferences we have with this
the more amazing new people see

115

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,849
we have no 26 you have profiles

159
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,070
without art you can at france

160
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,510
are

161
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,319
so im

162
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,330
in the trend also we have an open API
which some people have done

163
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:25,030
an incredible job waif and using and

164
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,860
so she wanna get to odd more serious
note

165
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,770
yeah we know where you are yeah

166
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,970
watching you arm but

167
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,070
we're very transparent about what's
going on

168
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,670
are you choose everything you share

169
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,329
and you may revoke anything that you
have shared with us

170
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,600
but we are watching and we are analyzing
everything you do

171
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,650
so I guess if I should say one thing

172
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,069
%ah keep your eyes open and you'll be in
for a surprise

173
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:06,070
%ah

174
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm not sure what to add at this point
but

175
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,100
down yeah one of the things we talked
about

176
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,880
at the last hope ways to create a

177
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,860
batch tracking system that would not
only be really fun but to you

178
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,980
have a fun way an interesting way to get
people to think about the information

179
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,790
that is freely shared

180
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,819
by all of us on the social network
systems and loyalty cards et cetera et

181
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,400
cetera

182
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,900
we use credit cards we have phones we
have all these ways of having oliver

183
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,840
information

184
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,660
put out into hands that don't really
care about us but just to make profit

185
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,380
we didn't really explore that too much
for the last hope but we wanted to

186
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,390
explore that

187
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,510
in interesting ways that we hopefully
creep people out

188
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,480
a little bit but within the comfort zone
that

189
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,240
wouldn't creep people out a lot so um
that may or may not happen

190
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,380
for this country arm

191
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,890
mining job thomas wylde besides for just
some

192
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,360
interjecting stuff like that is to get
the badges manufactured

193
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,060
up with high quality and on-time we got
in on time

194
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,980
thank you

195
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,740
Angeles most of them work really well
hours so

196
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,160
I guess I'll just put out now %uh if you
have a badge or see anyone with a badge

197
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,600
that the red light forget the other
colored lights for now

198
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,020
but the red light %uh is either not
blinking

199
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,590
arm it's just read on board a string of

200
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,450
than your badge is in a weird state arm

201
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,890
and you have to take the battery out put
it in out in out in out to smooth out

202
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,430
some the rough edges

203
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,860
on a contact in any fit and then it
should work

204
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,110
should lot

205
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,350
said look using

206
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,860
flathead screwdriver this scrape off the

207
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,790
Miller yeah so anyways

208
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,620
if we get the word out that you have to
do this than now hopefully everyone who

209
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,420
once worked in batch will have one

210
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,840
yeah I just wanna to

211
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,660
go again bouncing up for which was
saying about the privacy element

212
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,540
what we've done is we've created a
technology and technology can be used

213
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,349
for

214
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,750
many purposes and some other scary and
some other more fun

215
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,710
so scary would be awake Anna anybody
here is Facebook

216
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,740
really that's it

217
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,310
nobody else's Facebook Stonewood rare

218
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,910
and how many times is Facebook's privacy
policy changed in the last few months

219
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,150
exactly for

220
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,270
right it's a prime number something like
that so

221
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:12,020
we're exploring what happens when you
take technology and make it opens so

222
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,050
one of the criticisms people made as
well you're doing all this it's scary

223
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,930
would have some government corporation
season wants to take advantage

224
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,940
well our answers that we've made it open
to people so that they can explore it

225
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,040
and they can learn from it and they can
create their own not on their ideas

226
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,089
their own innovations

227
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,390
but also understand how it works so that
when they see somebody that's misuse and

228
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,130
technology

229
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,390
they can try to teach them to have the
technology used in a better way

230
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,750
cuz the whole purpose in this is to try
to draw people together

231
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,570
when we did this experiment at the last
20 the entire point was

232
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,650
well you coming to a conference right
and it means you probably want to get

233
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,050
all your basement and go

234
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,800
make new friends are see old friends and
we're trying to create a tool that will

235
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,580
make that easier

236
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,380
and a lot more fun so that's where a lot
of the social networking element comes

237
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,050
into play

238
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,830
we can see a lot of docs dancing around
the screen sometimes click on them and I

239
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,340
get more information

240
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,670
by it at an all the social networking
elements that are going to be on the web

241
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,630
site that you guys can access

242
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,360
that's going to make this way way way
more interesting so

243
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,150
you can either view this as planned with
simple technology you can view this is a

244
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,650
futuristic society

245
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,949
you can view this is anything you want
and if you have anything to add to it

246
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,090
please let us know that's where the
steer

247
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,800
API as being book open in public

248
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,680
on stinger Vati keep an eye on a handed
out hope that net

249
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,770
is gonna be a bit of for the weekend we
have example code coming in from various

250
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,520
people

251
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,090
a book that was written before and a lot
it's actually being written literally

252
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,710
while we're at the start so if you wanna
mess around 20 some samples their sums

253
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,860
up the Python this example Ruby

254
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,820
if you wanna race exams another language
you'll feel free to to find a bus

255
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,370
and say hey I wanna chip in and will act
as a repository and then you can

256
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,820
you know at some more access to this and
make it easier for people to know

257
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,930
different languages

258
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,030
to dig into the data things on the papi

259
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:02,839
and just see medical stuff is very yet
tangentially there are two other people

260
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,970
who have contributed this who I

261
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,250
think is and refresher by chance

262
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,110
okay I don't see handsome answer so
there to people that also contributed a

263
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,420
lot

264
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,520
shoes may or may not be here one of them
is Michael Ian the others and refresh

265
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,829
Fe have done a lot of work in the mobile
development side which we've been trying

266
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,010
to integrate

267
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,200
on how many have you have a %uh
smartphones

268
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,500
androids and iPhones and stuff like that
on if you guys so anything is in putting

269
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,010
out over the last week or so

270
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,900
you can actually download an application
for your phone and user to interact with

271
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,910
the conference

272
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,510
and the best part of all this was we're
least the Android app for it

273
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,680
so as but

274
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,880
it works great well as first awesome

275
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,470
I should yes

276
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,930
and just to show an element hola
beautiful the community spirit is

277
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,410
I was just a couple days ago trying to
show off the Android app says

278
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,260
I thought was really close on a show to
a friend of mine so I walked like in the

279
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,390
marketplace

280
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,000
an I was looking for the the next hope
after a and

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,180
I found another one somebody actually
released unofficial third party app for

282
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,620
us

283
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,400
and they called the unofficial hope at
and they didn't bother to tell anyone

284
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,690
had to find a bygone the marketplace

285
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,990
/url it does a lot of the same stuff but
it has a really pretty layout is a

286
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,870
little bit different

287
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,829
so now is called yet another hope thanks

288
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:33,090
I by yes so there are many many ways you
can contribute in work on this project

289
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,580
even at the conference Kors wanna favors
one of my favorite pastimes Akana is

290
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,020
meeting somebody new and then spend the
rest of the time working on some crazy

291
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,940
project with them

292
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,880
an may be right for forty hours straight
you have a lot over regular club matter

293
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,059
but it's well worth it that's why I
kinda hope lotta fun

294
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,520
so so

295
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,639
one thing we haven't really cover go to
some the technical side zipper

296
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,600
besides the best we have saw for sites
to first you want

297
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,309
like the database analyst

298
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,720
self

299
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,750
of fundamentally it's

300
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,790
it's just a 3 it's just that three-part

301
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,860
our system there's an aggregator that is
collecting data from the readers

302
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,730
which then goes into a central not know
seacoast

303
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,480
storage and then we have a web front-end
are

304
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,090
the polls from it this is

305
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,750
large largely a any

306
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,650
any behaviors you do on the website many
of them

307
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,140
all of them are are tracked

308
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,919
analyzed recorded and also placed into

309
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,809
no single repository I

310
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,010
oh I did want to mention one more thing
which was

311
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,160
you actually can often whether you want
your data in the public API feed

312
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,450
and you can also opt in or opt out of
what do you want your due to be

313
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:04,890
published

314
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,950
at least after the conference this again
in the team

315
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,580
love huge you decide what happens to
your data

316
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,909
it is your data not arcs sparkle any

317
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,679
corporate website actually inching
enough if you to a Dartmouth Addu

318
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,280
there's a

319
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,059
that there's a projector called crowd at
which is meta data from

320
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:29,010
you know geospatial data and the last
job actually scrubbed a bunch of data

321
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,320
and release to simplify data set to
crowd at

322
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,580
so you can also you can go back and go
back two years

323
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,699
and then you look through all that
information as well arm

324
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,990
it's you partisan basically giving back
to the community and making this

325
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,270
available as a research

326
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,440
you know sir %uh surface ur

327
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,960
substance 9 I'll just put out there is
that now that the website is working we

328
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,260
encourage you to give up as much of your
personal information on that website is

329
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,710
part

330
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,070
absolutely the more you give up the more
fun it's going to be for everyone

331
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,918
specialists to forget them

332
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,160
they could see the data to so it's gonna
be a lot of stuff going on on the fresh

333
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,340
forget there's just a couple a group of
people that I wanted a sec

334
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,570
I let's see how many different person we
have so we have the people who are

335
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,928
working on the

336
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,190
badges which is basically you guys is
there anybody up

337
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:24,770
wanna thank in addition to yourselves
for the Badgers No will suffice

338
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:30,550
fair enough yeah I know we use the same
manufacture values for TV B Gone

339
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,600
and he did a lot of work are for free
basically he didn't make any money on

340
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,540
these badges:

341
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,139
actually I think there is one person
should say thank you to not Texas

342
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,669
Instruments

343
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:43,660
oh yes ok as a valid reason

344
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,630
so as this is beginning I really wanted
to add USB support to the bad is such

345
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,830
that they could pack and stuff

346
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,059
all that fun stuff but the Texas
Instruments chips that I wanted for that

347
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,220
were rather expensive

348
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,400
they donated twenty five thousand
dollars worth of chips which

349
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:04,400
is actually more than the entire
production run cost Sahand on say at the

350
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,139
chips are

351
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,130
advance join Utah Vermont home for you
can execute the chips after the

352
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:14,590
conference

353
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,500
yet said the badge itself has

354
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,250
212 kilobytes flash memory the firmware
is built in C

355
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,549
its this YouTube that's pretty tough I'm
just

356
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,460
stand-up back the the stock yes

357
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,220
okay said the firmware is written in C
is compiled with the

358
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,990
for completely C compiler to build and
install it you take make install

359
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,340
which i think is very innovative feature
I'll you don't have to install and I D E

360
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,639
load up the girl you know that garbage

361
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,500
pre-built versions GCC which can spot
downsize shops directory

362
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,669
are available on my server and links
from the really files

363
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:01,130
arm once you're writing a code on it you
just have access to the radio

364
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,210
through an SPI serial port and then

365
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,250
any a software

366
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,659
advised you want it I N you just have to
write code for

367
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:14,140
on this is a turning point to currencies
for

368
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,950
a classroom an audience response systems
so if we're using this here

369
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,050
everyone if you would have a clicker and
I would ask you to say vote press one if

370
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,270
you want me to shut up into if you'd
like to go and what

371
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,980
technical detail Island as you press it
would be broadcast

372
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,409
stage you can packets if these using the
next batch

373
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:35,490
and you can build devices such as to
Brazil robot which

374
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,600
respond to radio signals from other
batters I'm so if you wind up with two

375
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,659
that is one in which has been hacked

376
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,020
you can then have to make your coffee
maker start as you walk into your living

377
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,940
room

378
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,169
were all sorts of fun stuff like that at
home after the conference has ended

379
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,450
all if free and open toolkit and

380
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,250
the full source code for the project is
online

381
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,250
yet said is very confusing he is

382
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,940
something about act which means

383
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,830
Senate you notice that the red light is
blinking might be a bit difficult to see

384
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,730
smacked a few touch the crystal with one
finger

385
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,830
and with the other finger and thumb you
touch the middle the bad and the Green

386
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,439
Knight

387
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
will come on and if you do the right is
a badge

388
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,450
than the blue light come on and at the
far left the red light will remain on

389
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,809
and dispatch presses are also broadcast

390
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,020
along with fewer 0 number to the servers
and they could be carried through the

391
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,418
network

392
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,669
it is part in the dataset not got F as
if you want to

393
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:43,040
I am as a touch your badge at the
Institute something interesting happens

394
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,020
you can later look back to the dataset

395
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,960
and see when the button switches over

396
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,860
as another nicely featured the
manufacturing tolerances and these chips

397
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,929
are stored in their own flash memory

398
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,370
and these are broadcast with every
single packet so by taking the packet

399
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,149
log after this conference has ended

400
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:04,370
I will know the exact manufacturing
tolerances 1800 and ask you for 30

401
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,490
microcontrollers

402
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:10,330
out of two batches a in doing a second
then figure out how far the very

403
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,689
and all sorts of other fun and useful
stuff

404
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:19,580
def and I i think that this is actually
by far the best

405
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,689
development kit for the amnesty for 30
because everything's

406
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,790
in place and there's an open till Jan
everything so have some fun with that

407
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:32,330
and use the amnesty for 30 in your own
product designs

408
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,530
yes

409
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,389
yes I'm me pull up the design if you
don't mind

410
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,929
to make this a lot easier to go I'm
sympathy

411
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,520
happening right now is is my screen
showing

412
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,290
okay cough answer this actually is the
Subversion repository that you can grab

413
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,928
from the server yourself

414
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,330
ions I go into the harbor directory

415
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,740
there are a couple of older ones that
works

416
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,370
they're only manufactures for attacks
but as the NHP 12

417
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,409
or 12 P that is the batch you have

418
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:11,990
and we can open the schematic did is an
evil cat file

419
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:18,990
you don't need any special licenses or
anything freeware version will suffice

420
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,490
Eagle cross-checking when I wanna show
so

421
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,000
this is the batch

422
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,690
resume in a bit I here you have DJ Tek
connector

423
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,159
and this is what the badges are
programmed by during production

424
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,270
have programmers placed into it and
Windows batch script

425
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,620
couples a pie to EXE execute a ble which
reflash is the badges new software

426
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,909
and then also with a test case so I can

427
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:50,240
and verify on every single batch that
the radio is receiving traffic

428
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,899
and that ensures that I have no analog
problems

429
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:58,140
as far as how the radios wired

430
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,230
living over here we have the ice pads
this is a breakout

431
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,240
have the SPI port which connects to the

432
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,050
radio if you tap this you can actually
watch the traffic going back and forth

433
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,918
between microcontrollers radio

434
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,810
and I and other boards you might want to
tap this to figure out which

435
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,570
channel or packet lacked mac address is
being used

436
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,530
and will be doing that to enhance
microcontroller

437
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,290
a demo board in the sunday workshop to
determine

438
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,060
d low levels of the ass networking
protocol which is used by sports watches

439
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,250
and

440
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,950
heart rate monitors and things like that
I

441
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,159
if anyone hears from company that might
be offended by this

442
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,470
please by me there %ah

443
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,980
appear we have and the right we have the
BSL connector

444
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,340
on I don't know whether or not this will
work because I've never tried it but

445
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,060
this should work with an FTDI cable he
senses special

446
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,600
have flags to the bootloader and that
might be a lot easier than soldering

447
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,790
the badge hacking kept

448
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,990
as a zoom out and that everything in red
here's an answer

449
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,139
the top side to the board and everything
in blue is on the bottom

450
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:10,490
you might wanna look at your own badges
I'm going through this on

451
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,010
the this year out at the left and then
the

452
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,230
two roads chip that's on the bottom
which are not populated on your badges

453
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,120
are four USB port that's how I run the
packet sniffing code

454
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,090
and it also makes truck suffer
development a lot easier because you can

455
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,899
reflash the board without a Jaytech
programmer

456
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:32,379
on the soldering this is difficult but
there are kits available

457
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:38,149
and if you are patient and you do not
user soldering iron is a chisel

458
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:42,860
I'll you can get it working

459
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,330
yeah it does not it's not for beginners

460
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,399
it is a lot of fun though and there's a
good sense of accomplishment

461
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,990
if and when you get it working %ah out
here the right

462
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,919
there is a surface mount as as as
service tray Santana

463
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,540
this is not perfectly tuned but it's
close enough the

464
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,310
packets get in and out I and then down
at the bottom

465
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,840
these a GPIO pads can be reprogrammed to
do anything you like

466
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,929
and said you're trying to build an
add-on module to your board C-one add a

467
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,730
second radio to it we want to make it
into a TV B Gone

468
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,830
were anything else you can imagine

469
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,139
you could aspire this out to any other
board and then write C++ code that runs

470
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:24,730
inside the microcontroller

471
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,500
and talks to where you can catch the
firmware to behave slightly different

472
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:29,879
way

473
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:34,440
to use those airports when it built the
reservoir I just took the seven and

474
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,120
eight cans

475
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,120
out here in the right and I wear them up
to the LED eyes

476
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,270
and then I'm ran the other side the
LED's to ground

477
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,480
but a series resistor in between and
Iran

478
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,730
a self-test routine that receives radio
traffic and then

479
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,040
instead of thinking just the internal
LED's I had also

480
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,658
like the ice at this is parked free on
the amnesty for 30

481
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,679
you can find that nurse clinics

482
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,970
any other questions

483
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,950
in my talk tomorrow and building in
breaking help actually going into

484
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,220
absurd technical detail on how this
works and however verse engineered

485
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,620
similar device

486
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:22,620
thank you

487
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:31,100
this isn't anything new lights and the
message about this before the conference

488
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,090
started but

489
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,830
if you have done something interesting
with the PI we do want to know about it

490
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,080
and do email AMD ad hoc tot net are with
the link to what you've done

491
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,070
and we're going to gather up art %um the
conference

492
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,689
and %uh put up a little gallery of all
the court in people's on

493
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,220
cell we really do wanna see

494
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,510
how you use this data

495
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,460
and I think we may be having a some kind
of opportunity through the conference we

496
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,240
can show off

497
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,139
if you have a visual you've created your
brother conference should show it off

498
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:06,500
plate get as many people see and enjoy
it as possible iced that's the entire

499
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,470
point to create in

500
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,490
so om

501
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,820
but see somebody else I had mentioned
emulation grid a Marriott before I just

502
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,840
wanted to mention the company name is
open beacon dont work

503
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,740
and they have been monumentally helpful
and getting all this working basically

504
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,149
without them into

505
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:26,370
Travis and everyone else we would not
have any hardware

506
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,429
at all they have done really really
generous and working with us

507
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,470
once again open beak and on work

508
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,480
past that we've got a lot of people that
are working on some crazy stuff and

509
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,310
software side

510
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,190
so was its best and Cassandra and Django

511
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,570
is dissidents what exactly is Cassandra
how does it differ from say

512
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,740
sequel are it's basically just in

513
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,320
it's basically just another version
rather

514
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,480
it's another way of doing on mem cash so
it's a nice distributed

515
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,950
key-value store we out we use it because

516
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,040
week get thousands OVA messages a second

517
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:11,408
and we want to store all after

518
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:15,879
right I think a lot over it's very good
for redundancy is very good for systems

519
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:19,429
that need to be acting very quickly I
think Twitter's use and stuff like that

520
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,429
could be wrong and did you can read it
in

521
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:26,790
all those other web companies

522
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:31,408
so which is there some the advantages to
using to senator

523
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:35,370
I'm not trying to promote Cassandra okay
I didn't mean to promote

524
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:41,230
I just I am really excited with how the
stuff has been tryna

525
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,190
you cool on does anybody in the audience
for questions for us all

526
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,190
aka Arthur

527
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,960
tribute Washington the question was

528
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,840
what do the LED's do as far as the
colors and the meaning

529
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,560
I'm the red LED blinks to indicate that
a packet is being broadcast

530
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,260
actually a group of four packets each
for being cents

531
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,740
in a row the

532
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,360
green and blue LED's fiery indicative

533
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
does detect sensor so if you touch the
crystal with one hand and then

534
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,150
put your finger above and below the
board along that that it can

535
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:34,310
GPIO for sure at the bottom it would
like the others and losses and

536
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,990
that information out to the server
occasional every batch gets dirty these

537
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,610
compds Dec

538
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,080
circus but that's a tough one

539
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,560
yes just for fun

540
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,940
arm you mention the API can you give a
quick overview have had access ed

541
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,950
when you can do with it orders that
ickes

542
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,970
note by K

543
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,720
so its

544
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,300
are so

545
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,480
you can access the PI up by going to

546
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,930
each UPS site API dot hope dotnet

547
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,220
out this will bring you to the
documentation for the PI

548
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,320
and everything will

549
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,500
be there %ah not all the features

550
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,530
actually exist you can only particularly
poll

551
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,770
just one section that you want to update
guide there's no

552
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,360
cross matching as I might indicate
documentation

553
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,070
but it does follow documentation unit
are so

554
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,110
which made callers maples locations
maypole I

555
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,000
informations on the user's email
confirmations on the talks

556
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,140
an email confirmation on the speakers
and of course you can combine this

557
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,020
information

558
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,270
to find out are which users like which
speakers

559
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:00,450
and arm which of

560
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,890
which locations to speakers like

561
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,360
you can also

562
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,730
the other buddies auspey store so if you
wanna go anyone

563
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,429
play a game like if you wanna reason
code where you can pressure buns

564
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,840
and you people in a region capture the
flag you know if your area Reitz that

565
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,179
number two but at same time to change
course things like that those games are

566
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,300
totally fell below rate

567
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,679
and that's actually what a lot of us are
you working over the weekend is kinda

568
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,950
doing things live on the spot what do we
have to train it becomes

569
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:35,870
games traction things like that as
comfortable are you doing anything with

570
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,350
their last hope badges

571
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:43,069
%ah

572
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:49,120
listen to the street much the street
you'll see interesting thanks

573
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,359
for my dad I you can also harvest the
components may last a badge to build the

574
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,070
next up on

575
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,820
as you can get a blank badge alone give
you the parts but this is only if you're

576
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,880
a god it's honoring

577
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,380
yet cresting a bad back patch

578
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,150
valued pieces okay I should why should
also add

579
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,460
if you are interested in our

580
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,750
linking your last fall back sir current
batch

581
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,480
so that we could integrate some back
last hope information

582
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,280
are 5 find me and a

583
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,800
I'll do that for you question

584
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,340
I'm have a movement inside have the room

585
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,730
verses movement from room the room

586
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,020
what generates a year record in your
sick dairies

587
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,700
is strictly based

588
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,490
on whether reader to tax you %ah

589
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,570
sup different rooms are pop pop Lee

590
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,900
with our readers with different density
are mostly talk

591
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,310
rooms aren't nearly as I well populated
as %uh

592
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,529
the mezzanine party because you guys are
sitting down

593
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,880
you're not you know every removing I and

594
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,830
it's much easier to extract which talks
attended wonders

595
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,020
less noise in there are

596
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,359
at the same time remember to readers to
have a range of 60 feet

597
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:22,529
so there's a certain particular range
for what the pic

598
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,420
op accuracy varies in the I would say
about the 10-15 feet

599
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,859
%ah area so take

600
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:34,509
take two readings with that particular
error tolerance

601
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,580
alright Mich this is for you just

602
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:42,609
pictures on here on the problem that
you've mentioned about the year

603
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:46,299
battery and it now RK at

604
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,359
this my third batch they said it would
give me another one if greatest

605
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,859
RK on I do not denies it

606
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:57,720
resin coated build-up on the contact
however

607
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,300
I believe another problem accessed my
sugar preface this by saying with

608
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:01,740
something

609
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,030
doesn't work it interests me more than
when it does

610
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,250
RK why and I think

611
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,580
my piano problem you're the guy so

612
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,910
discussion and this guy or what in the
front had his hand up in

613
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,080
microphones here so I mean I feel bad
talkin so

614
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,310
power everyone can line up but

615
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,820
yet it its it's actually a manufacturing
problem the

616
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:32,820
cooled down that path to quicklys has a
rough surface

617
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:02,810
its

618
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,730
yes just picking up a resistance band
and sweat has

619
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:11,550
salts in itself on yeah he's just saying
that to some lights might light up

620
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,710
because I've sweat

621
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,390
its such including their sweaty closings
he's fucking fluctuations

622
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,839
can be picked up of course and perhaps
you can extract which have

623
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,810
you are nervous

624
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,410
I'll just point out that is now under
total record a una

625
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,569
fat I'm all have you been hanging out
noon hackers

626
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,050
okay

627
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,130
did you ask your question first or so
ago are

628
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,040
another you guys want people to write
applications using API and such

629
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,180
on but I know that you've got to mention
several times today

630
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,060
blips on the map and I know that looking
at the open beak and then sputnik

631
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,940
website for

632
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,710
a couple years now i've seen that they
have maps for people walk around the

633
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,200
room when you contract them

634
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,920
do you guys have a website that has a
map

635
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,420
love the rooms with blips walking around
because if you do have found your

636
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:12,420
if

637
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:21,599
even will be getting put up in about an
hour

638
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,190
okay and worse and worse we look for
that out

639
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,890
on the AMD dot or the bad start yeah
look for that on India

640
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:33,150
national doubling at least are asking
employees learnable plasma screen opens

641
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,530
her up

642
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,609
the rooms to have the same visualization
on it gon

643
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:39,990
for some early adolescence everything
click on a bad or something and see the

644
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,710
number in

645
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,770
we could find some particular person for
you okay good

646
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:47,940
i want for dinner they're awesome me
being a flying feature if it works right

647
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:54,940
so

648
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,109
this next question

649
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:12,780
re: he commented that the password
verification didn't seem to be working

650
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:19,780
to on the website so another comment
about the user interface of the website

651
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,620
next

652
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,130
experts book okay arm for to book can
you just

653
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,520
you mention that there are bad acting
workshops can you just say

654
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,920
when exactly what should one brain does
one need to bring on soldering iron urn

655
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,380
our

656
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,670
fish name on his back so you know the
question a.m.

657
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,580
this is crazy I can't see any of you but
I can see the red lights thinking

658
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:04,009
and occasionally a blue and when
someone's nervous

659
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,180
and

660
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,540
to the that checking workshops will be

661
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,270
going on now in the hardware hacking
village coming up

662
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,520
he hackerspace village the centers which
is the hardware hacking area

663
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,700
okay acid within our tracking area show
up around 1pm tomorrow

664
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,200
I or and I'll be there to help assemble
in that sorta stuff

665
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,380
out the for a basic

666
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,180
workshop and this is just enough to get
the badge assembled and have it working

667
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,509
and either Windows or Unix

668
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,250
the following day on Sunday there will
be an advanced

669
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,120
badge hacking workshop which will
involve as such things is

670
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,900
taking the firmware part where hacking
similar devices to the badges which

671
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,580
are not quite the badges if you'd like
to learn how to take products apart

672
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,830
if you would like to learn how to
reverse engineer the protocols involved

673
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,690
on these sorts of devices that will be
covered in the advanced workshop

674
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:05,010
admission is close the workshops are
default but if you do something to

675
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,950
impress me out

676
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,880
will push in anyways after Sunday

677
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,630
I can't handle a hundred people in
workshop

678
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:23,630
I can handle 10 and maybe 15 there

679
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,900
i'm open to bribes sped seeing as how I
haven't got my period

680
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,880
I'm I'm hesitant to believe that they
would calm your hardware Hector badge

681
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,390
hacking

682
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,879
kits are available either through me if
you find me

683
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,240
are Jimmy down the hardware hacking your
in the hackerspace village

684
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,640
or lady outta and fruit from

685
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,089
I was also wondering is one other thing
is anyone yet

686
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:52,430
written to your knowledge arm any kind
of

687
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,480
fake bad signal generators

688
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,440
not yet but if they would like to the
code is there

689
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,140
and it accidentally happens when people
rebuild the firmware from scratch

690
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,750
the way in which the from my works is
that the serial numbers last first

691
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,470
and then following the serial number
they are from Mars written on top of it

692
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,060
if the serial numbers not written it
defaults to -1

693
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,620
were all f's and I scenes and about as
walking around

694
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,970
makeup build a directional tracker for
you guys

695
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,910
I going later your badge

696
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,330
who yes next question

697
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:35,509
when placing the open beacon receivers
did you put them all in public areas or

698
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,270
are there some in the morning accessible
areas in the building

699
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,290
like two minutes times there's a lot in
every bedroom at the hotel

700

to talk about it a hardware/software
both both I mean anything

714
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,569
anything yes so where you guys hanging
out for the soccer their hardware is all

715
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,990
happening in the hardware hacking area

716
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:47,430
the hackerspace village on the mezzanine
and %uh EN Jimmy and many many other

717
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,759
people are really good at teaching
people soldering

718
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,910
it's really easy anyone can learn and I

719
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,029
everyone I i've taught well over 10,000

you whatever you wanna learn to

725
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,290
if you're interested in doing any
software development we're downstairs by

726
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:16,640
the

727
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,629

731
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:38,350
down the iraqi area totally open its
Stoli anarchy and though we were greeted

732
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:41,529
explosion hey I had two questions

733
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,980
%uh the first one is how far we can you
guys read

734
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,120
our information if we leave the building

735
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:53,140
or exist within the building

736
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,140
you can be read whenever you're within
sixty feet

737
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,400
a reader and any bats can be retold to
become a reader

738
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,630
so you won't be held in the database
outside the building

739
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:07,640
but sheesh if I read a coffee shop
running the software and you walk by

740
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,109
I would say that or a if you if you have
to also

741
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,610
register see Twitter name on username

742
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:18,260
things like that you know need some data
may actually pulled from Twitter that

743
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,100
associates you with

744
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,210
venues are visiting things like that om
there's a lot of people here

745
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,330
use the same handles everywhere user
name everywhere so

746
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,900
you know if you find you know that
you've set up

747
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,500
authentication and are going on you
you've clicked YES on those

748
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,650
auto fill on this website not manifested
for me

749
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,930
be your worldly any point data from
other sources

750
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,970
if if you allow us also this
intellectual research whenever an

751
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,370
instinctive Trillo

752
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,730
might be in this audience and basically

753
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,110
it's possible to do the same thing that
we're doing threw up in beacon

754
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,530
and MD except through the cellular phone
network

755
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,560
scheme used on any GSM phone worldwide

756
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,680
without the consent were knowledge

757
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:06,279
oppressing watch %ah so turn your cell
phone off to a few really

758
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,190
to attract

759
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,560
and then I S 01 E your guys I thoughts
on the

760
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,000
present and future use RFID such as and
drivers license

761
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,540
EZ Pass passed for products that we buy
inevitably

762
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,980
probably human beings

763
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,270
RFID devastated I'd like to answer this
one

764
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:36,360
I I am a man not a number wat I am 454

765
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,720
4873 295 USA

766
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,380
that passive RFID tag is just a barcode

767
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:51,030
and seeking the copy just like a barcode
there too many bar codes in our society

768
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:57,710
but it's not terribly different that it
works to radio yeah I normally they can

769
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,940
be read when you hold your passport up
to the

770
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,760
passport RFID reader but it's been shown
that people can read these numbers from

771
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,340
free pretty distances away but Annan of
we really have time to get into RFID and

772
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,700
its discontents here

773
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,510
but I think it is important to point out
that everything here is often

774
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,640
if you don't wanna participate at all
just take the battery out here that you

775
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,740
don't have to use the Website

776
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,940
of your super super paranoid it's lots
of fun for swap badges with someone who

777
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,950
doesn't wanna be tracked

778
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,110
next question aren't speaking of GSM

779
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,980
is actually wonder if these plants were
gonna start looking for radio signals

780
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,260
are not you're familiar with that

781
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,200
art project school on I was actually
wondering about the serial number

782
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,570
assignment badge hacking

783
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,110
kit that it said the NH B 12

784
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:54,470
was the best serial number to have I'm

785
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,650
says the firmware as presently published
on the website

786
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,530
is a for pax badges for the NHC 12

787
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,680
proper which is the version that I used
in the version that

788
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,700
the prototypes where DN HB 12 be

789
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,570
is now working and I can give you from
our image if you find me directly

790
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:15,660
so just

791
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,609
find me and I'll get you the firmware
for either botch my phone

792
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:22,880
yes this is his fault the duck

793
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,100
if you actually reverse engineer the
trial be things are a little bit

794
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,450
different

795
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:32,070
okay

796
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,780
I've got a question on troubleshooting I
got it bad that

797
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,300
will start initially run for about 15
seconds and I

798
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,790
yes that's the battery problem there is
half

799
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,610
film something over the positive battery
terminal

800
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:50,450
if you take a soldering iron into the
badges or to burn it off

801
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:54,580
by Skype considering I'm back and forth
then it will get a solid connection work

802
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,210
or you can rough enough for their flat
head screwdriver

803
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,370
or by inserting and removing your
battery

804
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:05,339
I had already tried inserting in
leg.-company nattering number of times

805
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,500
that may be off to try the restart Rick

806
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:14,500
we can help you okay Lake next question
