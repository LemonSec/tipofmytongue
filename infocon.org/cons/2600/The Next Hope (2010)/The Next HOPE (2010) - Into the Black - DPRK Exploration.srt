out to the person that was talking about

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,049

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:11,790

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,109
suck I am but let's begin with a
standard disclaimer

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,269
I largely the views and opinions and the
general ramblings in the stall

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,090
are largely my opinion not the opinion
if anybody dime affiliated with

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,660
and no wonder sears is one for dole
gramm said

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,489
and additionally if after this talk I
suddenly disappear off the face of the

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,149
earth please contact the North Korean
embassy in us to much folk I am

13
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,390
and they stopped kidnapping people in
about eighty seven miles south korean

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,610
and IT student was abducted in Austria

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,289

16
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,969
gonna if I disappear please let them
know sack

17
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,660
Iran let's begin with a couple quotes
one from george all

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,250
everybody's fiber favor to stop a call
for namely to if there's any hope it

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,400
must lie with the proles

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,860
and secondly from the wonderful
wonderful person is Kim jong-il

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,210
namely that he is an internet master
thats

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,159
not 9 usual bearing in mind that Kim
jong-il is a master of everything he is

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,130
in fact Superman

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,369
and needs a little cake anyway

25
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,340
who I well on as you may have guessed by
the very on American Axle I'm actually

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,180
from the UK

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,880
I i'm have not now not have ever been a
member of the communist party

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,658
does an important thing to say in
america I'm not now

29
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,090
nor have ever been an intelligence
operative at large because I liked the

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,659
prerequisite which is intelligence

31
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,810
and I have not been to North Korea and I
don't intend to go back because I don't

32
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,240
think I've ever come home again

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,860
and my pronunciation this talk will
probably be all kinds of wrong so if you

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,700
speak Korean

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,990
anti-tax about my mind and I'm also very
very sick and the whole cyclist

36
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,500
cycle fast site show logical such
warranties

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,090
truck bomb actually gonna be talking
about everyone

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,200
apparently according to Fox News is
terrified north korea

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,390
on his part the axis of evil which makes
it sound a bit like his

40
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,930
like it should belong in a Batman comic
an

41
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,010
basically die what is north korea's
stalinistic tighter ship

42
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,590
run by a week Wikimedia energy say an

43
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,360
is also an Internet by colin is much
that doesn't seem to have met dominique

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,530
10 techno technological systems attached
to it allegedly anyway

45
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,670
an going to be talking about

46
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,370
is an examination all external %uh
security

47
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,700
that surrounds north korea on also the
internal infrastructure

48
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,269
and also the weed international
relationships

49
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,110
and it might not seem to be about
watching this topic trying to his

50
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,260
and as much that North Korea is a closed
system like the ultimate class system

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,899
and examining closest is kind of
interesting what list of weren't going

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,420
about

53
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,200
is die there is no I don't stalk if you
wanna go directly

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,450
I'm amazed to see so many people here
actually because I thought you don't be

55
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,760
listening to how you know how to be
successful bastard which seems like a

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,870
much more interesting talk

57
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,580
and there's also no tactical commander
stock and hopefully there's no fair

58
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,800
lives inside is now over-inflated Fort
sack

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,810
when people think about North Korea
typically they think about couple things

60
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,470
and Monty Python's on Ministry of Silly
Walks

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,690
Minister military-style balkan a

62
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,150
strange we demand from Team America
global apocalypse

63
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,090
however there is a bit more channels
tree right now an

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:44,220
since I'll ask actors talk options for
first-time got to stop which is a mag

65
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,500
I know Chris actually news because north
korea's just remember there a war with

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,180
South Korea

67
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,319
and pics tend to forget tended to get up
but they're just remembered after 50

68
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,360
years us to wall

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,080
and as you may probably be aware I am

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,819
in March 2010 a South Korean warship was
destroyed in

71
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,760
international waters now lots of

72
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,760
conjectures around that whether or not
that was north koreans because you know

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,390
there was an anti talk radio show

74
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,560
well a bit and but alternatively for
just wander into US my nobody knows but

75
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,228
you know the back in the news which is
always good

76
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,289
which makes is topical sacked two parts
list of

77
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,919
and first part worried I'm gonna try and
get the

78
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,469
infrastructure comp a country daschle
about 30 saw its

79
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,000
still interesting and a second bit sec

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,630
and let's begin with Coach from the
socialist constitution

81
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,110
from north korea and the systems are
guaranteed freedom of speech press

82
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,419
assembly demonstration Association

83
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,820
if that sounds familiar just because
you've got Constitution

84
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,699
I'm from the UK but we kept sack

85
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,740
incidently I have notes was like our
membership suck

86
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,860
and what's most north korea about from a
technical perspective

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,850
well they don't have the Internet as we
as you United we know it

88
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,060
what happened is something called cream
Mac

89
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,389
which is basically a statement internet
for anything to get on that Greece also

90
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,250
has to go free various censure

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,370
false ass niggas through various

92
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,880
political Baltz and if it's not classed
as a French the regime all to enjoy a

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,990
Lord aid

94
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,520
in a stalling he gets on that and
promised

95
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,419
very limited very restrictive I'm using
so by a dick ACC's connections to serve

96
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,780
as in germany

97
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,850
suggest the germans like fascists you

98
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,250
sack

99
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,889
to talk about human young a bit more
detail by cyclic Pyongyang which are now

100
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,039
called brighter such

101
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,210
actually means a society the state

102
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,799
approved version the Internet you know
there is no lot there is no lo

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,300
lock out there is no one party there's
just lots of stuff sinkholes

104
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,069
k miss an according to Wikipedia

105
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,330
on this is a direct by ban all the
people you scream young

106
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,050
this is a free service for public use
now in a country

107
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,650
where the annual income is about two
thousand dollars a year

108
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,639
I very much doubt but many people have
access to like say

109
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,870
and if they do have access to it. can
actually afford to use this service

110
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,620
so I would actually tend to despues
Wikipedia's rose-tinted view the

111
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,270
universe

112
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,818
as well house a state-run internet very

113
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:33,090
at sharp turns also in the north koreans
used to be able to communicate by email

114
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,460
using a service called Citibank Citibank
the cleaners and I'm

115
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,160
used to be a back an outlook 2007

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,630
citibank is no longer online which may
suggest that north korea's not have

117
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,580
access to email

118
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,770
but open till 2007 that were gateways

119
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,340
from Citibank which is situated in a
province of China which allowed

120
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,460
North Koreans to use email suck

121
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,009
am for intel uses an earlier

122
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,800
you've got action react basically that
was launched in 2000

123
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,979
and reportedly consists of a browser an
email client

124
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,758
really really heavily filtered search
engine an

125
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,569
as I said earlier for for resource to
get home that is gonna get past live

126
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,789
regime sensors which is no mean feat and

127
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:20,909
us to quickly access but I'll service in
China bus aside

128
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,840
also via a dollop in Germany ought to
Germany

129
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,289
should cite and is very much still small
town basically think

130
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,940
a well on a mass scale

131
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,030
sack am as well house Andy the internal
internet

132
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,620
you also telephone to north korea and
basically

133
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,840
according to Marcus Noland there's a
telecoms researcher dialogue working now

134
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,030
about North Korea always makes anybody
can

135
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,669
and does about 1.1 million landlines in
north korea

136
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,750
which to put in a way is about 5 launch
a hundred people

137
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,169
so if you need to make an important call
be prepared to queue

138
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,080
and there were plans to expand tell Papa
Trowbridge

139
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,680
in 2003 however and 2007

140
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,800
the North Korean government decided to
giving people access to telephones is

141
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,750
probably not such a good idea

142
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,210
fact redford a or something darcy frey
typical

143
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,139
and why is our pitcher for the record on
finished a very attractive

144
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:25,060
up by cyclic and the only automatic
switching you'll find Telkom's is area

145
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,690
around pyongyang basically anywhere
outside Pyongyang

146
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,370
user's manual switching indeed and

147
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,029
most places in North Korea still use
manually land phones

148
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:40,110
so you know it's the hatch Lee picking
receiver Donnie number you perceive up

149
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,370
Frank A and that maybe dial a number
which maybe or maybe not

150
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,490
gets raped an

151
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,519
the ultimate switches are in use in
Pyongyang no

152
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,480
interestingly enough provided by Alltel
which is a French company

153
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,480
now you have a try to use French
technology to have my sympathy

154
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,510
moving up anyway apart from Sean Young

155
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,640
it is still possible for intellectually
to access the Internet as we know it

156
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,870
and 2005 does an organization called
ranch

157
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,250
which is basically been sold to help
North Koreans up the

158
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,220
rangeley north korea and they went into
covering after a bitch interests

159
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,330
drawn now really bright if to get some
pictures all

160
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,149
one of you cyber cafes around all the
information technology stall

161
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,290
snappy league titles as you may have
noticed it's not your typical

162
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,439
I am insect cafe in as much as there is
little man

163
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,510
whose sole job is to wander around and
look over your shoulder and chest you're

164
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,450
doing

165
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,850
which is better an it

166
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,709
the IT stall was one of the very few
state-sanctioned internet cafes

167
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,830
there are only two known about I was
opened in 2005

168
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,420
and charged banks allegedly anyway

169
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,910
20,000 mom now the average salary

170
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,980
is three thousand us have

171
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,200
gonna little bit disparity to there's
also another one

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,810
which is called the internet to PC room
which was set up by kemp you choose

173
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,810
and if you don't know mister who
basically sup something called Hoonah

174
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,700
which was on the north koreans attacked
gambit gaming site

175
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,990
but the date is a saw how well pat how
we doing for we can do that

176
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,310
tonight Lochan got a Chinese businessman
and help

177
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,360
am the service charges for that were

178
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,850
found ten dollars for an hour which
breaks down to about 1500

179
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,750
warm now's aside the average income is
about 3,000 more

180
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,690
so you know I don't know how much people
love the Internet by very much doubt

181
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,550
they're gonna spend a fortnight salary

182
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,490
I was used I am

183
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,910
as are saying earlier most of the
connections the outside world from north

184
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,370
korea go for Chinese I space

185
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,459
however you can also access the internet
directed by Saul

186
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,190
on sunlight connections are in use in
tourist friendly hotels

187
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,320
tourist-friendly is basically of green
coat for heavily booked by the way

188
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,519
and on because the expense involved us
all icons

189
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,810
they're not widespread all one thing the
is known about North Korea's that nobody

190
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,610
actually knows for certain how many
North Koreans

191
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,200
connect to the internet and how they do
so but

192
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,810
I would guess and the research up to
boxes of the very few day

193
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,089
and those that do highly highly
regulated apart from the upper echelons

194
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:32,190
yeah came to look at YouTube but nobody
else can

195
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,700
sack why is there a picture of a big
splash

196
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,220
this is because I am an 1986

197
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,589
Anna North Korea and the French again
cell

198
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,709
on compliment else %uh until such a
large

199
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:51,050
start TTT action dollar fall some like
TV effectively

200
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,690
an in 2000 know of 2000 Monroe the North
Korea joint

201
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,529
in Tulsa day were allowed independently
to join site like to meet

202
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:03,779
supply carrier compassionate like Carrie
organization

203
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,029
am since the eighties the north koreans
have been engaged

204
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,800
18 a subtle orbiting satellite program
called bright star

205
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,329
and game March 2009 they allegedly
launched a satellite which is quite big

206
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:18,860
deal

207
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,200
you know on the sachem about thirty
years an

208
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,440
however they launched and a claim to
take

209
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,649
checked according to and the US and
South Korea who

210
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,440
much myself exactly impartial when it
collapsed comes to North Korea also

211
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,930
consul russians what happened is a
launch date but then it fell into the

212
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,899
ocean

213
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:43,060
sigh not kinda vanilla putting such like
how successful launch

214
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,870
sack regards internet international
direct dialing

215
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,779
and as in nineteen ninety 90 there were
three direct line stitch upon

216
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,750
and 1995 has recently is that was born
direct line to your site

217
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,339
which was cut civility people iTunes a
an active AT&T a project for China but

218
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,279
not with north korea

219
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,790
Anna in 2002 I was a total of 56

220
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,980
international direct dialing times much
does one prove

221
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,940
for subsequent realize which is all
kinds of interesting

222
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,649
parameters regards in Section and
monitoring their old

223
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,510
which is possibly why in 2009 a the
north koreans decided to disable

224
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,829
Ridd connections track

225
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,870
if he wants to phone north korea should
you wish to do so

226
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,700
and you can come to the International
operates from that number that

227
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,060
and you can contact an couple of that
cellular carriers

228
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,730
den Dekker early and some that which
mail works and those numbers that

229
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,360
interestingly if you want to die North
Korea from outside the country there are

230
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,320
basically two numbers

231
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,610
and if you're in country and its 0238
said

232
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,949
a catchy phrase yet if you outside
country it's there

233
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:01,949
is there are two 38 wall on

234
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:06,060
thanks if you try and I'll north korea
all them

235
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,149
not from north korea you can always get
through to an operator

236
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,260
before you get connected which quite
interesting because it's a bit like

237
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,620
going back in time

238
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,720
as part the salk I did consider having
little bit award on and see what I can

239
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,620
find

240
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,720
until I realized a couple things one I
can speak Korean

241
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,670
which is better and two an

242
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,010
the the regime is not accepting

243
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,550
of phone calls to north korea basically
if you are north korean sexism

244
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,120
and you find friendly nations one about
where

245
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,290
weapon if you found serious not pro if
you from South Korea

246
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,290
you get shocked angina although I'm
interested in research I don't want

247
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,410
concept to getting people shopped

248
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,410
weirdly enough fact moving on sunlight
carriers

249
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,620
done that but there's also a GSM network
which was established by computer

250
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,949
Austral

251
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,100
girls come if you don't know them are an
Egyptian hotelier

252
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,620
affectively day built hotels that's what
they did

253
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,810
but they also did it GSM networks that
provided Pakistan

254
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,560
GSM networks in a foxhole you've worked
with former repressive regime

255
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,560
as tunable an

256
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,480
as a 2009 they're claiming and have
ninety thousand subscribers

257
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,510
which is fairly impressive considering
that that GSM network

258
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,949
only covers Jaya so you know and

259
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:30,709
is also fairly impressive when you
consider cost of mobile telephones

260
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:34,949
in north korea which biological ripped
off from China

261
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:41,050
and there's an interesting video about
heroes come online and fat apparently

262
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,130
is on from north korea however America
very much doubt it

263
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,500
and as marcia is dole local host IP but
if anybody's got any damaging

264
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,399
enhancement software I'd love to see
what that says

265
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,579
suck coming to the KCC KCC is actually
really important

266
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:02,370
KCC is basically the Korean computer
center and it's that

267
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,660
show-stopping world-beating Technical
Institute

268
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,259
was founded in nineteen ninety however
since nineteen nineties been

269
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,430
supplemented by branch offices

270
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,690
in Syria and China

271
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,920
United Arab our parents and Germany

272
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,860
China axis of evil Germany

273
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,759
say nothing and the German branch was
founded by

274
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,160
a guy called John holtzman whose %uh
rather charming looking gentleman on the

275
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,120
bottom

276
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,740
by city what happened was north koreans
guide million pounds and he gave him

277
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,720
nine service

278
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
site good deal and there

279
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,009
the case is patty published and a range
of software

280
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:47,269
which is not about public life and it's
gone on

281
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,519
more interesting it's got a number of
companies are actively trade from its

282
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,860
premises

283
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,730
an there's also something called the
Pyongyang informatics centre

284
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,050
which was established in 86 which is
when I believe that folks on my pants I

285
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,480
can

286
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,309
because if they're still using 46s
trouble be not only

287
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,859
suck because software an the call
substantial search engine components

288
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,000
Pyongyang

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,500
that got Korean writing program and the
got

290
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,369
gameplay programs they've got a national
program which I presume is the same as

291
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,189
came in it easily digestible for much
and they also have to own

292
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,730
de Faria I'm Linux distribution known as
red star

293
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,390
let's toss kinda interesting as much
that February this year

294
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,840
Russian blogger who's actually studying
action some university

295
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,949
by simply publish details about
government must

296
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,299
interesting things about apart from it
being Debbie bashed

297
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,700
is to and in the Read Me file there is
direct quote from ginger ale said

298
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,350
says you must create a system based on
the Linux kernel

299
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,678
in our Korean style so basically came is
a big Linux user

300
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,169
so if you have a min issues is creepy
shows up don't be at all surprised

301
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:06,240
now apparently Rockstar costs about five
dollars

302
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,710
am which trying to make six outside at
the

303
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,169
an expenditure of most North Koreans

304
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:16,900
especially since most shoppers north
koreans com even if all computers

305
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,780
so it's Derek directly targeted foreign
students

306
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,770
and that may be all kinds of interesting
monitoring software and there's a result

307
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,700
that senate and when things is known
about it

308
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,190
is that it's a bit flaky a colorful file

309
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,520
which kinda makes it somewhat similar to
most community-driven minutes destroys

310
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,950
I knew that after sino-u_s_

311
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,630
idiots exactly take the pain

312
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,910
I sack as well

313
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,010
house on the KCC produce injury and
software

314
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,260
they also have a number of foreign
companies actually operate from the KCC

315
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,539
and as a company called not attack which
was set up in 2009

316
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,470
answer basically provide outsource
software development site

317
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,590
%um software development chief captain
of Korea I'm sure be

318
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,600
trustworthy not attack interestingly was
founded by an expert are signed on

319
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,870
a call for cal/osha so after after
inventing padlock see them for how much

320
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,140
cash crude

321
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,669
I'm gonna and as you can see the north
koreans really

322
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,910
because I still using Windows XP in 2009

323
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,120
percent make some kind my spot like most
corporate entities out there in the

324
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,380
world

325
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,740
sack as well as not attack and is a
member

326
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,780
organizations that have offices in north
korea or

327
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,020
directly in the KC say an most
interesting images

328
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,150
on that is complete halt a truck to take

329
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,510
greater activity all swiss-based and has
a name suggests to text processing

330
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,559
what that means is I take back data and
in turn into

331
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,690
you select so in a if you use credit
card

332
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,240
be aware you critical factors going an

333
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,740
16 points now is in the UK we hang out

334
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,250
and a North Korean ambassador welcomes a
bit later on

335
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,460
has internet services provided by
british telecom

336
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,789
as you can see you know he's got really
good rest BT into next call

337
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,570
if you wish to bring him an expresso
distaste in his regime you said you can

338
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,129
Dave

339
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,580
and in get richer secretaries a very
lovely woman who have had many

340
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,639
conversations with all of which have
been too quick

341
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,200
with her telling me to go away and if
you want to visit his house

342
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,770
his and he lives in healing

343
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,260
which is a nice suburban London next
door is a dentist

344
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,629
and he loves lives on the end fashion
controllers is has a North Korean

345
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,090
fashionable

346
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,470
he also drives and he also drives a
Mercedes and

347
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,710
which is fairly interesting in as much
she comes from company

348
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,809
out front rear other where private car
ownership is basically punishable by

349
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,760
quite severe restrictions but

350
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,240
is nice to see the fam in 2014 him to
automation

351
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,710
dry ground atop the arrangement and

352
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,140
true is up it all comes back to Germany
I'm so not in a British

353
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,350
and as a rough time line here which %uh
try to get as much as I possibly can

354
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,039
however there's only so many hours I can
you survive looking completely demented

355
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,549
I'm gonna expand now bet online later on
bus my man

356
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,059
that's kinda temple bet most important
bit being in a

357
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,879
in nineteen ninety two Bronze Star
program so up in 2009

358
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
they launched a satellite which fell
into say

359
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,500
suck not coming to the infrastructure

360
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,360
as far as I know it announced talk it's
a bit more interesting

361
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,470
one gonna do in the second part space in
the present my ferry

362
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,140
very questionable research and

363
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,380
hopefully different perfume X sec

364
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,520
but give you something called the
mystery view 121

365
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,549
wiser picture captures the chicken
because

366
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,360
now because is always good presentation
practice top picture captures people got

367
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,679
are

368
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,559
and forget shit you are speaking suck

369
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,080
a may 2009 I was a guy called may just
see

370
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,879
Steve same at the US Army in cation
missing the I read that there is a guy

371
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,429
called major same

372
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:19,950
in the army not

373
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,710
he sounds like a poem character that's
all I'm say

374
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,559
he published a paper call us Napoli
title their skills enhancement is a

375
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,700
military-type

376
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,559
called the cyber threat posed by North
Korea and China to South Korean and US

377
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,899
forces Korea

378
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,720
street I'll stay basically and now he
discusses something called unit 121

379
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,169
now unit 121 fairly interesting is make
sure they're supposedly elite unit

380
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:49,350
the north korean military to solely to
dedicates to informational for

381
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,260
that's all day sauces updike's all the
Yonhap news agency

382
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,520
which flows if you don't know them all
the South Korean

383
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,059
state-sponsored news agencies bill on
the BBC's at a bit more vitriolic

384
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,700
and day apparently only interview to an
anonymous source

385
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,780
which is always useful and also and does
not

386
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,530
full-size cited knack called inside
DPRK's unit 121

387
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,899
which is written by John call Kevin
Coleman and published by defense Tech in

388
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,440
2007

389
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,179
to use a few times have you don't know
defense tack basically

390
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,600
up it's kind of like monster trucks same
parent company but is

391
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,100
it's like chops in the military and news
about the military in your even ventured

392
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,120
you baby killing machine something else

393
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,390
fastening iraq boys unit went

394
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,200
well apparently it consists of seventeen
thousand personnel

395
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,230
and which is on hopeful law you buy
axles

396
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,330
and there are currently all situated

397
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,770
n and the KCC you can apparently face

398
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,418
17,000 people and pizza and coke
Anjanette

399
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,409
very so the victim should not baptize
huge

400
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:07,890
French 17,000 in there

401
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:13,159
maybe shift workers banana who knows but
apparently the 17,000

402
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,380
which I even with Asians I guess is a
bit tight

403
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,590
now apparently according to Kevin and
they possess moderately advanced

404
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,580
distributed denial of service
capabilities

405
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,139
with moderate virus a malicious code
capital cities to seventeen thousand

406
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,929
people in one facility

407
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,289
who only moderate that's pretty track

408
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:37,260
you know there are 17,000 work hard

409
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,179
an are also apparently responsible for
attacking the West multiple times

410
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,409
and generally book being willing
technical managers on behalf K

411
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:50,380
and sadly apart from not particularly
independent sources

412
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,760
AG a South Korean news agency which is
sponsored by the government's

413
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,750
and yanked journalist an a confined any
credible

414
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,279
creditable and attributable souls for
the information about you

415
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,640
120 so I'm I contacted Kevin

416
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,890
I sit there said I was given a talk
about North Korea

417
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,870
I've heard about unit 121 it sounds
awesome what's going on

418
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,950
and you have your journalist where is
your attribution

419
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,179
Tribune and give me a source of some
description

420
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:23,789
coming up Maxima apparently the tone in
my email playoff

421
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,850
genetic yet to be contacted because
gonna I was apparently being very very

422
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,380
horrible by asking questions about
journalists a contribution

423
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,590
he also told me to Google North Korean
intrude upon which is kind of how I

424
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,360
found

425
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,539
he also told me to look at the
attribution at the July 4 cyber attacks

426
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,879
on the US soccer in the US but which
apparently point but not

427
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,490
after able to join the electoral for the
night he wasn't gonna tell me anything

428
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,690
because it's all classified

429
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:53,309
an app I company to neck which is useful
gap clothes if you're lazy journalist

430
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:56,320
an I got back in such insects hugely

431
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,740
come huge attributes attributes sauce

432
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,960
evidential materials you presented this
in the public like to do near

433
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,510
could you actually know tell people
where you got the states from the same

434
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,450
it was anonymous also can talk about the
cash on that

435
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,460
and she then told me to contact time of
our life and Steve sent

436
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,470
now this guy remember is an expert on
information

437
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,620
for for those if you don't have the UK
intelligence community work

438
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,020
MI five other people that responsible
for internal monitoring

439
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,080
I think he means is a march 6

440
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,740
for maybe an i5 are looking you know

441
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,720
UK militants and north koreans Anna

442
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,140
may be that busy and he also told me to
get such a major centre

443
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,600
that night and but yet problem dodge in
major cities using him as a salsa

444
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
basically is a source close to fuck

445
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,919
and so I basically said I carry
purchasing of trying to answer

446
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,510
5 I think I might tell me to fuck off

447
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,020
on thank you then he decided that unit
121

448
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,639
actually maybe unit 1 sack or possibly

449
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,919
unit 101 at which point I suggested that
unit 121 might exist in room 1

450
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,539
what I want which point he told me to
fuck off

451
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:20,700
and because I clearly had an agenda and
you know I was wasting his time

452
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,600
I do have an agenda is a happens attend
think if you're a journalist

453
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,850
whose reporting can shape national
policy and how people understand track

454
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,490
than you know so it's best to trying to
tell the truth not make sure all

455
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,059
in a nevermind the point is I don't wish
tough guy

456
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,490
a cabin however tempting it may be

457
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,100
and but the only sources are available
for the soup elite military unit

458
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,490
classified and was a skated and the been
presented as fact

459
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,919
interest in the cabin is a lovely man
according to Wikipedia the source of all

460
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,440
knowledge in the universe

461
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,200
he came up with the definition of
cyberterrorism he also

462
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,899
works for a company or is the update the
company to provide cyberwar training

463
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:10,700
so clearly has it now agenda in terms of
driving

464
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,220
people's exposure to you now inspection
of the capital to some of the country

465
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,890
also found interestingly is presented to
US Congress about five times

466
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,360
have you know people listening to this
guy

467
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,799
more interesting Doug he cancels any of
these allegations

468
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,809
which is fairly interesting I'm from my
perspective

469
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,309
kinda smells a bit like bullshit if you
work for a company

470
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:38,529
the cell cycle wat training an
approximate his training materials pace

471
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:42,350
site don't tell foreign nationals
computers panic attacks

472
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,779
and but up if you if you do that

473
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:50,409
and then your then inflating claims
which nobody else can prove

474
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:55,000
an act an just clarify I'm publicly
willing to stand

475
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,789
on rack alt and fight any of the e-mail
communications

476
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,000
anybody wants just because you know I
believe in attribution

477
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,950
offline now I will also publicly
apologize to cabin

478
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,140
if he is Raj to wear a t-shirt saying
Kevin is

479
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,240
or some I i'm wrong. please week me

480
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,750
I

481
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:23,710
however and shuttling I call bullshit

482
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,940
which brings down to Dex yeah

483
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,630
Grigorieva's hers world's number-one
hackers we all act Greg Greg rocks

484
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,930
do not disturb crack your small cabin
whose number one cycle or expand

485
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,620
world and don't spirit was kept kavner
as intelligent people

486
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,830
such that brings me onto the economist I
dunno ever and if you've actually

487
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,840
overlooks to read economists idle
warship by date

488
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,940
and shop talk about information officer
for

489
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,090
might be useful I miss go locally from
which is not completely known

490
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,080
contentious

491
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,120
doesn't show it doesn't show you great
and

492
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,420
any does coke bottles delete a comment
comment

493
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,390
lead to comment cycle which is hilarious
and there's also something called cyber

494
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,540
warned the 50-day mention now in that
one

495
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,930
claims cyberspace hockey cyberspace by
the way

496
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,940
does anybody know achieves exactly the
muzah

497
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,320
the troops to choose apparently have
become the 59

498
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,740
of a after land sea am spikes my
question

499
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,860
half they George Ernest own it'd be
difficult adidas attacks each other

500
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,270
doesn't cook love them various
propaganda sites out there

501
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,500
but in a warfare kinda means to somebody

502
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,020
Darvish made us we have implemented
notion what ways but you know somebody

503
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,430
get shot somebody dollars

504
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,400
day and so I don't know when you know
cyberspace

505
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,750
became a 15-9 apparently has happened
and

506
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,570
they also sacked to a lot could be
achieved by Gregs cooperation between

507
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,370
governments and the private sector

508
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,060
and which is interest cause

509
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,690
deems High Point ish I reckon is trading
of

510
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,060
can panic yet another stupid wall

511
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,960
can actually introduce real credible
change in and help the military

512
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,430
industrial complex along

513
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,520
let's face it we've we've had a warm
drinks helped

514
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,400
that was quite beneficial to industry
had a war on terror which is hilarious

515
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,360
when you think about

516
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,490
shit you're trying to attack abstract

517
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,610
K and now we have cycle which is even
more often extract

518
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,860
but in a if you worked for Blackwater
you can get excited we can hard in your

519
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,630
box isn't alone cost you $12 billion of
taxpayers money

520
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,650
so i i think im on that's what that
might be back and

521
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,830
they also cite one response to the
growing threat

522
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,820
cycle has been military iran claims have
the world's second-largest cyber army

523
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,020
to see not seen a but okay Russia

524
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,240
Russia Israel north korea best efforts
at their own rusher in israel probably

525
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,720
did

526
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,660
north korea house mixing this is a
country that in 2004

527
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,970
had such limited should fuel food and
fuel supplies

528
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,640
I K logical summer been halted by stay
but they had limited food supplies to

529
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,830
the extent that knowing

530
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,949
pin nine million people stopped def

531
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,200
I don't think they've got Relief Fund
cycle water

532
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,190
army and but you have regardless there
are still questions

533
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,580
attribution about if you want to read
the

534
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,320
economist articles I have links you
don't have to actually finance Pearson

535
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,909
International

536
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,150
you kind of suck and but you know
interesting points

537
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,840
tribution type why did because I like
sending emails cuz you know I have life

538
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,260
on I going search for the economist

539
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,230
I had to cancel from the public
relations department largely because

540
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,520
Pearson International fairly interesting
and as much there on out there is no

541
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,320
editorial point to contact

542
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,750
gonna let you know who to editors of a
more interestingly

543
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,840
all the pieces appear in economist on
named

544
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,820
an I have an issue if you don't know
who's written a piece

545
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,120
you don't know what their generous but
Khan's Pearson he makes some

546
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,900
impartial actor watch am sorry I don't
of Seneca I

547
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,450
what's your tribution is it the same as
Kevin Coleman inventing bullshit

548
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,710
free enough because that is an
international narrow the Financial Times

549
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,610
unit bolanger us they didn't actually
get back to me Anna

550
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,920
which brings me back to my point about

551
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,220
what the fuck is going up now

552
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,120
I think what's going on here
particularly in relation to north korea

553
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,850
a is you stay something that nobody can
prove or disprove

554
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,330
now use if you ask questions is
classified if you have more questions

555
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,570
it's not which

556
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,740
if you ask more questions peaceful you
don't watch that claim

557
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,420
make press and you done reinforcers
flames

558
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,910
you that much watch those claims being
of course I mean look at this is found

559
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,260
interesting is she started off in
defensed

560
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,580
which isn't a widely read publication it
then spiraled and

561
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,870
after reinforcement of duck sauce to
appear

562
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,649
in the economist has also been hilarious
fox news articles about North Korea

563
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:09,129
which

564
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:12,129
genuinely hilarious and which

565
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:16,120
one sees me more press panic specs and
if you can spread panic

566
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,839
you can spread spending which means that
you have Blackwater get a shitload

567
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
federal money

568
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,649
an app which means if you're involved
Blackwater you profits

569
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:28,879
and that's why I suspect this is about
us about driving panic it's about

570
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,649
only informed Fort generally making
people fat and rich

571
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:37,069
which is also am which is why my
response

572
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,179
to the economist and its Pissin
international is very considered

573
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,649
at Denver install to make they can go
fuck themselves especially if they're

574
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,819
going to claim things

575
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,919
clearly based upon triplets on
attributable sauces

576
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,120
incidently if there are any lawyers from
Disney in the room Dempsey

577
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:59,150
because I had fact

578
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,310
Kevin told me to get into to do some
research

579
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,810
on July 4 cyberattacks started cousin I
do untold

580
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,520
an unfortunate didn't start in July 4 so
is like in life I can actually start on

581
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,660
July 1st

582
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,819
but close and basically what happened

583
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,040
is walls a widespread a DoS attack

584
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,860
against 25 suffering financial
institutions

585
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,270
and high-value high P all

586
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,530
targets in the USA in a the White House
the Treasury Department

587
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,070
ship the people heard of an

588
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,920
they were quickly heralded by the press
and buyers are the people

589
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,840
as being conclusive proof of the evil
leaked

590
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,930
North Korean hackers am Karim sup

591
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,379
actually decided to investigate before
making any claims

592
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,520
and I refer to Sampson who have any
security company who did some amazing

593
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,080
work on this call back I'll an

594
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,840
mean helped America have and basically

595
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,910
yes anybody here had pizza fixed

596
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,170
respond page he K st. Paul a

597
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:14,010
yet Republican mission have Michigan
House Intelligence Committee

598
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,140
yeah he really is films ca

599
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,470
for those if you don't know about a
lovely lovely pay

600
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,330
basically this is the guy set in 2006
that

601
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,450
you know date found WMDs in Iraq

602
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,320
now I kinda did not wanna make use

603
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,730
especially UK which kinda pissed off
about being dragged into yet another

604
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,650
piece of

605
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,890
in we it's not so much the glory ship in
the back up light

606
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,089
they had major credible threats we just
heard I think

607
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,830
but currently about this attack and this
is awesome suspects were

608
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,730
next I'm not going and shoot down a
banking system all the manipulate the

609
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,760
electrical connector

610
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,960
are here awesome in South Korea all
trying to scuttle

611
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,460
miscalculate and people will be killed K

612
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,650
a couple points you say

613
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,690
that they're going to shut down banking
system okay

614
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,750
big news efficient and banking system
people do not dollars

615
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,360
I have been to an ATM when I've been
happily overdrawn and it hasn't given me

616
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,240
any money

617
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,620
I am Not Dead

618
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,759
I think she and this is just me thinking
here

619
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,060
maybe what happens if if that happens
you rich person

620
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,200
they dodge I have all civil

621
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,770
few can I reach people access to that
forms

622
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,140
fate Ali the Duchess cuff ok

623
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,850
and companies don't know the keel over i
think thats what pizza believes

624
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:46,569
which is interesting shame it's not true

625
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,590
anyway and the wonderful wonderful
people back hella

626
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,660
a sec to some amazing work and they got

627
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,259
access to to the eye trying to control
samples

628
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,220
which work despite responsible for the
botnet was in use

629
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,070
and its looking good thing the US didn't
retaliate to this one

630
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,190
the calls the to serve as a shout

631
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,490
am one of which was located in new cash
some doubles

632
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,730
on bomb lamb was located in Miami suck

633
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,890
gave an

634
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,190
the warm own 1952 ninety don't wanna a
woman ok to

635
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,390
an is now known no that pit bulls and
basically was a VPN

636
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,240
pipe sup long to complete call to global
digital broadcast

637
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,600
him except boxes and basically tied by

638
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,509
via VPN server Miami now

639
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,440
case other was in Brixham USO was in
miami

640
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,750
now my sense a geography isn't breaks

641
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,320
but not for Bryson know miami is in
north korea

642
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,790
I think anyway

643
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,859
good thing at people checked before
making wild in

644
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:02,350
on justified likes Peter

645
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,680
sup what was it well the botnet was huge
was about is lots

646
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,930
massive I think there's like 78 out
leaks

647
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,100
am so very big very clever not lack

648
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,200
not so big not so clever basically it
was

649
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,410
ripped off my Dinh Chi from 2004

650
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,149
and it seems to have been cobbled
together from a number sauces

651
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,260
and made absolutely no attempt at all to
bypass I pay

652
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,470
and was probably written using Korean
language play

653
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,890
interesting when you compare that to
Chinese in a great pigeon

654
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,299
when I started it was very much cobble
together a nap

655
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,970
steal a bit less tale about together
whoever's got

656
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,100
and so kinda similar to that an

657
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,279
that potentially could be a clue to
origin

658
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,940
if you are a super leaked military hack
from north korea

659
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,290
are you going to use ripped off code
makes no attempt to obfuscate self

660
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,980
are you gonna write you like the dolls
and actually has an impact

661
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,420
and hasn't picked up by notch I am

662
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,060
I have just saw I am maybe Chinese

663
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,540
maybe it's American maybe somebody who
South Korean Isla and his living

664
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,580
in points in I don't act the problem is

665
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,170
am it's more interesting than it first
appears because

666
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,280
it was directed against financial
institutions in South Korea

667
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,720
and a couple pipers high possibility
targets in the US

668
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,400
if you own the north koreans are you
going to attack the white

669
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,040
X probably not because you know that the
americans have got bigger toys

670
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,040
you know to have nuclear weapons that
work and satellites which actually older

671
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,450
two chicks

672
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,500
I type

673
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,380
I maybe it was just something South
Korea's trying obfuscate ships going

674
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,670
South Korean banks iraq suck

675
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,820
brings me to my next point in 2004

676
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,770
does a South Korean general to compare
the skills by seven of Korean stirred up

677
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,070
the CIA

678
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,650
so if you follow the logic here just the
CIA

679
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,840
only have moderate virus right indeed
skills

680
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,980
but now and %uh obviously has been
disputed by number of

681
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,570
experts in inverted commas most notably
john Pike

682
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,920
and also from the end of the National
Intelligence Service

683
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,040
of South Korea's turnarounds trash sorry
about the generally get

684
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,930
gasket sometimes suck

685
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,850
and earlier this year an in June in fact

686
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:33,210
that was another South Korean general
something about soccer in general yes

687
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:37,440
I'm the base hit the sack da the and g20
meeting

688
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,430
in Seoul in November probably be heavily
targeted by North Korean hackers

689
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,430
now I don't know but for anybody
remembers Ian Tomlinson in this country

690
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,569
on and you can just got killed in
Taunton he was walking home from work

691
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,580
had nothing to do with the g20 Perseus
and a lovely lovely frantically school

692
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,569
so you can see that being friendly

693
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,950
and by city pushed him over and had a
heart attack so technically

694
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,460
I don't think it's just the north
koreans have %uh have a problem with the

695
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,640
g8 g20

696
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,100
doing shit like that I kind of a bitch
have been issued

697
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,250
check moving on

698
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,550
Truex a psychologist from the bash a
crazy

699
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,960
which economies an

700
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,040
lovely lovely neo-con Scott place on the
compulsion Sox

701
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,200
I have now pointing the finger up north
korea for

702
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,359
the Gulf oil spill that truth

703
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,890
and this is proof remember and was at
the Deepwater

704
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:37,270
a Horizon oil platform was bills by high
and I have industries

705
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,440
to watch South Korea so there are some
action and thus

706
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,200
wonderful session which brings in now
logic at all

707
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,550
is a good desertion is a Suicide Squad

708
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,060
I i have to do to get Suicide Squad
hours of my

709
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,630
aboard a submarine in north korea drove
disappearing

710
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,510
from north korea for US waters without
anybody noticing

711
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,870
cushion after having fun stealth
capacities clearly

712
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,460
and then dollars bond the oil rig

713
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,990
I am it doesn't seem particularly
credible but you may ask

714
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,359
and I don't any word on possible by
Brent North Korea were involved

715
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,920
Tony Hayward is in a Los and I apologize
wholeheartedly for

716
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,500
week 18 to fact

717
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,520
10 things I wanted to do was call the
shop was actually look

718
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,560
some the crack all the bad shit stuff
that surround north korea

719
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,790
on things I'm north korea's really good
a is getting foreign nationals to buy

720
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,240
institution self-reliance I dare

721
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,590
in a can join you not a lunatic in about
a week he's actually very nice map

722
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,740
and 2.2 have a number propaganda site
scattered around

723
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,930
plaque and according to research is
alleged to be about 30 of them

724
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,120
are tracked down 19% of which 18 net

725
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,810
and all that wonderful titles like in a
the anti-imperialist

726
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:01,560
National Democratic Front which sounds
like it should be from the Life of Brian

727
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,870
anyway the servers and this is fairly
interesting

728
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,470
most people would think north korea
north korean pro pro-north Korea

729
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:12,750
servers gonna be in China new most of
them again

730
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,700
in Germany who six in Germany five-inch
time for in China

731
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,030
to in the US and one in Spain

732
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,250
Scianna York still winning

733
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,630
and how the breakdown heiress

734
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,250
deprecated versions and I S and very
deprecated versions of Apache but mostly

735
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,390
Apache cya

736
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,629
kim loves open source as well as Linux
and

737
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:41,070
page page page most the software use
this usually book light on

738
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,880
an a couple look

739
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,160
I said look sup truly beautiful stadium
access

740
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,190
and most interesting was custom Java
component

741
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,490
which was trying to obfuscate from
public view

742
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,010
which I wasn't actually bright enough to
attempt to reach pop or decompile should

743
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,020
check

744
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,840
also this on one of the sites to some
tickled pink to resident nope

745
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,090
pic 2 B's on this exists on the same

746
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,290
cycles would as a wordpress blog site

747
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:15,100
good amount come on after is supporting
WordPress and be a cake to is little man

748
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:15,710
sent

749
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:20,560
think up Kim Il Sung Min Ho before I
decided to become a song

750
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,930
and there's no mention pack 2 anyway
basically its

751
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,660
about looks to be a book standard CNS
control system

752
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,270
and a site no reference to anybody could
be kind of interesting

753
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,980
and I reckon it's fairly tribute to Paul
sup

754
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,060
find this is not to on

755
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:43,170
attack the lunatics a bill pro-north
Korea circus

756
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:47,440
my phone as an all of them appear to be
running deprecated software

757
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,530
all of them got extraneous services
enabled

758
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:54,240
and most of them susceptible to number
Comics app actors

759
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,470
now although I dunno servers or
applications and hosted in north korea

760
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:03,140
their affiliated with north korea if
North Korea is some really

761
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,339
and so actually ninja whitewater story

762
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,260
rs4 just 24 am

763
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,260
now public think she would fall be a bit
more secure

764
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,570
now he could be doable of it could be
because the servers and managed and

765
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,010
controlled by

766
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,109
effectively lunatics all big

767
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:25,759
he could be and the factor

768
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,290
in a there isn't a technical aptitude
because others in the access to current

769
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,060
technologies

770
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,819
because they live in a repressive fucked
stalinistic

771
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:37,640
an ultra also interesting if there's a
guy called

772
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,049
top talent here please get in touch was
apparently never which is

773
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,190
a major soccer north Korea has got
sequel injection

774
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,890
I can't fucking find it so you know if
your he let me know where he's

775
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,759
sack my conclusions I have conclusions
are wielding

776
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,130
when it comes to North Korea

777
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,930
and it's got very very tight tightly
regulated use my city

778
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:02,660
find and share our about North Korea's
key halt

779
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,700
and is also incredibly poll in at the

780
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,500
the financial ability of North Korea to
invest in technology

781
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,270
doesn't exist an article for more
important things to spend the money on

782
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,150
elections

783
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:19,819
fortress of solitude and they've also
got an evil little shortage

784
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:23,069
and the problem is having an evil little
shit in charge is even a little shit

785
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:24,069
doesn't mean the people

786
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:28,450
he's in charge of to realize the city
shaped sent the fertile shape restricts

787
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,230
access to technology

788
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,870
if you may notice issue now

789
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,310
seems kinda credible the north korean
military maybe

790
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,850
thinking about information is cheap and

791
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,100
anyone going on a room and fat pipe in
we

792
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,480
am dot said I'm

793
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,700
mice my suggestion is their skills gap
because

794
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,220
you don't have open access to
information if you don't open access to

795
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:54,880
information

796
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,339
is very difficult to launch tax could
you come find out about them

797
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:01,730
and a few its standard dinner so there
may be thinking about

798
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,740
outsourcing two channels perhaps problem
and outsourcing to China

799
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:10,319
china owns more US bombs in the US so
China not going to for protecting his

800
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,720
costume

801
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,440
so I'm maybe my point here and the
important point about this instead of

802
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,380
worrying about digit llama get

803
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,410
which by and large seems to be hope
helpless least inflates it you know

804
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,970
there is no allied electric pole up
trees cut down

805
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,859
maybe people should be concerned about
the human rights record north korea

806
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:33,140
and the fact that there's an evil little
shift incharge

807
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:40,140
ample saxophone fuel

808
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:48,410
questions/comments random abuse Korean
desktops

809
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,810
shakes

810
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:59,220
I one big question so I've noticed that
that are so North Korea does have

811
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,569
aid they do have it a TLD himself like
dot

812
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:08,800
K something don't care yeah know it no
no no Kuni South Korea

813
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,339
yeah so I thought it was very strange
how none other domains are using or

814
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:13,799
using Doki p

815
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,550
I mean shouldn't and should not be like
the first step in setting up your server

816
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:18,450
infrastructure

817
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,660
on an amino in to an end for them once
they're hiding like

818
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,060
you know Korea dashed DPR to dot com
should be like

819
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,220
you know support to support the troops
to Katie yeah

820
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,060
all so I mean some ya that's why I guess
I'm just curious why you think there's

821
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,230
why they haven't by them on set that up
yet

822
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:41,220
who knows and Mike Jackson is a gas in
its agenda so position on my part was it

823
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,160
would be to do

824
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,220
actors to do Houston I'm career is down
with the idea softer line check

825
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,920
alcohol douche philosophy is all about
we can grown vegetables we can run

826
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,140
errands on the phone at Le Spa
predictions

827
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,730
on but down to self-reliance and purrs
you

828
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,450
because russia has to be export rated
ash

829
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,370
that goes against the whole mindset of
girls getting salt mines

830
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,310
the country as a whole in a I would
suspect is one incident

831
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,339
now because involves opening show for
their

832
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:16,730
which they really don't wanna do that if

833
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,890
other I'm I'm also from the UK may be a
bit further

834
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:23,609
north for yourself as you all know the
UK of Scottish

835
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:27,700
sorry was enough I have your own
parliaments and everything

836
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,069
of Oxfam daaaamn

837
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:35,500
over friend in UK who's in the match
maybe he knew twenty people on Deepwater

838
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,160
Horizon

839
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,899
when it blew up and then they confirm it
was in fact a North Korean submarine

840
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,859
that bombed it served us from I've

841
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:46,040
yeah it was a had nothing to do with
soapy maintenance and I know that a yes

842
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,940
photos and everything

843
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,000
yeah yes I'll yeah um

844
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,700
and you mentioned the and the embassy in
London earlier which seems like a very

845
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,900
amateur operation because I'm I'm

846
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,069
aside enough but so too have looked up
on street view and found to have a

847
00:50:59,069 --> 00:50:59,819
basketball

848
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:03,609
bring in the back guardsmen you can even
find Daily Mail court error

849
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:06,580
to save from the neck so neighbours
think the corporate on things like bin

850
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,370
collection here is my first

851
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,740
feeling and Juliana oh yes oh and have
%um

852
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,920
been there to check if they have any on
secured wireless networks inseparably

853
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,150
that Compton in the embassy

854
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,870
Manny I

855
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,370
on that solar cooking steak I

856
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,470
but I may have been tailing it may have
been dark I'm and

857
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,839
backtracked and you may have been
renting the house opposite

858
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,029
new no I'm avatar how

859
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:39,350
but that's all I'm willing to say

860
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,580
anybody out there so you post that the
reason for

861
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,279
cyber warfare is to create money for the
military official complex

862
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,660
do you think you could be also for Craig
wish to control the net take control

863
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,700
away from this isn't a government

864
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,740
what budget think day you know that
their

865
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,839
creating this bullshit this bullshit is
all about control

866
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,650
one of the things that's in the
Economist article is we must control

867
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,630
digital army

868
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:09,220
each which Harris billionaire now if you
can never transcription

869
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,609
all here forget assembly because
according to economist

870
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:16,130
to life you know simply and but does
what it was what is back

871
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:19,650
is about enforcing regulations we fear

872
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:26,650
as well as driving profit and that's how
this shit works

873
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:31,230
run quicker cracka unless you are
bringing beer

874
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:35,050
so one thing that was not on your that
shit crazy list was

875
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,120
common thing

876
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,480
about North Korean counterfeiting mmm

877
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,640
and I'm curious if you think that the
laundromat recruiting department

878
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,569
or if there's something there on a
strictly

879
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:53,270
ion because all of the

880
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:57,800
shall we say the political viewpoints
over North Korea dem may well be engaged

881
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,640
in so fun account spitting that
perfectly situated

882
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,299
with within easy reach the Golden
Triangle and Gina

883
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:09,120
people-smuggling happens at when it
comes to traditional crime they may or

884
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,830
may not be important because you know

885
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,960
they're effectively a group stage and
for

886
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,859
I think that's far more credible you
have to North Koreans are coming to

887
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:19,240
destroyers with DD

888
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,310
cycle skills to be fair

889
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:28,460
anybody else are we don't appear to be
done fantastic

890
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,670
Sep onto some references here the most
important moment in the last

891
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,460
all Human Rights Watch and Amnesty old
Amnesty International
