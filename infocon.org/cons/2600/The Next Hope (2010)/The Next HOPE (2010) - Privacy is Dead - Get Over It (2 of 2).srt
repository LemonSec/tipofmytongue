anytime I want those 11 box

47

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,970
everybody years experience that what you
don't know who's

49
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,329

50
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:12,720
rental or lease agreement or sale deal
with these

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,049

so on and so forth

55
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,630
now or the address on this

56
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,700
when I talked about this in 2008

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,150
some were easily she'll for Tom no's
pizza

58
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,540
put up a a posting saying

59
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,090
my mom couldn't provide a copy of the
dominoes database

60
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,209
no I don't have a copy at dominos
database

61
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,480
but I did say that they share it with
law enforcement as those Papa John's

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,799
as those Ginos pizza as those everyone
else

63
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,320
and I have to tell you I stick by that

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,239
by the way here's a sample bill that I
use the case

65
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,280
which I got by checking the database

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,650
and then going to the pizzeria ROM bombs
first law

67
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,459
BB of course beer or bomb is what every
day do you put out there

68
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,010
will eventually be used for an on
intended purpose

69
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,300
what you put it out there its core and
eventually it will be sucked into

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,220
something else

71
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,660
pizza purchases perfect example you use

how you paid ninety five bucks a year
you gave them everything including your

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,009
biometrics

90
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:45,009
Secure Flight one at a business but all
the information information you gave

91
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,199
about them

92
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,289
no gave to the now in a marketing
database

93
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:55,139
this is a scary thing I talk about

94
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,009
gay lifestyle lot when I give this
lecture not because I'm opposed to gay

95
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,189
lifestyle really couldn't care less

96
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:04,240
but because a lot of people really

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,949
are in the closet a lot of people don't
want their sexual orientation no

98
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,650
here is a magazine that solicited
subscribers

99
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,889
among essentially young guys in the
closet

100
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,479
teenagers young 20's very vulnerable
people

101
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,938
they have millions and millions of
records and website hits

102
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:30,080
and subscription think their entire
history with the magazine went bankrupt

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,659
so no marketing companies are going to
be bidding

104
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,090
on their sole remaining asset their
database

105
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,259

106
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,460
let's talk about your purchases

107
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,599

108
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,870

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,219
on your health insurance plans based on
your shopping history

113
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,669
you buy a couple six packs a week you
buy a lot a fairy foods

114
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,349

115
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:23,250

116
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,129

118
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,030
but that's an example of what's possible
unintended use oven for

119
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,479
now let's talk about tracking you down

120
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,008
second holy grail of an investigator
where is he

121
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:51,370
where is she where can I physically fine

122
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,289
this is the old way every time you boot
up or are

123
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,509
a microsoft program reported to the
mothership

135
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,730
even your Wii reports what you doing how
well you did for where you did from

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,220

141
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,350
so they could track a core and use the
mic in the car

142
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,360

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,160
so if my iPhone says that I am

158
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,319
to bars away from browser

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,470
from from router 1,2,3,4,5

160
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,400
and four bronze away from you know
wireless node

161
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,050
four five six seven eight you can tell
where I am within feet

162
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,610
within feet

163
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,860
I'm not even going to trigger fish were
running late but basically

164
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,290
I can track your phone into thinking
that I'm a Seoul Tower

165
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,209
so you can report your location and give
up in full

166
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,990
and the phone companies or on
embarrassed to tell you about this

167
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,330
you can turn on your kids locator

168
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:08,660
you can have your cue track 24 /7 a
report to your website

169
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,069
MapQuest those plugins very well as
plug-ins their services like mall or go

170
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,510
go

171
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,250
by the way PI's by a cell phone with Mo
logo on it

172
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,070
they put it in our box with a couple of
magnets the sticker on your car

173
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,900
and reports everywhere your car does
because it's only anonymous

174
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,570
you find that thing under their you can
track it back to the PI

175
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,030
little bit have PRI secrecy doesn't
matter if I tell you not to be checking

176
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,069
for

177
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,760
soccer's I'm

178
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,439
Apple for Apple uses GPS and skyhook

179
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,490
with with an iPhone I can tell where you
are

180
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,320
within feed I can tell not just that
you're in this room

181
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,730
but who's sitting around you I can tell
who you have dinner with

182
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,220
in a restaurant not only that because
have programs

183
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,550
that index every address and every
business

184
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,230
and every residence by GPS I can tell

185
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,130
remotely whose house you're in what
restaurant urine

186
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,290
if it's a strip club if it's an abortion
clinic

187
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,750
I can tell all of that against your will

188
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,940
his examples express there's a more

189
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,040
there's a parking lot NAVTEQ is one of
the best examples

190
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,709
I spoke about this is the last one at
the last hope

191
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,410
worth mentioning again worry mine in
israel developed a program called rabbi

192
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,420
RA abri stance for

193
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,219
always forget this relationship in
activity analysis and behavior and

194
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,510
former

195
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,020
what that does is it follows your cell
phone

196
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,260
it tells me you're here so-and-so was
there with you

club

198
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,900

205
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,060
god bless their little plagiarizing or

206
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,910
stole the exact quote for an article

207
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,750
so votes a little search in your pocket
she they thought of themselves

208

reports location inactive reserve a
subject behavior patterns & Associates

209
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,160
here's an example let's look at a sample
thing

210
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,300
know by the one Italian mob guys are the
only people

211

fifteen minutes later Don Vito shows up
what does that tell you

215
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,480
somebody in there picked up the phone

216
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,550

Eduardo the mood the mule Ruiz

225
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,690

atwater the mule is a

226
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,800
drug mule two days later undercover
narcotics officers

227
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,030
begin to notice the availability of a
new type of colombian cocaine

228

229
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,560
guys this is this is real

230
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,100
this is an example but even more intense
uses a happening

231
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,640
every day every day this is a ridiculous
example

232
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,830
but this is doable easily doable

233
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,060
I can watch your cell phone I can see
who you hang out with

234
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,160
who you care about what is because you
talk to them

235
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,770

okay the computer says only call booty
call

239
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,390
become our

240
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:59,790
he is a US program that came out USA USA
counterpart is called nomad

241
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,120
well what they say ability to profile
target behavior

242
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,040
rules own gins to extract patterns in
order to fires

243
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,370
easy to use not assume technical genius

244
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,480
applies to a lot of FBI agents

245
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,900
his example profiling a target

246
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,490
shows there for cell phone so use the
Sims the use

247
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,490
even if they swap out locations they go
to

248
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,620
the email addresses the use what they do

249
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,490
their landline phones

250
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,520
ridiculous compares Telecom's behavior
of target

251
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,850
with other known behaviors

252
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,530
the fingerprints you and I gotta tell
you guys it's really easy to do

253
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,490
searches for deviations a normal
behavior

254
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,640
own first you go two way

255
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,160
Home Depot where you make a purchase
over shuffle

256
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,780
then you're seen in the park in the
middle of the night

257
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,178
for four hours following which

258
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,380
your girlfriend cell phone goes dark

259
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,159
very hard to figure you can tell if a
target has passed this phone on to

260
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,659
somebody else why

261
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,730
the behavior the user changes
dramatically

262
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,929
your cell phone as a fingerprint who you
are

263
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:28,520
here is an actual honest-to-goodness
screen shows everywhere you go on

264
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,158
everything you've gone

265
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:34,360
related IP addresses related physical
addresses everything

266
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,539
this is the information they publicly
released

267
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:43,299
now by the way for a test there and a
billion records today

268
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:46,990
for seven days it's a test matter what
they do for you

269
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:52,090
P the money by the way there's a new
federal term

270
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,600
for those %uh view they're doing things
that you shouldn't fewer described as

271
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,230
being part of a community of interest

272
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,310
it's not a romantic term means a group
interviews who generate a majority of

273
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,770
their traffic on calls

274
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,420
to other members of the group traffic is
defined as a quantitative measurement

275
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,840
above the total measurement of blah blah
blah sis boom bah

276
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,879
it means if you're talking to three more
guys all the time

277
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,140
they start watching you

278
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,400
here's an example actual

279
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,560
anonymized example or by the way

280
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,590
whole areas then this program

281
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,220
this analysis program to harness the
guard name is called guilt by

282
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,000
association

283
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,250
nobody's trying to hike with the kids
own

284
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,340
I'd here financial activity extrapolated
out

285
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,770
here is relationships and financial
activity and the guy in the middle

286
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,030
that's dont veto lasagna or who every
lawyer's

287
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:59,040
now by the way real-world

288
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,200
there was a terrorist in milan

289
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,070
beautiful Milano he didn't go there for
La Scala you want their er to recruit

290
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,129
people

291
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,530
and his name was Hassan Mustafa Osama
nassir

292
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,740
dodi's a terrorist now you know for sure

293
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,150

295
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:30,450
they sent a bunch a CIA guys they're 26
people

296
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,640
I'm a colleague of these people sort
embarrasses me to say

297
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,130
they went there with consecutive
driver's license numbers

298
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,410
or for any ideas consecutive driver's
license numbers

299
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:48,390
all from certain locations in Virginia
Maryland

300
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,470
they went there with god help us
consecutive amex numbers

301
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,080
they went there with consecutive cell
phone numbers

302
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,169
so what happens advance creatures up

303
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,350
for guys jumper stick a needle in

304
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,840
mister nice was not miss the nasa goes
limp

305
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,750
that roam in the van of to go nassir
later magically shows up in Egypt

306
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,440
US government is very good for
outsourcing things including torture

307
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,700
this is called an extraordinary
rendition inferred torque

308
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,740
which means we're gonna have somebody
torture the crapper you

309
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,470
which was not allowed to do it ourselves

where you spend time your activities

339

340
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,700
everyone is in it that this is this is
from a marketing quote

341

server but ours was

349
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,139
like airlines a Las Vegas hotel and by

351
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,570

352
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,320
you always have your cell phone with you

353
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,370

that you can do that

358
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,570

365
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,240
think about that okay some people are
scratching their heads are other parts

366
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,210
of their bodies

367
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,860
I'll tell you it's so you can turn the
phone off

368

369
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,530
if you check you will see you cannot go
dork with an eye for

370
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,260
the only way you can do that is put in
one of those old film safe bags and

371
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,990
clothes that are

372
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,460
now having said that

373
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,210
Steve Jobs recognizes there in this is a
Google statistic

374

375
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,770

380
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,090
Apple Apple doesn't have a Google search

381
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,550
doesn't have a blog search it's going
with what it has

382
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,639
which is it has an incredibly functional
phone that most of the people in this

383
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,809
room carry

384
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:04,540
and they own you because that for let's
look at some of these programs

385
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,780

pizza coupons are gonna pop up when you
walk past the pizza store

391
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,820

juice

392
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,210
for 324 a better deal than a 12 in
scoring for 294

393
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,880
hey that's real that's real handy but
what it owes the most what you're buying

394
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,690

everything that you use the phone for

398
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,320

significant

399
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,280

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,730
why ru you may ask yourself

403
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:17,670
why did Apple span $765 million dollars
for mobile advertising company

404

407
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,800
Apple buys voice search startup series

461
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,510
your entire cell phone location history
available to the FBI without a warrant

462
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,379
it's not your information it's the phone
companies information

463
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,250
it's their business records John Q
Special Agent

464
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:26,230
walks into sprint answers I what bob's
location history for the past month

465
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,570
Sprint is perfectly able to go hear you

466
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,299
and by the way if you read the newspaper
the newsweek article where they stole my

467
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,049
title

468
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:38,730
they talk about it excruciating detail

469
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,360
the FBI appears to have begun using a
novel form of electronic surveillance in

470
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,010
criminal investigations

471
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,030
remotely activating a cell phone's
microphone

472
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,470
and using it to eavesdrop on nearby
conversations

473
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,700
this technique is called a roving bug
and was approved by top US the OJ

474
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,460
officials

475
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,610
actually that's not what a roving
buggers roving book is that they

476
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,000
wiretapped every phone use everywhere

477
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,640
this is a different type of a roving
book and by the way

478
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,890
there are guys in prison right now mob
guys that they did this to the Southern

479
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,760

484
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,160
you're on probation for a DWI in certain
places in California

485
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,400

766
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,800
in Second Life and what not and i own
you

767
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,130
now we're gonna talk about cameras
record

768
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,010
about 10 minutes behind schedule so I
gotta do this really fast

769
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:16,700
before I do cameras horror show your
cameras are capable of

770
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,630
there's a guy who covered the Obama
inauguration

771
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,200
and he home brewed something that he
called GigaPan

772
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,320
and it's not megapixels its gigapixel

773
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,550
its the equivalent was

774
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,910
1474 make a pic 14

775
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:39,370
174 megapixels or 1.4

776
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,120
you go pixels unbelievable

777
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,359
and here's what he did if you go to his
website GigaPan

778
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,930
you could scroll from there scroll and

779
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:55,040
scroll on and that's what you can get

780
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,320
it's good crazy look at that scroll to
that

781
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,680
now here's the whole Obama inauguration

782
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,560
from the crowd I was able to scroll into
these discrete faces

783
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,549
case you think I'm making this up let me
your case you think I'm making up when

784
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,550
you go home go to give a panda cub

785
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,790
do it yourself but let me show it to you
live so when I tell you

786
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:23,020
cameras are watching you you understand
what that means

787
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,590
way to we talk about it all works here's
what it means

788
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:31,010
carry look you can see not then scroll
at noon

789
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:35,870
is gonna take a second because I did on
a slow Merck

790
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,480
come on refresh

791
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,610
can see anything

792
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,630
the funny thing is I'll tell you this
the save time I tried to pick out to

793
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,390
release sinister

794
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:53,180
nefarious crooked looking guys as if I
was doing an investigation

795
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,650
and I scrolled in autumn you see two
guys

796
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:02,110
you see those pins there weren I showed
this I did this to a group a federal law

797
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,180
enforcement officers

798
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,310
and a buddy of mine in the audience

799
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:12,980
so steamy your own they are criminals
the members of congress

800
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,850
but I gotta tell you these a sinister
will look a little like scrolling auto

801
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:22,190
its adjusting I mean this piece good
more guys

802
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:26,180
but there but their members of Congress
I can tell who these guys are

803
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,590
I just for comparison look at that look
at that

804
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,600
that's what commercial

805
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,200
cameras can do now I do with the feds
can do

806
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,370
you to understand cameras everywhere
I've been using this since almost the

807
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,569
first %oh

808
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,900
1998 in New York around Bryant square

809
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,190
129 cameras a square mile annoying but
not terrible

810
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:54,730
2003 396 2008 1200

811
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,990
there are no 3900 cameras

812
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,080
in the square mile around Bryant Park

813
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,259
hogar really

814
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:12,260
crop okay I he's telling me first
blogger 10 minutes

815
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,370
let me show you if there isn't a camera

816
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,759
there's drones and I wanna show you two
trips now by the way this is a cyborg

817
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,390
the tarp is putting together to real
more of with the camera control

818
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,100
implanted

819
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,460
yeah honest to god but let me this is a
drone that can fly forever

820
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,780
school devil ray needs to recharge it
drops to

821
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,860
wires hits a high tension wires sucks up
the energy

822
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,460
takes off he's a real things this is a

823
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,940
are drone that can fit in a briefcase
you open it up

824
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,190
and it takes off arm

825
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:53,900
this is the NYPD they have cameras now
they can look into a car and see what's

826
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,680
going on

827
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,870
from two kilometers away which is far
enough that its oil

828
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:01,600
now let me show you disturbing video
number one

829
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,800
this is an here for micro air vehicles
or and navies

830
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,150
will play an important role in future
warfare

831
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:13,160
the urban battlefield calls for tools to
increase the warfighters

832
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,190
situational awareness the capacity to
engage rapidly

833
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,070
precisely and with minimal collateral
damage

834
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:25,910
and navies will be integrated into
future Air Force layered sensing systems

835
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,250
the system's maybe air-dropped forehand
launched

836
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:36,250
depending on the mission requirements

837
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,789
the small size if im a beast allows them
to be hidden in plain sight

838
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:50,430
once in place and naïve cannons were
low-powered extended surveillance mode

839
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:56,420
for missions lasting gains weeks this
may require the naïve to harvest energy

840
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,280
from environmental sources

841
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,240
such as some life or wind from man-made
sources

842
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,780
such as power lines and vibrating
machinery he will blend in with its

843
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,630
surroundings

844
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:13,539
and operate undetected you and maybe so
use micro sensors in microprocessor

845
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:14,510
technology

846
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:18,359
to navigate track targets through
complicated to rain

847
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:23,890
such as urban areas I'll in Navi
operating in urban terrain

848
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:28,020
laugh more chill the challenges than
larger you a beast

849
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,579
obstructions can cause wind gusts even
on a calm day

850
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:36,039
short fly one way to overcome this is to
learn from examples in nature

851
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:39,140
can use flapping wings to fly

852
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:44,328
sensing an oncoming gust feedback
control directs the weeks to flap

853
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:45,460
asymmetrically

854
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:51,180
compensating for the win small size an
agile flight will enable am a beast

855
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:55,500
to covertly N two locations feeling
sensible. by traditional means a burial

856
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,450
surveillance

857
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,829
and navies will use new forms navigation

858
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:03,190
such as a vision-based technique called
optic flow

859
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,869
this system remains robust when
traditional methods

860
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:13,869
such as GPS are unavailable argue with
you

861
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:17,890
times me show you the next video this is

862
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:22,609
commercially available stuff from MIT
watch what this quadrotor can do

863
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:26,630
do me a favor put the like this video
presents tens control capabilities for

864
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:27,770
Quality in Health

865
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:31,660
want to use 2010 I can system one more
time you for state estimation

866
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,710
him show single double in trouble

867
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,130
yes what you go through when

868
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,640
we developed a method for flying to any
position in space

869
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,509
any reasonable false you're pitching use
a method to fight the windows at various

870
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,900
angles

871
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,020
here there okay you get the idea

872
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,210
these approval in all over New York now
police cameras

873
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,310
I'm gonna zoom through I mean

874
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:02,590
so much stuff to cover so much what you
have to understand is

875
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,630
all of these cameras are mated with
facial recognition

876
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:11,040
on board analytics I know that there's
somebody who spoke earlier

877
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,880
and so that facial recognition can be
defeated it absolutely cannot

878
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,480
their outer others right now me give you
an example by the way about it works

879
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,690
the cameras job is to sell what you're
doing

880
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,670
are you walking up and down a
supermarket aisle looking for something

881
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:32,660
are you in a fight are you surveilling a
protected location

882
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,060
late issues the zipper schoolyards

883
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,099
I the problem with this is

884
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:44,330
the camera that the using for this
example is primarily used for monitoring

885
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:48,230
prison yards so if you look at Pier the
show

886
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:52,900
with little kids making a break for
search for

887
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:58,599
you know story playing a leading and
they're very upfront about Ohio State's

888
00:57:58,599 --> 00:57:59,460
earners

889
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,800
we care what you do facial recognition

890
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,369
thirty-seven states now do facial
recognition software

891
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:12,800
cross reference with the driver's
license database you're a wanted felon

892
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:17,720
the cross reference with the DL database
every single passport you apply for

893
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,880
now in the US subjected to facial
recognition it's good enough that when

894
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,300
University Kerala Colorado had a smokin

895
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,790
100 people smoking pot on the quad
ninety eight of the murder fart

896
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:36,690
from student ID photos and facial
recognition now

897
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:40,740
I don't believe this headline students
registered a large

898
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:45,070
at the new phase fit checkin I don't
they registered allied

899
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,660
but when you go to school it does if
you're playing hooky or not by checking

900
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,368
your face

901
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:54,490
real-world

902
00:58:54,490 --> 00:59:00,070
just for grins Massachusetts DMV when
they were

903
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:04,470
implementing facial recognition on their
on their driver's license photo

904
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:09,109
program they grabbed it from America's
Most Wanted some wanted photos

905
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:12,390
they ran against the Massachusetts DMV
database

906
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:18,270
to go to go this is becoming the way for
the future

907
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:21,580
II I love the two things that this
article

908
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,630
first evolved the guy says we are not
telling everybody in their driver's

909
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,540
license photos

910
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:31,560
neutral expression planes easiest to do
facial recognition

911
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,970
and the head of the DMV says DMV is not
a place where there's an expectation of

912
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:36,609
privacy

913
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:40,529
I'm incompetence either but differently
in our Privacy

914
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:45,740
facial recognition court fraudsters with
multiple drivers licenses

915
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,920
fed scored a fraudster in North Carolina

916
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,200
now real real real world

917
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,930
quick shower heads who knows what this
is from ok ok

918
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:59,849
for those view dole mossad decided to

919

facial recognition a lot these people to
be tracked from hotel to hotel

925
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,810
to hotel and match to passports

926
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:27,080
today there are far more this is the
person in the hotel

927
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,330

928
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:35,080

the men dressed in tennis outfits

929
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,540
getting into a Dubai hotel

930
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,400
left with Hamas commander Mahmoud Alma
who that's what police and intelligence

931
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,540
agencies are trying to figure out

932
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,109
a few hours after the CCTV footage was
filmed

933
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:52,839

01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:59,930
from Britain Ireland France and Germany
the possible to appear to be forgeries

936
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,990
several belonging to israelis with dual
nationality

937
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:06,440
that has fueled speculation that the
Israeli intelligence

938
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,010
the point is they were able to take just
hotel video

939

and other video and match it driver's
licenses

Kim can we do there's a there's a mic
year

1001
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:10,140
for civil Windows operating those lights
on reblogged

1002
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,410
could we didn't lose

1003
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,750
got worse of I had a question and a
comment

1004
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,100
the question is when we use Internet
Explorer it has the

1005
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:24,990
privacy side I went to explore how's
that helping then

1006
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:28,369
really mean art the second question is

1007
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:32,540
we're talking here about that Google's
bad Google can do this Google can do

1008
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,060
that

1009
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:36,839
this is like up talking about Starbucks
the back of the

1010
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:39,859
it's too expensive we can afford it and
then yet

1011
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:44,009
start taking the same Starbucks Coffee
owed it to work in the morning

1012
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:47,800
I mean okay yes I agree they're both
idiots what was your question but the

1013
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,230
question is that if we're talking so
much again school

1014
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:53,290
but yet we using Google's house to a bad
idea though

1015
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:56,680
we're using Google to get information
about almost everything that's on the

1016
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,880
Internet great yet let me let me just
say this very quickly because

1017
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,080
this is not a question i'm looking for
actual questions you're asking for an

1018
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,880
opinion

1019
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,690
let me tell you no never see you to
express opinions

1020
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:10,850
we're not telling you what to think
we're just telling you what to think

1021
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:11,868
about

1022
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:16,130
you need to be aware of this most people
are not aware of these various themes

1023
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:20,290
I apologize that we are cut cut short I
guess we have time for

1024
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,420
23 for more questions before this guy

1025
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,640
you know kills kills those arm

1026
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,970
I just want you to be aware you are
screwed

1027
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:33,980
privacy is dead and you decide what you
want to do about it

1028
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,080
next question please ask something about
a possible panel

1029
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:41,460
an investigative question or what not
I'll I'm familiar with

1030
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,869
appeared appear at the NCAA cases in
which I that

1031
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:48,319
a charge notes that defendant was
dropped because as IP address was

1032
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,240
insufficient information

1033
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,650
are to convict him of this crime arm as

1034
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:57,170
the years pass and additional
identifiers come up

1035
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:01,330
on in different cases are to what extent
do they hold up in court

1036
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:04,330
for example of opposed to making a
website where someone else could have a

1037
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:05,549
computer someone else

1038
01:07:05,549 --> 01:07:09,869
on could have your cell phone on are

1039
01:07:09,869 --> 01:07:14,490
as part of our criminal a I was just a
kid

1040
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,580
well as part of this are is a profile
and if you're in that house

1041
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,660
and like he said they'll check your
phone

1042
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,290
so if you look it up porno sites or were

1043
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:30,450
a child pornography sites and your phone
is at least 37 right next year

1044
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:33,810
lol again so it's mostly about cross
referencing well

1045
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:37,810
we've got prosecute somebody on one
single piece of data

1046
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:42,029
and the same where there's a dirty 30
meet sprays there's identity theft

1047
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:46,319
and there will be an can be arether even
with the cyber that a fire

1048
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:49,509
your cyber you can be can be stolen also

1049
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:53,359
nobody's gonna prosecute you based on
one of their far once that happens it

1050
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,230
will

1051
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:58,920
and this current administration for
ministration very much wants to do the

1052
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:04,060
you're just be extra screws Vespers
thank you for

1053
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,410
so we can stay out the database is what
about muddying the waters

1054
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,630
you know generating noise false for
falls

1055
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:15,290
extraneous data II don't know guys
already have you fooled by extraneous

1056
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,350
though no

1057
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:19,969
you try to do that but it's going to be
found out is a pattern they set up

1058
01:08:19,969 --> 01:08:23,429
know that likes to said you're not gonna
be prosecuted on

1059
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:27,190
on one piece of time bigoted profile you

1060
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:31,750
if the if there's a 6-foot-6 Africa
African American guy

1061
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:35,429
living in apartment and suddenly magical
in

1062
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:38,730
there's a 6-foot-6 african-american girl
living in that same apart with a new

1063
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:41,179

1064
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:44,279
has a good health for

1065
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:48,000
there's too many things cross-reference
and I can tell you

1066
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,259
when you come over to the table let me
run what's called the Corolla to

1067
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:52,779
research on you

1068
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:56,259
you'll see just by plugging in your info
we can for

1069
01:08:56,259 --> 01:09:00,469
hundreds of pages have open source stuff

1070
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,710
you settle on a resource that you can
use to look up things

1071
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:06,969
have you done anything to sorta
consolidate those and make it all

1072
01:09:06,969 --> 01:09:12,870
one fluid thing so we've

1073
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:16,170
yeutter Minister

1074
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:19,520
yachtsman affect I I use Steve Switzer

1075
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,759
his website is the combined sauce

1076
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:29,759
but I'm so time your

1077
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:37,200
that Hagel was the server are we have
something called a couple report which

1078
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,420
come to the table room or are you

and its Pittsburgh a multi hundred page
report

1082
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:51,980
Steve I just wanted something quick
criminal prosecutions don't exclusively

1083
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,000
come from this electron

1084
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,880
okay this electronic data in this
forensic

1085
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,929
is basically the icing on the cake

1086
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:04,780
the cake still has to beat bill the old
fashion way

1087
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:08,519
ok going out seeing things talking to
people

1088
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,710
doing the old-fashioned kind of
investigations

1089
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:15,760
okay the selected all the electronic
stuff that's the one of the ways

1090
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,140
phenomenal makes my job a lot easier but
to get a criminal prosecution

1091
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,730
exclusively on this

1092
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:27,550
is very difficult almost impossible okay
guys one more question I was told this

1093
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,300
is the last question

1094
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,580
the truth is I've really taken advantage
to the next speaker so

1095
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:36,239
