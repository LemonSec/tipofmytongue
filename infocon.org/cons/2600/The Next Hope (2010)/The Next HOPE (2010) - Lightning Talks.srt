1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,720
five-minute presentations to me Q&A if
you have questions for the presenters

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,898
please go ahead in line up at the mike

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,690
during their presentation because it's
going to be rapid on

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,889
and actually if you have a presentation
that you want to give during this

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,449
Lightning Round session

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,289
email project at work done that with
what you want to talk about

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,460
am going to try and add two or three at
the end so

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,710
if you have a presentation when I give
in five minutes email project

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,660
up Donna and on with some information
about who you are

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,000
so we can call you on subdued

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,360
yeah I'm I'm nd imprisoning you

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,570
later on to start I'm going to ask who
love you are sending

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,020
GBG encrypt the mouse if you and to our

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,270
of you are sending it to multiple
persons

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,340
some and you got some problems waif and

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,949
membership management of teas and all
the keys in so long

17
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,070
so it can kinda get crappy

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,710
to right cheap which encrypts en masse
to multiple persons like

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,290
some kind of male inmates so that's why
we started

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,290
tra LOI there and week

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,600
for

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,820
okay

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,230
yet so trader

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,910
me is just German word for slingshot

25
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,039
and it's that cheap Gucci enabled
mailing list software so it has a

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,940
private key

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,470
and you're right an email to that place
waif

28
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,530
that private key encrypt it and it sends

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,580
I'm there you mess it distributes tend
to all

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,830
the members waif encrypt with their keys

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,000
it's written in Ruby license on the
cheap bill

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,110
version to and it probably got some
chunky bacon in it

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,369
maybe you find it so it's completely MK
acknowledge ticket

34
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,580
we know that it works with postfix

35
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,460
on Q mando XM I am

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,660
its stripes of headers of to sender so

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,430
you have kind of site on a mid-day among
subscribers

38
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,660
you don't see it from where they have
actually sent the email

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,290
I'm it's acceptable for a plugins you
can write your own plugins to do some

40
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,900
stuff when you send an email to it so
for example

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,600
we also say that it's with your email
capability

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,450
so you can send on the matter to the
list and

43
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,980
containing the special keyword in saying
sent that email also

44
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,869
out to someone else not on the list
which then

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,720
makes the list usable as a shared
contact address

46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,480
waif at cheap cheeky I'm

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,929
it works so far reliable we I'm have

48
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,239
someplace waif a couple of hundred user
saddam

49
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,360
the recent feature was recently tested
with

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,370
over free 100 outgoing Mayor so

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,420
on it should work good I'm

52
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,680
the administration works over email

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,190
and you're sending I'm a

54
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,300
encrypt and signed email to the list
with special commands

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,610
which then administrate still is and
trader wary Feiss

56
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,989
or out in the Chi out indicates you by

57
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,080
their email signature and it's also

58
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,500
but totally optionally and miss you can
administrate by a little web interface

59
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,730
which is separate

60
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,380
from the list and that's totally
optional to use

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,670
so beware I'm you have to trust the
server

62
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,520
there are certain drawbacks and the
design we did on

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,010
because various private key for the
least

64
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,410
it has to be somewhere on the server and

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,640
it has two trip the mass so

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,840
you have to trust that server on

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,990
we're not sure how it really scares with
very large lists

68
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,720
them we're we're like to hear from
people

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,020
how big terrorists are and how it works

70
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,729
on there are probably some features
missing we got the a bug tracker and the

71
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:30,260
feature tracker there are some

72
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,300
in we are still working on some features
but

73
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,110
if you see other things just fire a
feature request

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,960
there are probably also some box left
you never know

75
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,159
we also like people to look

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,060
at our coats to look at try later and
tell us what they think about it

77
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,050
year so you find

78
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,099
earth wiki at related to for to turn on
the air got

79
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,650
or work there is a contact address to me

80
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,120
at to contact for on double up for
switches

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,610
also were tried at least itself so for
example

82
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,030
if you send an email to shrouded to

83
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,310
bash send key at now the year got or it
will reply you

84
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,320
waif the public key off the list and

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,340
then you can start communicating I'm

86
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,780
in in an encrypted fashion with us

87
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,110
so and that's the fingerprint and yet we
ate like two year

88
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,169
your story some feedback questions

89
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:41,080
I'm around

90
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,469
its for the next day so if you have
questions

91
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:51,470
just I'm compact this is David worker

92
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:05,030
and he's talking about the historic
project CofE

93
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,230
if you build it or camp last year CFP
this year

94
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,150
already think glad reading from July 1st
if you guys know it's in classes

95
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,540
you doing out there hackerspace earners
owner exist anyway

96
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,300
on you've already seen this X at this is
gonna be a lot shorter

97
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,360
so just a heads up on that

98
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,030
for okay so basically the idea behind
this is

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,150
web search history of this case it's a
idea that's been talked about for a long

100
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,160
time

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,300
the idea instead of China like hide your
searches are put them out there with a

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,870
bunch of other crap to make it harder
for a person to discern

103
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,770
which created by human being and which
were created by machine

104
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,010
so and wanted to be issued issues behind
this is that

105
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,919
II into it will the spirit think so
desperate is in 2005 the doja traded

106
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,010
have on certain information related web
search search history coughed over from

107
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,340
Google

108
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,729
they fought back but the thing is a
minor always

109
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,810
so it's just something to keep in mind
we have a company that is sitting on

110
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,060
what is

111
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,729
quickly becoming light for personal
information issue mankind

112
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,210
it's something that we might want to
keep in mind

113
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,010
okay so in this case we do a lot of
searches within your searches

114
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,080
for you do a Google search Q hay set for
Dec search

115
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,639
and it'll add a bunch of other searches
to the neck so that when you look at

116
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,870
your search history

117
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,729
it looks like you want to go into places
aidid's the algorithm

118
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:34,039
is fairly simple right and he basically
takes

119
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,389
a random mix between 0 to 20 other terms
that it would make sense

120
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,800
with your search term and then
randomized order that since Google

121
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,620
the sources with very limited right now
it's actually Google hot trends which is

122
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,880
not ideal because same company that owns
search engine

123
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,300
mom different research or anyway so

124
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,190
that's the first part of that the other
party is the part where using agrees not

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,960
to use a ship comes in if you're
familiar with the grease monkey

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,639
a add-on for Firefox or the heavily
heavily crippled

127
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,370
user scripts supporting offering chrome
and then you know what I'm talking about

128
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,490
in this case there is a very special
function

129
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,669
that lets you grab concept from another
demand and it's you

130
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:19,310
somewhere else in this case is running
within the browser so it's not

131
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,810
technically

132
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,880
there's no domains in that context
exploits theoretically

133
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,409
with this on maybe so in this case in
this is going crabbing Google search

134
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,310
results page

135
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,669
for a candidate for the fake terms

136
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,520
and then it reorganizing the redirect
URL that Google builds to keep track of

137
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,760
what you clicked on it

138
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,000
in addition to a bunch of stuff that you
fake searched you also have a lot of

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,979
stuff to be fake but

140
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,470
added into the next within a randomized
number with the bicep 125 also with the

141
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,829
possibility of getting

142
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,980
you know 02 whatever total

143
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,120
result you got on your search page would
be so that's that next step

144
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,589
a in this case is all client side code

145
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,050
so you'll notice a sec road and go to
work

146
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,160
has a lot of dodi now actually has only
got HTM pages

147
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,120
there's no doubt PHP there's no RHT no
it's not a rails app

148
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,850
basically when it comes to server-side
code there are a lot of companies

149
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,550
and the search services out there they
have the promise the same will

150
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,430
were the most private search engine out
there you should use us instead

151
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,790
as well as proxies the thing is that
they're

152
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,209
with that UN's held a certain amount a
trust so that it's only doing exactly

153
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,209
what its promising to

154
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,130
on something anywhere recently was that
the European Union has something called

155
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,189
privy seal which has simply go in an
audit make sure that seeing what it soon

156
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,839
and that sort of thing but that still
until the certain amount of trust in

157
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,850
this case is totally unnecessary

158
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,740
because this is all client side
javascript running within a greasemonkey

159
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,630
context we could be crazy ex's

160
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,020
stuff so and that's the other thing it's

161
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,630
incomplete so we want developers

162
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,230
and by we I mean be so this is why some
are the only person working on this

163
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,279
on we have open source code available on
get have the course it would have to be

164
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,200
open source I mean

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,360
were the whole point is you have to
trust anything

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,190
so it's Fars GPL licensed its which is
actually really easy then for man

167
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,910
because its clients a coach with Rd
their

168
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,990
for and you should focus on get help

169
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,970
when you get the chance if you have any
questions I have 1 minute 35 seconds

170
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,260
left

171
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,459
a sec product or the city actual search
page

172
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:36,690
so you wanna try this out go ahead you
guys wanna play around the code

173
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,120
some give

174
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,950
any questions

175
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,410
when you're talking about how the I'm
searchin a police station worked earlier

176
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,850
you make it sound like on your end it
also looks like

177
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,870
on your results are gonna be up for
skated

178
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,339
is there any way to prevent this because
that would

179
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,330
drastically decreases ability in so the
air where a man was

180
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,380
and there's a lot of terms are you
certain that you see between a lot of

181
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,480
different things in this case when I
mean by adding terms your search term I

182
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,800
mean

183
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,370
I guess I could say search phrases your
search phrases the headlight one search

184
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,480
for

185
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,770
you know puppies and then you have like
a bunch of other searches the other

186
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,689
searches run behind the scenes

187
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,870
and only yours opens up in its own
father but does it just like a single

188
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,540
regularly

189
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,010
right on this that I mean if you want
good so you found something

190
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,720
had to close your window and want to go
back and look at what you searched for:

191
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,019
you know I'm gonna see what you search
for and a whole bunch of us a you

192
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,860
didn't search for is there any way to
make it so you can see

193
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,769
only way search for that way you can

194
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,830
look at what you've searched for I'm a
history now

195
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,459
what's displaying in the search 00 if
you wanna like go back and look at your

196
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,230
search history

197
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,950
your Obama yeah I mean it's gonna be a
mess basically say it's

198
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,649
you can kind of go backs ands if you
remember what you search for find it

199
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:07,649
if not then it's going to be a big mess
it's going to be hard to be there

200
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:12,089
I hey secretary or a sec project icon

201
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,600
or actually if you wanna go directly to
wear to the actual web search

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,160
application on the page itself you have
to install greasemonkey on Firefox to

203
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,480
get it to run

204
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,519
on you can just go away haste dot AC

205
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,060
so it's Htay s she died AC

206
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,110
the Spanish Orton's we

207
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,760
any other questions thank you

208
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,420
go ok

209
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,709
time next up is Michael Redd Netsky and

210
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:49,709
he's gonna talk about interesting
application for postal trucks

211
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:56,730
for

212
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,129
hi up put yourself back about five
hundred years you live in a village in

213
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:19,939
Europe

214
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:24,238
no television no newspapers nothin hey
give

215
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:28,220
on well there are these guys that went
from town to town every

216
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,569
weaker to the clock cycle was every two
weeks or so and and they brought mail

217
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:32,369
but no one could

218
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:35,999
known to write a lot people could write
back then and if you were gonna send a

219
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,709
letter the recipient paid it was some
astronomical amount of money

220
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,889
equipment to ten dollars twenty dollars
now probably send the letter maybe more

221
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:42,720
maybe a hundred dollars

222
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,589
so very few people actually sent letters
but they carry these letters around what

223
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,899
happened when the guy came to the county
has worn off one was a simple the postal

224
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:50,600
service and

225
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,549
he brought a lot a news from what was
going on all around people pump them for

226
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:57,299
they brought in to dinner they said
what's going on out there and they told

227
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:58,119
me he collected

228
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:01,970
intelligence and brought it was a side
and communication system so

229
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,860
this takes it turns it on its head says
here you have the postal fleet they go

230
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,399
almost everywhere almost every day ago
almost everywhere

231
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,100
all around the country all around the
world almost every day why can't we just

232
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,269
pick up information using opposed to
flee

233
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,309
mobile sensors can sweep to an area pick
up

234
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:20,829
data like equipment to a much much
larger number of

235
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:25,459
fix answers you can have overlapping
find great coverage because they're

236
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:26,899
going so many different places

237
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,429
you can link useful measurements the
precise locations like some speakers

238
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,350
have described earlier this morning or
the

239
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,230
than vendors are talking about using GPS
tools both the fleet's fall the patterns

240
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,790
of human activity they go where the
people are they go with the businesses

241
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,160
are

242
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,209
they you can extract value from the

243
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,019
aspects a postal delivery routes
everybody knows

244
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,679
because you can get it on the internet
for free the postal carrier routes

245
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,119
that zip code data you know where the
trucks are going you can look that stuff

246
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,540
up this place is to find it

247
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,910
and businesses use that for demographic
purpose is to send out ads

248
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,179
so you can select places where you wanna

249
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:07,220
get data from if you want to get data
for example

250
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,669
near certain types of factories that
produce certain kinda chemicals in your

251
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:14,040
freight those chemicals are gonna get
down to the environment you can't pick

252
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,459
the postal routes that are near those
places and collect that data

253
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,989
so there's a whole bunch of applications
all gone through something that you

254
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:24,529
could use you could use it for chemical
biological radiological sensing

255
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,129
let's say you want to have the Olympics
in Atlanta you put some postal trucks

256
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,699
out there you could sense for those
things

257
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,740
you can monitor industrial facilities in
various places

258
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,199
you can detect chemical emissions you
can monitor air quality

259
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,689
create air quality maps you can find a
baseline so you can find out if

260
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,259
anything's

261
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,799
straying from their baseline and us you
can determine if there is a mess

262
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,410
if there's a problem in in a plant you
can measure all sorts of interesting

263
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,230
stuff

264
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,579
remember you're measuring the time the
place

265
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,720
you're creating a map you are creating

266
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,049
a topographic structure in more than
three dimensions

267
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:04,369
you can find out where these poor
broadcasting reception

268
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:07,459
you can find out where there's week

269
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,470
Wireless for cellphone coverage you can
map it

270
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,499
identify it figure out which cell towers
are are failing work going to fail same

271
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:21,470
you can improve this the quality the
signal you can correct

272
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,110
you can collect a razor fine grain
weather data to help predict whether

273
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,610
better

274
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,459
I mean by that is you can collect
humidity and temperature and so on all

275
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,419
the same time

276
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,720
see you can do mathematical analysis to
correlate them figure out what's really

277
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,949
going on with whether

278
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:39,309
you can sense road conditions and
pothole mapping

279
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:42,339
you can either use accelerometers you
could use laser sensing

280
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:46,689
its ultrasonics whatever but you can
figure out which roads are the worst

281
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,439
which ones need to be fixed now

282
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:51,899
and just because I think my road is
worse doesn't mean that

283
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,910
there's other roads that should be fixed
for such a qualitative method of mapping

284
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,230
out road quality and potholes and
finding them

285
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,999
you could say well the postal trucks
stay around them but they're not gonna

286
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,629
scare on every single day over six or
seven days

287
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:08,378
you collect the water for average data
networks you could detect natural gas

288
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:11,189
leaks and it turns out from doing some
research it turns out that there's

289
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:14,360
tons of natural gas leaks that are going
on because the system's

290
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,659
and the pipelines are very old there's
pipe there's gas pipelines they're made

291
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:18,250
of wood

292
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,619
a week like a sieve and a lot of places
and sometimes you can smell it sometimes

293
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,709
you can't but there's a ton to

294
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,549
now the collection one place that can
explode so this is a public safety

295
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:26,510
opportunity

296
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,169
you could scan for at this is a price
issue quickly

297
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:33,129
you could scan for license plates for
stolen vehicles and I'm not advocating

298
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:35,419
this I'm just saying its potential
possible

299
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,840
you could because methamphetamine drug
labs produce certain types of specific

300
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,830
chemicals you could easily identify
those

301
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,320
you could identify locations were
explosives are have been or are

302
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,240
or other takes a dangerous materials by
using very selective sensors first

303
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,879
particular chemicals

304
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:56,250
now you could collect Street View
imagery not just once like Google does

305
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,980
but

306
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,760
every day if you want to do but
obviously this huge privacy implications

307
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,679
you could record acoustic profiles to
map ambient sound levels and cities near

308
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,700
factories

309
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,870
you could figure out are these factories
really too noisy like people have been

310
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,289
complaining about

311
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,490
I you can use the spectrum analysis that
the sound to figure out if there's

312
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,559
things creating noise that our problems

313
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,830
a you can all see is ultracet you can
collect ultrasonic in for

314
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,869
in for sound data to not just horrible

315
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:29,250
okay out I'll skip somebody's butt
biological surveys you could disperse

316
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,230
insect hormones to tip provide pest
control you could sense radio

317
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,480
radioactive radioactive materials you
could nap electric fields and

318
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,809
and magnetic fields to help with
exposure in humans which is thought to

319
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:41,520
be dangerous

320
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,369
you could collect utility data so once
you build the baseline map

321
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:49,080
you can find out what's changing on a
very rapid basis and it can be a small

322
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,110
change

323
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,159
you can also put things on post office
cuz there 24/7

324
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,039
they're available so there's business
models that I will talk about but the

325
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,908
Postal Service Canada justly set
everything or they can't do some other

326
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,100
stuff themselves they probably aren't
very good at this stuff so they

327
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,980
shouldn't get involved

328
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,840
really and there's obviously some
societal and privacy implications which

329
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,629
I don't touch on here but I've written a
paper about it but I think that it's

330
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:11,750
very important

331
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,100
Google had a problem some public
relations problems recently with

332
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,059
collecting Street the data but they're
also collecting WiFi signals for very

333
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,190
good reasons obviously but they're
having problems

334
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,270
so there's some issues that one would
have to take into account

335
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,129
but basically in shorts to conclude at
any sensing that postal vehicles do

336
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:28,010
postal

337
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,940
Postal Service is very trusted it should
be consistent with the trust the role

338
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,289
the postal service in our society

339
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:38,320
thank you

340
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,039
are there any questions com

341
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,610
so correct me if I'm wrong about this
but I seen that the postal truck itself

342
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,860
each truck doesn't go very far like you
know each town has

343
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,809
you know a couple trucks I would go
through the town so if you're putting

344
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:54,580
all those

345
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,470
expensive equipment into a truck but
it's only staying within the town how

346
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,629
would you get this

347
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,840
widespread you know gather information
that's a good question first while the

348
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,369
average

349
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,418
route proposed truck is about 12 or 14
miles right the pretty short

350
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,539
roots and on the rule that's the city
routes are the Urban Roots

351
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,330
the role router about forty miles and
they got the seventy miles even but

352
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,139
the router short there's a lot of postal
trucks they deployed during the day they

353
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:18,460
go out but think about this

354
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,590
it's a moving cloud particles and even
though they're not on the same place

355
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,779
they're all over the place they're all
over the place and at during that entire

356
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,220
period time

357
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,279
and up these are not expensive I don't
think that you need a lot of expensive

358
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,629
gear some other gear that people some
vendors at them

359
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:37,629
showing off his is a good party that you
could have a blackberry with the sensor

360
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,240
attached to it you probably have most of
what you need

361
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,980
so I think that the cost it the cost
about getting a vehicle could be

362
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,750
something as simple as a piece a bill
crow on the side with the BlackBerry

363
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,139
attached to a couple other

364
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,149
aborts so that's that's what I'm
thinking that it would be very expensive

365
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,840
but you could also do it

366
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,049
I'm with only a few with these things
and then just move them around every

367
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,580
week you move it to a different location

368
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,049
any more questions okay

369
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:09,700
thank next up is

370
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,090
next up is on Josh Davidson he's going
to talk about the idea of

371
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,720
desktop on computers

372
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,520
yet desktop it's really good idea I
think instead using command-line

373
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,279
interfaces wish that this

374
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,350
no actually I his roommate talk about is

375
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,789
desktop metaphor with which is the the
current

376
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,990
a graphical protocol basically for

377
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,419
interacting with computers the current
stare paradigm

378
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,369
are I believe that it is a detriment to
the advancement of technology

379
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,539
the desk continuing to use the best cut
metaphor

380
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,570
so explain why it's bad and I'll tell
you why

381
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,189
we could make something that's better so
first of all

382
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,830
a some background on the desktop
metaphor was created originally forty

383
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,849
years ago

384
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:59,389
1970 that was a really long time ago the
pedos

385
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:02,710
broke up that year Nixon was president
at the time

386
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,840
I see rocks created it as a lot you
probably know

387
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,399
Apple popularized it Microsoft
monopolized it

388
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:12,649
arm and was meant to be a metaphor call

389
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:16,020
electronic desktop to ease the
transition

390
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,539
for businessmen from the rigid in
mahogany desks

391
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:23,149
over to and equally rich 8 computer

392
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:27,669
interface and electronic desk I am

393
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,250
so basically a desk opposite 2d it's
flat

394
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,070
I that desktop is a route everything
that exists on the computer

395
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,240
everything goes on top of that so just
like a real

396
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,639
desk now it keeps computing locked

397
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:46,039
and an arcane static business-oriented
state

398
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,929
today's fast-paced on the go in the
pocket

399
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,059
socialized information based computing
no longer

400
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,299
fits with this paradigm and so a

401
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,190
continued use up this desktop interface

402
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,950
is basically keeping us backed in this
business

403
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,929
focused around where it doesn't really
seem like on the surface like it's that

404
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,250
big a deal like will

405
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,849
you know I can browse the web I can do
everything that I want to do through

406
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,210
this desktop interface

407
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,879
doesn't matter if it's based on this
board in nineteen seventies idea that

408
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:17,960
Xerox came up with

409
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,539
will it actually is restricting the
potential

410
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,260
capabilities that you could have with
eight different sort have

411
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,389
human-computer interface whereas
nowadays

412
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:31,490
how it could be better computers are

413
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,720
as you guys probably know more than
anybody computers can be used to make

414
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,879
are and beauty instead of just being
like a business machine and office

415
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:39,559
machine

416
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,168
and users don't understand that we
understand that

417
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:47,450
but in order for other people to be able
to understand that be able to access

418
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,470
the cloud and the hyper creativity and
the infinite knowledge

419
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,609
use computers as a megaphone arm to
humanity instead of just using them as

420
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,030
these

421
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,178
office tools there has to be a change in
their interface because that's all they

422
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:02,010
see

423
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,530
and so on now's the time to create a
more consistent

424
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,530
general organic life top that takes
advantage

425
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,299
have them its power the Internet
integrates it with the Internet

426
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:16,649
so I have a few ideas

427
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,260
I am got my family you

428
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,809
okay %uh this give you at a quick
example

429
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,039
up an alternative to like it desktop
based computer interface

430
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,320
arm something I was thinking about was
like a cell-based

431
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,629
interface so everything is based on a
cell so of your individual files and

432
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:40,139
applications are just cells and cells
can interact with each other

433
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:44,250
and you can see their interactions on
the screen now instead of being just 2d

434
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,359
and being able to move up down left and
right

435
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,449
you can also see 'em in and out see be
able to see him out and

436
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,220
I love your applications and files would
shrink down into a single cell

437
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,750
and you would now see your entire social
network up individual cells

438
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,119
you could see the social network
interactions so you can see a friend's

439
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,470
interacting with friends

440
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,659
you can see your friend post a comment
on somebody else's status update

441
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,090
you can see waves have interactivity
flying after this network

442
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,399
to connect graphically visualize is like
a social network

443
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:16,030
and you can continue to zoom out further
and further or sue Mann further and

444
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,609
further

445
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:20,668
so kinda fractal like so that's just one
example you guys probably can come up

446
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,250
with a million better ideas

447
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,690
but my main point is that the desktop
metaphor is dead

448
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,710
and we need a bandit and stop developing
for it

449
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:35,710
thank you you have any questions

450
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:44,090
yeah but couple actually yes when you're
talking about

451
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,490
yeah I being a 2d environment but the

452
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,679
physical interfaces we have r2d

453
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,099
you can't easily have a mouse go

454
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:58,439
up at the same time since going left and
right

455
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,250
basically I'm not saying I that we're
actually going to have like you know is

456
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,149
some sort of holographic

457
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:08,690
interface or or actually have a
literally 3d interface

458
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,119
I'm just saying rather than having a
desk

459
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:16,320
based interface whereas I play something
on the desk and I can move it up and

460
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,740
down and left and right

461
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,549
a you also will have this third
dimension we consume

462
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:24,639
out and but that's not that's just what
my

463
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,639
one idea on you can come up with

464
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:32,669
even better to be interface it's better
than the desktop metaphor I believe

465
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,500
my other question is what you're talking
about seems mainly to be just about how

466
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:36,990
you

467
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,169
store files and programs

468
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:43,539
and your integrating it with some social
networking it doesn't seem like you

469
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:44,369
would actually

470
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,580
streams how we compute when change the
programs themselves

471
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,990
while me when over a very brief

472
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,629
explanation have my idea which basically
there's a lot of like

473
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:59,750
I cave in at there's not even going to
it but that's just

474
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,970
it's just might be like I could talk to
you more about that

475
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,359
afterwards actually if you'd like to but
that's just my idea

476
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,619
my main point it's just that the desktop
metaphor I feel is hindering

477
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,599
the development of computers and
people's ability to interact with

478
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,389
computers

479
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:18,460
so anything that takes more advantage

480
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,669
you know the power the Internet
integrates better with that

481
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:25,070
is going to be better than continue uses
arcane desk up

482
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,399
interface would like to talk to you
about that later

483
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,049
I definitely any more questions

484
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,099
okay dont thats the end to the lighting
rounds we didn't get any live

485
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:37,349
submissions

486
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:40,950
if you would like to do a lightning talk
tomorrow after the keynote

487
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,090
email projects up dotnet with lightning
in the subject line and your phone

488
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,750
number somewhere in the body

489
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,349
up the email so we can get in touch with
you that's it thank you
