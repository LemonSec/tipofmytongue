reposition ourselves

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,570
in time and space various ways to locate
ourselves a week earlier in the day

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,740
reposition ourselves in two different
places different times

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,050
different as you find out even different

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,180
people anyway so

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,190
on would like to do is first introduce
the members that you know them had a

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,550
time

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,829
here on the far what is your left

12
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,010
is running for stand

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,360
here we have no a circum- and would you
like to introduce ourselves as well from

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,089
check time and the moment

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,690
I my cutlass ok

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,980
said okay so my

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,159
particular section you're in if three
sections a sensually

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,290
which is said I'm gonna talk a little
bit about hacking the p5 virtual-reality

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:09,990
close

20
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,130
on the we're gonna have folks on the
side talking a little bit about work

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,600
that they don't run a talk about

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,540
ahh kid a project that he did know we'll
talk about

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:26,200
are augmented reality and vendors these
folks here gonna talk about

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,400
%uh several different projects that
they've done so on

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,270
there's a lot of information to cover
and also I'm gonna be senator on a piece

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,089
of paper

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,210
are in a few minutes when I get on with
my section

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,049
center on a piece of paper if you're
gonna be here throughout

29
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:45,930
are the next like 24 hours arm

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,960
I was able to bring with me on the plane
but my friends are driving up

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,970
I'm actually gonna be giving away AP
five virtual-reality glove

32
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,039
are so put your name on the piece of
paper

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,009
and cervical circulate around to your
name and the Mexican put on the glove

34
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,320
and just go like this

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,320
and the name that lands on you one
yourself for p5 virtual-reality glove

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,620
if you can't state that's okay I'll send
it out to so

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,800
ok let's start out with a

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,650
little bit about who I am on menus can
and I am the founder sensory research

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,390
and its organization engineers designers

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,569
Island artists musicians who dedicated
to providing useful tools

41
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,190
for human augmentation human
augmentation courses

42
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,970
home improving what our senses

43
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,780
already do improving the ways week get
information

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,730
are the ways in which we work with tools
hands

45
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,819
it's been a passion of mine for many
many years

46
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:50,080
I am a developer of interactive software
for mobile devices

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,480
on as well as for human interface
devices

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,869
all different kinds on everything from
the glove to

49
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,030
even doing stuff with vapid modem
hacking the Apple Remote

50
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,900
arm and on muscle performance artist

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,390
and I'll be talking about that towards
the end love fun my little section here

52
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,370
and muscles to the readership called
interactive technologies which is going

53
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,090
on for

54
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,140
most fifteen years now talking about
technology

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,519
missus we interact with that means it
helps human augmentation

56
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,970
and serve when I hope you can get onto
the server what you gain on if this

57
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,129
is on some general concepts about
sensors

58
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,329
and how they work our data mapping
thinking about how to take data from

59
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,510
sensors

60
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,099
and Matt other feats that you want to do
other tasks

61
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,519
arm and also think about motion the
human body

62
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,780
and so coding at the bit level 100

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,030
deal with multi mold minute

64
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,049
code and some

65
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,420
new levels of creativity and utility

66
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,280
new ways of expressing ourselves as
musicians artists

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,150
developers are performers I love

68
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,879
even just interacting in our society and
some

69
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,959
also community and that's going to come
out in this

70
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,149
I think the reference talk and I should
point out starting this

71
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,488
that if it wasn't for the community I
love

72
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,940
2600 net that road runs

73
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,960
and so also people

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,440
County on and various other

75
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,800
securities explorers in hackers I
wouldn't have been nearly motivated

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,020
to do the things that I do all these
people inspire me

77
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,039
clinical to the inspire you so

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,080
about 2 p-5 plus 2 p-5 glove was a
virtual reality love

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,758
and it was released by social reality

80
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,960
incorporated in 2002 since the glove
right here

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,359
and this is the receiver ends

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,389
a it was designed by for yes

83
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,419
like I did John Finkler cuz nitric
limited are

84
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,698
development company in jewish mark to
market for the glove

85
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,150
was scheming and this is members is
really to the city's

86
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,470
for the Viva for all that stuff and
chemicals were always very expensive

87
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,970
than other types of

88
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,740
must use a coupon %uh scenes were very
are expensive

89
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,169
and not really in the reach love are
your average game

90
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,210
into came bundled with a couple games
Tiger hunt and

91
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,659
it ma'am and its I

92
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,270
and it was %uh I'll

93
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,359
initially really really popular first
super excited because there is going to

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,259
be a cheap

95
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,020
of virtual reality close available that
didn't last too long

96
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,000
are due to lack of games there was only
like three games to three games that

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,330
came bundled to hunt him and another one

98
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,940
%uh the people to gain but no new games
came out

99
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,539
%uh they utilized it so dude like games
to you to the lack of soul

100
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,780
sole developer documentation for STK was
not so hot

101
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,979
on it was originally written for Windows
Anders love

102
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,169
mix people and Mac people and at this
point

103
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,630
it was a bit for the Mac folks it was
only developed in the STK only covered

104
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,710
Mac OS 9 at that point many questions
are ready

105
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,489
in full force arm so do you do really
well

106
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,530
then they'll select and promotion and
make focus just on games and I think

107
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,560
that was a big mistake if there's room

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,289
so such a reality was sold was actually
reverse acquisition

109
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,020
I love the guy who ran the company ended
up

110
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,669
merging with this hire a company but he
took over strange thing

111
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,750
on the change the focus since was in
2000 %uh

112
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,419
and so for actually sorry that's a
stupid sexy 2004

113
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,508
became Alliance distributors game
distributors arm

114
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,860
here on the East Coast other clubs went
into limbo and served as much property

115
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,699
evidence

116
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,449
sure was gonna happen with that %uh
stocks is the glove

117
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,669
were sold off two different companies to
distribute and sell

118
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,210
and no one was really sure what was
going to happen many attempts were made

119
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,389
by the user community

120
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,729
art get information out of the people
who had worked on the glove development

121
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,150
people would work for such a reality
even was trying to

122
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,530
to tap into the glove in your lies
because it seem like a really big waste

123
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,400
and some Italian did to the same moment
but

124
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,039
it was eventually embraced love by a
community of people that they never

125
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,090
intended and

126
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,870
to get much farther so the technical
specs let me give you just

127
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,990
a sense how this works so

128
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,139
other are FiveFingers I'll

129
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,539
measurements like independent figure
measurements

130
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,310
bend great great here from 0 to 90
degrees

131
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,990
and there's also optical tracking with
this

132
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,910
here and so you have it like this

133
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,069
and you have the glove on hands

134
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,389
you're moving in front of it like this

135
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,090
for your XY and z. for folks that maybe
aren't into animation

136
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,169
your you are anything like that so X

137
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,719
if you remember any future monetary
things X

138
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,720
why and see friend

139
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,020
depth and suck the

140
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,370
up to tracking also did pitch are y'all

141
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,949
in me which show of course are

142
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,250
this this and we

143
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,760
was like this that that

144
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,260
like that and that was factually
extrapolated from

145
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,849
XY and z. solicit really unnecessarily

146
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,660
read directly on that had about one
degree of accuracy

147
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,420
own XYZ is as I note here was about half
an inch

148
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,420
pictures and her three trigger buttons
on the clothes

149
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,180
HP and see there is also a power bottom

150
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,890
and other gloves up the buttons on the
glove could be mapped to anything

151
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,260
and the refresh rate is about 60 Hertz

152
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,269
so it's pretty fast for

153
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:18,910
getting data to the user from the glove

154
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,779
and data XYZ location ordinance are plus
or minus eight hundred

155
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,390
and the fingerprint sensors have values
0 to 63

156
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,990
rents nice 63

157
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,100
and the buttons data would be zero

158
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,490
for of one for on and it was USD 1.3

159
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,550
have the time that it came out I'll with
a type B male connector which is

160
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,790
your typical USB male connector you'd
plug into

161
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,170
a laptop computer for example update
itself

162
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,300
coming out love glows

163
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,100
I need your computer is the city binary
code

164
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,709
dis witches nipple is basically so

165
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:05,870
very minute data packed together to try
to it

166
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,790
get as much information in a small space

167
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,469
Andrews accessible via standard USB
libraries

168
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,269
and bit manipulation you can do in like
CC spice

169
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:20,730
Java and many other languages that can
do

170
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,779
you wise operations and 92 tackles and
grief

171
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,189
if it seems so this will be the most
technical operator

172
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,410
ominous the actual formidable if you
look you can see

173
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,969
these are you a false ants

174
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,579
that's like one reading up the glove
that's one deter reading the globe there

175
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:41,690
you can see that

176
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,339
packed 6-bit bend sensor data index
middle ring

177
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,339
pinky from up button data

178
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,149
AB and C IR sensor report index

179
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,250
stew what the sensors are theirs sensors
are all

180
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,540
back inside their and the packs thirty
bit

181
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,560
info 4 %uh XY and z.

182
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,450
imus massaging today to this is
something that I wanted to talk about

183
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,029
on as we get into this because a lot of
folks you the work with sensors

184
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:21,149
a new that some any time you prefer
sensors really do need to massage the

185
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:21,920
data

186
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,800
need to clean it up a little bit because
they are perfect thing sensors are very

187
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,579
imperfect the kid

188
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,140
case you very simply can be very complex
but regardless there's always

189
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,410
will be cleaning up with the day do you
do we called data smoothing

190
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,339
right so were you the sensors is going
to require some data smoothing

191
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,660
up the sensors provide very data because

192
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,810
not all the sensors may be receiving it
I'm so

193
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,060
you here your hands may be off a little
bit

194
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,350
im one or two from may not be picking up
any data

195
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,950
seeded figure out how to you get rid of
that

196
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,209
in the next issue you get the roadies
values just

197
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,810
you know you'll have four values for the
censors all say the same thing but then

198
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,750
you get a value from another one

199
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,850
that's like 0 or something that's
totally erroneous to you

200
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,269
to get the most useful data %uh karate
studies have to be removed

201
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,399
and remaining values have to be averaged
you

202
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,200
take the total is your sensors and say
okay a particular type sensor

203
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,260
on you say okay what's that average
evolve these nuts

204
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,540
good way to clean up the data kinda
quickly

205
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,769
I want a little bit about the
communities we talked about how the

206
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,170
closer went into limbo

207
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,579
people didn't really know what was going
to happen we wanted to get her hands on

208
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:37,880
%uh condition target market was given
however the p5 became really popular

209
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,250
with artists and musicians

210
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,560
ok eventually built a huge community
around it for a while

211
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,380
arm ends the committee was able to move
forward to some important contributions

212
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,600
wanna know from developers performers

213
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,820
on some folks who arm are in Australia

214
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,950
over to some amazing work that's she's
mcmullen Ross

215
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,100
been seen and to Cracker on the released
some

216
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,279
the first third-party stuff after the
gloves had been serving given up by a

217
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,550
central reality

218
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,060
the release third party software that
actually showed how you could decode the

219
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,790
data format coming out

220
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,810
and showed how you could use it in music
and video manipulation

221
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,519
can't really cool thing that they did

222
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,570
that I think just push to set it so much

223
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,620
was the introduced the use love

224
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,870
open sound control now open sound
control

225
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,310
was a protocol developed here in the
United States %uh

226
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,300
seaman %uh came up with its its protocol

227
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,769
thats open the spec is open ends for
audio video controller information over

228
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:47,709
network

229
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,370
so essentially you have information from
a control

230
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,110
from a control device and you'd like to
get that to your audio or video

231
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,410
for see our software or whatever so
there's this open sound control protocol

232
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,709
which shows its gonna specification that
shows you

233
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:07,839
how to delete your information and send
it over a network

234
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,790
and then the receiving application take
set apart

235
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,209
purses /a gets the relevant information
and then

236
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:18,449
uses it to control whatever you want

237
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:22,110
armpits usually %uh implementable

238
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,740
I'll implant implementable specification
and

239
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,029
it's now a popular in many audio video
applications

240
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,370
arm

241
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,660
basically supercollider and so

242
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,680
reason and so Maximus

243
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,180
p and any any the applications that you
will serve

244
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,000
audio/video manipulation all handle open
sound control protocol

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,810
and you see format is relatively simple
you have an address

246
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,480
pattern which is basically where you
want what took place

247
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,510
what place you like to drink the
information to once received by the

248
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,290
receiver over the network

249
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,899
I'll and then you have argument type tax
basically stream

250
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,730
love arm

251
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,940
single letters that just say this isn't
that I'm sending an integer

252
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,829
August strings and I'm sending are or
this is a plot which sees any type of

253
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:22,459
data

254
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,350
were slow to which is like 1.5 for two
floating point numbers

255
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,389
love you just said again simple
recursive pattern similar to file

256
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:30,910
directory structure

257
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,290
slash whatever slash whatever slash
whatever

258
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,810
are bases architecture Street inflow
love Sosa

259
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,610
and serve the arguments will match that
format so whatever

260
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,259
however many take taxes you have that's
me arguments here actually providing

261
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,500
an example I have here for the p5 love
is you have the address had p5 love

262
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,329
and then you have a comma and then
you'll have v

263
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,160
address answer the argument types

264
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,170
and in this case it's all integers
coming from the clothes and then you

265
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,509
have

266
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:05,660
values like 63 for the fingers

267
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,920
800 on for the XY and Z and then

268
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,019
for the button 0 or one

269
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,160
and some I

270
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,459
embrace this is since I found up loves
being released %uh

271
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,870
lives bought a bunch from got really
really excited

272
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,180
and then when the social reality went on
a business trip

273
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,910
change their business arm to put the
gloves off

274
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,399
for sale in quantity some my business
actually

275
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,399
bought like a whole boatload of rum and
several other companies did a company in

276
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,839
in

277
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,920
can to save the world are in a few other

278
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,519
distribution companies botched tons as
the gloves

279
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,980
and so we've been providing them to the
community arm

280
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,630
and so allowed us to keep it going
otherwise they would be sitting in a

281
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,899
warehouse

282
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:01,350
so I stimulus for use it for music and
video stuff

283
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,709
are a transom performances in

284
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,579
2004 ion in 2005

285
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,149
called sequential progression I'll 1.0
and 1.1 respectively

286
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,589
in the utilize the glove for audio video
and virtual reality control

287
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,319
arm I do was called QuickTime

288
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,168
panoramic virtual-reality photography
QuickTime VR

289
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,070
which is i take pictures in a circle or
in a sphere

290
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,490
several angles around and I stitch all
those together

291
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,950
and it creates a virtual reality movies
you can navigate through in these are

292
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,720
often used in

293
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,309
real estate Obama and and other
companies

294
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,520
or businesses or individuals who want to
give you an immersive

295
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,299
effective navigating through some

296
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:53,429
right aren't so what I desire it some
softer that allowed the glove to control

297
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:57,250
navigation through these QuickTime
virtual-reality things and also

298
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,160
sound mapping it's a simple sounds is
was talking about in terms

299
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,650
map so the idea that as you used the
glove

300
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,510
you're gonna map the data that's coming
from the glove into

301
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,559
functionality for controlling sound and
video

302
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,289
so it's obvious things arm the first

303
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:19,730
was pitch and that seemed to me

304
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,610
%uh to map %uh quite directly to

305
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,929
v y-axis rights so

306
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,809
pitch copper down as a move my hand up

307
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,620
which goes up so move my hand down to
pitch goes down

308
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,940
%uh it seems to me that X map to very
well to phase right

309
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,770
phases where the wave years crests and
troughs

310
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,730
in your samples sound information any
information

311
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,679
that matter anyway information %uh so
this change

312
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,080
the phase I love the sound a.m. in
volume and see me

313
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,949
closer louder further away why

314
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,230
louder why so I to that really simple
mapping

315
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:09,250
arm and then did some modifications for
the your own stuff like that

316
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,110
on just switch with the sounds and
samples and it works really well

317
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,160
and it was again an example love

318
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,660
you can take information from sensors
you can think about ways

319
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,620
in which you can there's sort of a
template for

320
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,840
other activities other things that you
want to do

321
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,580
um ends really experimenter do some
amazing things and really your minds

322
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,039
is the limit on this slash treated to
performances are actually

323
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,370
Wow preparing for the performs as I
started reading software

324
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,760
for the desktop as well and they came
out with

325
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,179
up what's called for conduit desktop
application

326
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:52,650
anfal conduit com work courts

327
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,919
these manipulations %uh your reaction
reports the glove data

328
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,760
right hours your ex lines easier bans
all that stuff

329
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,010
and allows you to play it back and then
send it using the open some control

330
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,100
protocol

331
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,030
ought to manipulate things or actually
fewer virtual-reality movie

332
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,960
or control sounds great in the
application itself

333
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,020
export that to other formats:

334
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,250
on so that you can send files to people
and stuff like that

335
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,890
ends I'll I'll talk a little bit more
about software that I've done

336
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,250
arm looking at you a quick demonstration

337
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,679
if the application

338
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,669
and this just shows you the interfaces
someone spend too much time on it

339
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,809
because you know she's chance to see it
in a live performance if your gonna be

340
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,520
rounds

341
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,530
week so this is actually are just two
examples

342
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,110
the interface is the application Scott
window for viewing your virtual reality

343
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,370
or your movie you can control your
movies as well scratchy forward

344
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,570
if it's an audio look if you want to do
a quick time richest audio

345
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,750
you can scratch forward scratch back and
stuff like that

346
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,070
or fast-forward reverse whatnot

347
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,939
on play so it's like a typical tracked
application again

348
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,940
tracks you can create you get a viewing
window and then on the side

349
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,250
on I created some windows so that you
could see

350
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,450
what you were manipulating an awesome
connect camera

351
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,900
to your computer and see with the camera
was picking up

352
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,890
the reason I did this is because I'm
really into rehabilitation

353
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,809
arm software in in working with trying
to

354
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,600
on improve people who have

355
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,080
been accidents or have arm

356
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,110
rebut claims and other things that are
basically they have to train themselves

357
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,340
again

358
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,030
are two to use this thing will research
has shown

359
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,289
that if you see yourself moving the whim

360
00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:00,240
you actually train yourself faster and
become more accustomed

361
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,789
to the change or if you're being
rehabilitated using

362
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,190
you know your your damaged women in
rehabilitating

363
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,350
you improve the rate at which that
happens if you see yourself

364
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,559
doing it and that fascinated me so is it
okay wanna

365
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,030
let people see themselves from the side
and also see

366
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,490
what they're so they can see what
they're navigating and you can see from

367
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,110
the side

368
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,799
how they're navigating and I thought
that was really use

369
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,379
song arm go back

370
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,070
to presentation ok let me show you are a
quick

371
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,428
video-harp love gets put on here since
just

372
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,100
using the glove

373
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,470
when we computer-controlled we discuss
that and

374
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,100
fingerprint sensors control buttons
internists

375
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,340
that goes around your hands slide

376
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,809
to look for put your hand in the

377
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,230
finger stirrups like this

378
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,690
and before you put in farm on your
absence me

379
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,740
from around turns their

380
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,880
and put your thumb on and states not in
the scalding XO skelton

381
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,809
solely to mir love arm virtual reality
or augmented reality controllers that

382
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:19,940
are actual skelton

383
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,340
it means that it goes over your hand
it's not

384
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,559
not like a fake and that you're
controlling actually is a

385
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,710
as a shell that goes over what you're
doing

386
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,870
arm and the yeah you can basically

387
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,650
as a surprise to her son and

388
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,580
sweet tooth a min and you're ready to go
sit with your body

389
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,889
couple feet away too few ways good you
go up to four feet away

390
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,730
and still get so a good results

391
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,690
in terms of receiving so

392
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,510
presentation

393
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,039
arm the bigger picture really wanna
wanna leave you with in terms of this

394
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:07,850
project

395
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,210
is that arm censor programming in open
protocols

396
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,630
allow for diverse applications
navigating things that you want show

397
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,510
like I said

398
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,000
real estate medical are things like that
education

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,120
are having students navigate if you
can't go to the Parthenon

400
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,380
why not make a QuickTime VR or are

401
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,809
so the new like x3d which is the new VR
protocol

402
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,840
are for the web that's going to be on
top hopefully

403
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,990
ratified with html5 arm X treaties

404
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,049
really great standard and so with things
like that you can actually

405
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,940
very easily create schools better
immersive and that allow you can

406
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,400
navigate and whatnot again for
rehabilitation for

407
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,440
video music animation VR and lastly the
thing that the

408
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,779
originally intended for the glove arm
gaming

409
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,279
you know and I'm actually not much
became more and more into the Aaron GR

410
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,400
stuff but

411
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,700
on that's also there's well

412
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,360
and we wanted to do is because it's so
simple

413
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,720
and because it's something that I want
to motivate people to do

414
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,130
arm I've been working for the past few
months on a little project and I'm happy

415
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,289
to announce here at hope right now

416
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,590
I've released something it's available
on the web site scope for conduit

417
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,370
OSCE it's a Coco framework so it's it's
for

418
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,929
Mac developers who wanna rights offer
the you lies is the open

419
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:34,980
arm sound protocol it allows you to just

420
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,289
easily and data

421
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,990
to a dictionary basically and just say
send

422
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,440
and then your data can go out over the
Internet to any

423
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,520
application that can receive the open
sound protocol

424
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,340
begins coca framework very easy to use
Seville one sensor research website now

425
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,140
there's no charge for it I just want you
to do something amazing

426
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,730
are many games are so many applications
that utilize the protocol

427
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,679
your you're not limited in once you
understand how send

428
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,419
you can think about receiving in person
that protocol and as you saw it's very

429
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,220
very easy in their specifications online

430
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,140
also very very simple stuff and lastly
and 12

431
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,700
let you know that aunt 2 a.m. tomorrow
night

432
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,000
so Sunday morning 2 a.m. after the chip
tune concert

433
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,870
my band is going to be performing the
band that did the sequential percussion

434
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,039
stuff a couple years ago

435
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,980
we're actually gonna be performing are
in the few temple

436
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,470
Obama and its a full band imbue
corporate the glove for controlling

437
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,789
audio/video

438
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:45,360
in manipulation and I also generated
QuickTime VR panoramas

439
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,279
for this event I also did some 3d
animations

440
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,000
and smother really cool things that I
can be projected and you actually see me

441
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,090
controlling

442
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,350
the sound and video incorporating that
with all the other stuff that we do

443
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,630
so I encourage you to come and check us
out I know too late

444
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,700
thing it's 2am there's lot of things you
could be doing at that time

445
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,799
break your to you will not be
disappointed we put on

446
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,129
and awesome show so come check us out
and I like to thank you

447
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,740
you can find out more again at WWW dot
sensor research done at

448
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,760
you can email me at info at sensor
research done

449
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,340
in to rate now would like to do is turn
things over to Ryan

450
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,390
and have him talk a little bit about the
projects the Keystone

451
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:34,760
any particular one that I think really
stands out in terms of

452
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,379
being creative with interactivity and in
this case

453
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,950
some hot stuff so run

454
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:50,950
on

455
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,490
samack an outhouse gonna just

456
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,809
thank cool and

457
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,350
both these microphones workers I

458
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,490
my name's Ryan ahora I'll some love you
might

459
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,630
know me matters that fucking douchebag
army

460
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,710
1 um I do a lot as

461
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,090
DIY stuff work with the maker people

462
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,419
hang out with in my series has two kids
shows one

463
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,090
but in particular %uh I was involves

464
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,640
with Nick magazine floor while

465
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,220
an article published magazine

466
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,850
make blogging look and one of the
editors at PC Magazine sign

467
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,659
and said he you live in New York now she
do story for us

468
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,600
basically what the challenge was given
to me is that they want me to create

469
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,260
a mobile office car

470
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,520
is parked I created this system called
the hyde kid

471
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,760
which never really materialized as a kid
so for sale treated

472
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,289
to reassure the retail market but
anomalous was fun for me

473
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:10,029
hopefully people utility from

474
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:15,279
project a.m. I'm also involved in da
makin my see

475
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,399
one of the organizers also help out with
tink

476
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,200
with their more you can find out more
about all those projects you

477
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,779
these web sites %uh the idea behind hide
shit

478
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:30,740
was should shake sh information from
this mobile office

479
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,649
and pulled up in front driver in the
virtual environment that is

480
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:38,110
be me on the windshield

481
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,000
love problems come up from the car pc
that you want to be

482
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,320
where all the informational time Winfrey
males to comment

483
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,970
looking for information about projects
for whatever

484
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,750
train information about car and things
like that after PC provided all this

485
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,039
information through

486
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,010
standard per PC email client

487
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:04,960
diagnostic connection to the car she can
get speed

488
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,669
interesting facts about is currently
going on car I'll be just look at the

489
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:10,110
screen to do that

490
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,120
in be distracted from job driving

491
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,340
arm sOooo I decided to do something fun
and I put a heads up display in his car

492
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,090
um what basically this project was

493
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,860
a VFD vacuum fluorescent display put
into a little

494
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,230
metal box it puts a VM your visor

495
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,299
a.m. inside the school device I

496
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,279
vis-a-vis ft exits high-intensity gives
could contrast

497
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,260
a front surface mere as

498
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,000
low-light loss distortion any a classic
magnifier lens

499
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,120
from Fresno

500
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,980
street it's like triangle where

501
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,620
the images reflected in projected onto

502
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,779
sure to a piece of glass and from the
driver

503
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:05,690
will be the smokes film but some
contrasts

504
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,149
between the image the actual world
outside view

505
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:12,630
then in your field of vision you have
the series is

506
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,640
information scrolling by use new duties

507
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,200
emails speed things like

508
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,840
looked a little bit like this was all
done

509
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,220
covered see it took this image of the PC
magazine website

510
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,029
lost all the original images from
project Paul gestures crudeness

511
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,200
other EC reach you the ultimate mobile
office

512
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,269
which was the title this project great
because PC Magazine gave me an unlimited

513
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:42,419
budget

514
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:45,860
bed because only months to do it

515
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,669
ended up being put together with a glue
gun and looks something like this:

516
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:54,269
its initial stages arm

517
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:57,519
I feel this project is important because

518
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,299
in order to really virtual reality
augmented reality

519
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:06,029
and sensory input from humans arm

520
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,490
individual development is really
critical DIY community is really

521
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,419
critical

522
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,659
on as you can see the commercial failure
this device

523
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:16,970
it was picked up by the hour community
improved in a few

524
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,740
really the only efficient entry into the
commercial market for these two

525
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,730
technologies is through

526
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,130
individual India way to go

527
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,760
this is a really good example of how you
can get involved

528
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,190
what is now the trailing edge augmented
reality technology

529
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,710
arm the automotive hide first appeared
in cars and leave in the 1980s

530
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,799
some American cars header statistics
about

531
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,789
your speed and things like that
projected onto the windscreen

532
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:51,029
I do not use the windscreen for this
project because unfortunately

533
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:54,840
you have to put the VFD dash little
street

534
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,899
treats from as you put someone on the
VAT for a long time system

535
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:02,909
crap actually but

536
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:06,669
you would think so but these things
didn't disappear overtime

537
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:10,450
there's actually a 2001 Pontiac up on
you can as

538
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,640
these heads-up displays in cars up until

539
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,799
now actually there's a Buick

540
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,860
has 1 2010 viewed as a heads up display
which

541
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,980
I from these devices really fun and I
wish they were in all cars I don't

542
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,000
understand what

543
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,100
what is preventing them from being there
may be people find them annoying and

544
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,570
distracting

545
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,350
stupid but I like to be able to see
what's going on in my car without

546
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,190
looking down

547
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,330
radio station mp3 what have you

548
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,870
i'd I wish have one now even though I
don't have a car so if you're

549
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,870
New York City

550
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,390
this application augmented reality
bringing

551
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,450
data that is in the pre free into your

552
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,860
into critical world the world you see
front view

553
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,019
really I wish I had a pair of those
glasses

554
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,140
do that for me but also to clinch a
mission from my cell phone

555
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,520
not have it be obtrusive arm

556
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,409
that's about it for this project I do
have another sensor project that I

557
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:12,450
currently have

558
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:15,020
I don't know if you seen above the
pinball machine in the air and space on

559
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,489
the mezzanine floor that you can play
with his

560
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,929
home i'm for you guys you know break-in
really sorry

561
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,639
I spent I spent a couple years working
on this project really like

562
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,089
to preserve it for Maker Faire in
September of a debt

563
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:31,520
concedes shooter now it's a pinball
machine and course

564
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,810
miss you sure you just pull out and the
ball speed really depends on how fast

565
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,589
enough for report shooter

566
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,219
really really good way to church to
determine that is to get the measurement

567
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,839
distance and really inflection practical
applications

568
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:49,129
I can find was too to use a bend sensor

569
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,899
which when desman censors banned the
recesses

570
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:56,879
resistivity increases you measure
resistivity honored we know

571
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,920
and you can tell offers meant and I'm

572
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,619
as and mentioned

573
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,790
for cotton pants real name are

574
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,790
should be I only

575
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,820
I only know him from myerson anyway I'll

576
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,240
see you choose you take his data I which
is really crude are you getting values

577
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,910
1 to 10 I'm sorry one to one thousand
has to the voltage measurement units

578
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,529
massage

579
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,300
down to you trekked for hairs and

580
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,540
for basically him LC

581
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,849
the we knew you worked these type
sensors

582
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:38,740
humans movin kinda funny ways

583
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,790
each if you accept data readily few
trusted him

584
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,150
explicitly then obviously users going to
do something

585
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,650
expect one thing get another because not
doing exactly what you expect

586
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,270
but today it has to be in size and I cut
to size down 5% increments

587
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,730
so my pinball machine has five different
speeds at which the balky

588
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,910
shop device come take a look at the
machine

589
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,970
it's amazing level the Art Space Needle
corner the walkway

590
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,060
I'll be doing a talk on in on Sunday

591
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,930
1 p.m.

592
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:17,930
thank you very much %ah

if you

595
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,290
there's gonna be some pension arm so I'm
gonna take this piece

596
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,660
you your first so

597
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,049

to give this one week as it's been used

600
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,820
on my up and is actually bringing up the
box version of the glove that has

601
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,599
everything all packaged in hasn't been
opened everything like that

602
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,810
so Owen if your gonna be here tomorrow

if you're not gonna be here talk to me

604
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:08,430
after the session on wall range to get
the glove to use again says

605
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,828
to win a p5 glove put your name on here
I and at the end of the session in a

606
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:13,619
little bit

607
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,530
on

608
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,510
thanks okay and sumac

609
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,930
last addition

610
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:33,930
not corrode user

611
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,099
so my name as they say it is Noah's Ark
and

612
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:44,150
I'm its where to start constructed
reality

613
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,880
been following a rx its

614
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,010
I guess about since I was 14 and took a
field trip

615
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,210
during summer camp to the MIT Media Lab
man

616
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,710
still man and dance kerner pioneers in
wearable computers

617
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,940
and day

618
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,320
referred to it is augmented reality and

619
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,950
tyson's sir start following the field

620
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,520
I'm sorry for pract talk harm

621
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,359
but I'm any I am

622
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,690
AR has become a buzzword in the past two
years

623
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,420
marketing circles online general

624
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,700
and people have started associating it

625
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,930
largely with the printed fiducial
markers held up in front of a webcam

626
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,410
with a superimposed 3d

627
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,700
imagery and makes cockpit and its

628
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,040
really soared misuse of the term

629
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,410
arm AR Tumi

630
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,859
really denotes up

631
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:54,310
the visual over confusion and virtual
and real

632
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,529
encompasses comtex truman pervasive
computing

633
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,589
location-based computer in and

634
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:05,680
my AR

635
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,990
VR project actually came our

636
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,030
a frustration with devices

637
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,930
like the p5 to power I'm the

638
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,169
see the cyber of

639
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,540
which is the research targeted

640
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,790
acted the glove targeted towards the
research market

641
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,829
that includes our think up to

642
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:34,329
20 sensors to flex answers for finger

643
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:37,630
than abduction sensors between

644
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,810
the fingers its fingers spread

645
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,049
risks sensors

646
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,470
30 so and it's incredibly expensive to
track it in space

647
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,160
you either need it to use traditions

648
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,180
motion capture like by current system

649
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,500
app to track which is infrared tracking
system

650
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:04,819
or and I or inertial sensors

651
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,009
and enthusiasm for inertial sensors is
actually

652
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,420
got me started buildings desert

653
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,720
devices on let's see so examples of an
inner

654
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,450
inertial motion tracking system would be
for instance the accents

655
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,869
move in am

656
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:26,069
can't really see hands by

657
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:29,220
and I am you which is an inertial
measurement unit which generally

658
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,839
includes

659
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:35,480
3-axis accelerometer 3-axis magnetometer
3-axis tracker

660
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,980
will basically give you

661
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,319
Europe six degree of freedom

662
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:46,810
information about a given position or at
least orientation

663
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,078
so it doesn't do because as they were
saying the sensors aren't

664
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,180
ideal it's difficult to do dead
reckoning

665
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,520
tracking through space several

666
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,690
even better than massage in the data to
something called me extended Kalman

667
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,930
filter

668
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,618
covariance falter that

669
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:14,119
it basically gives you a reliable
results for orientation so that's

670
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,540
rotation about the X 10 access

671
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,630
either enjoy your angle circa turn Ian's
your

672
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,880
a full rotation matrix I'm and

673
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,210
it basically orientation so you get a
act or compensated

674
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,180
heading using till payday from Nixle
amor

675
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,399
am and and the heading

676
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,069
component from the magnetometer
explicitly compass

677
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:46,160
and and using the Giro

678
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,160
you can basically get smoother

679
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,410
I'm for mission magnetometers career
updated

680
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,848
at a very high rate most systems I'm I
can

681
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:59,690
sure you guys a video the work system I
bill

682
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,050
and really impetus for this project I'm

683
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,089
was there for Anna

684
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:10,578
love interfaced defiant as part of an
augmented reality system it has to be

685
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:12,130
location independent

686
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,240
and most the even remotely affordable

687
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,460
the are interfaced prices was based ices
and

688
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,540
requiring extra reference for tracking

689
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,880
space for instance this

690
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,869
hum ok I basically camp

691
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:32,890
system using element

692
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:37,670
potentiometer initially to access to a
renowned 3-axis gyro

693
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:41,800
I'm some are mounted I'm and

694
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,740
tracks a success parameter and
eventually magnetometer

695
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,369
talk compensation I'm for

696
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:53,339
tracking it least relative to the body
arm position

697
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:56,950
took a pimple 15 fuck sensors multiplex

698
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,440
red banner transmitted wirelessly

699
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,849
using the XP justice works York I'm

700
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:07,220
and Road here deal

701
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,050
VR environment processing music love to

702
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,140
interface with you can have the
processing environment

703
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,089
output policy since

704
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:22,109
$42,500 to open frameworks

705
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:25,170
which is another open 3d

706
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,300
interactive development environment but

707
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:33,619
yeah xvideos Cundiff tacky a friend of
mine

708
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:37,380
wanted to commercialize this so he ended

709
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,349
together for me

710
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:45,270
the name was his

711
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,200
and objected it's the second glove

712
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,579
so potentially surging if

713
00:43:54,579 --> 00:44:01,579
happens my site

714
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:07,420
its hasn't come all that far from this
actually presented

715
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,440
this pack year and a half ago

716
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,440
now to come materials were asked me to

717
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,480
presented

718
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,410
fat man in circa function come

719
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,540
thousand fair bit of fun

720
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,020
be out no idea

721
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,910
flame great no one just

722
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,009
okay take no responsibility for the
attack

723
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,359
gifford and it says it was done in one
day

724
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:46,619
basically one over here discuss place
until one for himself he could go around

725
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,700
to and

726
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,829
was actually over the course of two days
but total time

727
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:59,130
under 10x

728
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,599
still and stuff

729
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:09,000
here

730
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,770
imagine Rage Against the Machine

731
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:17,770
yes have you guys seen world builder

732
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,910
it's aired 3 short sorted

733
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:33,730
true

734
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:40,730
so reference lists

735
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,210
on

736
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,140
them

737
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,049
nm it was music done

738
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,749
days

739
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:08,010
african Barrick assessments

740
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,930
peace

741
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:14,120
sounds good

742
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:21,120
since

743
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,200
ash

744
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,200
anywhere to go from time

745
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:49,010
by the way would say that probably the
definitive near

746
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,040
here

747
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,029
is sound scared

00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:28,350
AR displayed that I've used Canon 100

790
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,779
its be got smaller

791
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:37,130
stereoscopic I'm and southern down

792
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,310
the air University of Southern straight
year

793
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,529
which has a 3

794
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,930
wearable computing and the magic

795
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:53,690
vision christians and/or anyway and rid
of

796
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:58,290
also I have want that to happen updated
much recently by

797
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:03,460
and early entries basically expressed my
view is pretty accurately

798
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,619
ok an hour I'm and

799
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:10,119

pad well invading

804
00:50:56,729 --> 00:51:00,599
yes

805
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,109
smooth transition significantly

806
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:13,109
Smith transition okay is working after
something totally different

807
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:19,150
am

808
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:23,329
talk is coming okay

809
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:26,849
Mike area I'm Lemm and

810
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:29,939
Micah card hi

811
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:34,618
so we're from from San Diego

812
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:39,890
we hear teach UCSD work with the bank
this

813
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,489
fucking ok tax

814
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:48,449
thank you very much okay good so this
isn't what %ah crisis culture and

815
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:49,640
emergency aesthetics

816
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:54,140
in the bank long-serving talk about two
projects

817
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,359
really that look at these issues and
then one

818
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,959
bring to 320 earlier project few
inspirations

819
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:04,150
and yeah

820
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,909
stupid so

821
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:13,029
I am the the camera vision for talk is
for us to be thinking about these

822
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,640
these questions crisis culture and
really a like how do we as

823
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,158
artists and hackers and activist

824
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,549
artifice week ourselves I how do we
respond to crisis

825
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:28,779
like a economic crisis ecological crisis

826
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:33,289
humanitarian crisis eased all these
cases were faced on a daily basis

827
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:36,659
faced with missus and how to respond

828
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:40,799
and part of what what we wanna

829
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:43,869
be thinking about is idea

830
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:48,059
strategy world-building dat part of the

831
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:51,059
the rhetoric of crisis like financial
crisis is

832
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:57,519
is just way for systems have power to be
able to push to change that they want

833
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:00,859
I'm so instead we wanna say that in
crisis

834
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:04,339
wanna reimagines we could why don't we

835
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:07,449
imagine what the future is gonna be and
start building

836
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:14,449
future instead of just responding to
what other people so

837
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:18,529
just starting with some inspirations
were really inspired by

838
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,619
you really think ourselves as arms
containing

839
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:26,619
performance artist new media artist and
so we really inspired by this history a

840
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:28,659
performance art and I'm

841
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:32,890
part if we want to do is show some these
these to all the projects to say that

842
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:38,118
life didn't start with Arduino but that
people

843
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:41,400
have been thinking about things like
sensors

844
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,709
to and like reading relational objects
and imagining

845
00:53:44,709 --> 00:53:47,919
technologies for a long time so there's
an artist name to get a clock from

846
00:53:47,919 --> 00:53:48,799
Brazil

847
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:52,089
and as a politician sixties she was
making

848
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:56,890
relations objects at Marina Abramovic

849
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,868
way asked if peace rest energy which is
really

850
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:03,989
interesting for us at this project
you'll see

851
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:07,429
taking a sexual and well

852
00:54:07,429 --> 00:54:11,539
which we will explain and moment back
after and she said and

853
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:16,049
the they actually make turn heard be
found that we didn't know that at the

854
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:18,079
time that we were working on this
project

855
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,839
you'll see in just a moment safe

856
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:28,709
it's their their project using her be
but also thinking about inspirations

857
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:32,989
this is a good image I think because
diseases so many

858
00:54:32,989 --> 00:54:36,199
millions examples from pop culture this

859
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:41,369
intersection sacks and technology and
the fam and

860
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:44,999
and orders listings wrapped up with

861
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:51,239
that desire the future we want we want
and this is an

862
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:55,769
shot from Agere modem is penny is keep
in touch and a sad

863
00:54:55,769 --> 00:55:00,419
name use this think my and technology
which is kinda this idea that it doesn't

864
00:55:00,419 --> 00:55:01,388
really have to her

865
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:04,579
cash am which may be a lot of Technology

866
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:07,679
yeah so this is also

867
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,499
whenever inspirations flying I am

868
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:17,539
don't and this is just you know this is
in the bathroom

869
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:22,309
this hurt on we like to think about how
everyday objects are changing

870
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:25,979
with the sensors %eh this week your hand

871
00:55:25,979 --> 00:55:29,809
Server Monitor paper town how our
everyday lives are changing

872
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:34,929
sensors and and part of this was to say
that we really inspired by the

873
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:36,009
traditional feminist

874
00:55:36,009 --> 00:55:39,659
an alarm that traditional ways to save
that to

875
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:43,339
the things that we interact with on a
daily basis are perfectly good subject

876
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:43,889
for art

877
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:49,509
and sound today when the things been
active on a daily basis there are

878
00:55:49,509 --> 00:55:51,869
sensors they like medical information
buttons

879
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:56,669
their things with your hands from
something happens steve is using the

880
00:55:56,669 --> 00:55:57,058
bench

881
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:00,589
president meant

882
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:03,949
its nearly 60 makes 5 few

883
00:56:03,949 --> 00:56:07,509
she wahoo

884
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:11,809
William good I am anybody heard of this
Michelle

885
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:14,819
I yeah

886
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:18,599
course defiant another inspiration lots
and lots of sci-fi

887
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:21,809
I am Angus initially have full
prosthetic parks rec

888
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:25,289
supported we want to think about is
Henry get

889
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:28,319
make that happen and

890
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,889
and also that's a good time to say that
word

891
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,880
thinking about these things critically
right how do we get to four percent

892
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,479
bodies

893
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:40,319
not assuming that it's gonna be good are
not assuming that using Second Life

894
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,069
or virtual sex or sever Saxony these
things arm and improving our lives

895
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:48,509
but just think about what are the
implications what happens when we have

896
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:49,239
four percent

897
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,519
box and

898
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,169
and is a picture of this conversation I
had with cellmark

899
00:56:57,169 --> 00:57:01,449
in a previous performance ended his
another artist on a body admonition

900
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:06,389
and his arms are inspired with because
we totally disagree with him he likes to

901
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,569
say things like the body is obsolete

902
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:12,419
am but I think it's pretty ridiculous
he's just being provocative

903
00:57:12,419 --> 00:57:16,618
but in particular in this talk he said
that avatars have no organs

904
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:19,669
and so act sounds like

905
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:23,959
crap to me I'm so business contact kind
of

906
00:57:23,959 --> 00:57:28,319
response by showing it's not true

907
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:34,130
so ok split this into so one thing is
we're trying out my new reality but here

908
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,809
on our side that a lot of our workers

909
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:39,089
mixed reality I'm subject sexual system
Roddick

910
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:43,269
mixed reality performance with biometric
sensors to create a live audio

911
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:48,329
to preach virtual physical space I'm
want to have been a mixed reality I mean

912
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:52,609
we'll highlight SMS really because it's
a broader term that augmented reality

913
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:56,150
and like you said I mean really such a
buzz word if you have a specific idea

914
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,329
that it's about

915
00:57:57,329 --> 00:58:00,789
translucent headset so it's about iPhone
app so whenever

916
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:04,839
but I like Nextel you kissed a broader
field just any combinations

917
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:08,828
realities and a similar our personal
experience I'm interested in doing work

918
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:10,349
about my personal life

919
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:15,489
and this idea mixing realities is
something like mixing genders

920
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:18,630
and sexualities and

921
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:24,859
mission Center so I'm interested in
those things

922
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:28,199
and so and this is used like a shot from

923
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:31,380
Second Life from performance xxoo

924
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:35,829
add like a lives hamar sacks in Second
Life

925
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:39,819
I think that it's so that's also say it
has some this project a concession was

926
00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:40,380
where

927
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,599
again performance real life in Second
Life at the same time right and think

928
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,429
about how we can use sensors

929
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:48,849
to extend and expand the traditional
performance art

930
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:52,759
where if it did prevent art is about
making art with the body

931
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:55,889
that has a question change antibodies I
commented

932
00:58:55,889 --> 00:58:59,150
distributed virtual digital these things

933
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:03,509
am and also working with pop culture and
the things that people easing some

934
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:07,359
party why were interested in Second Life
because there's 50 million users in

935
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:08,199
Second Life

936
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:13,449
so that means there's millions of people
right and 15 14 crafter 109 views is a

937
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,159
virtual worlds

938
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,239
means there's hundreds of people
interested n

939
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:20,449
okay maybe millions doesn't speak
interest and

940
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:23,609
having sex as a kak percent or

941
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:27,109
bear or and fox or bird or

942
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:30,239
dragging for cash cyber cafe

943
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,339
and some with me power there Bridgend
think about these emerging

944
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:38,630
forms environment how the more has begun
a body these things more

945
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:42,229
something bike Tran species are trans
real

946
00:59:42,229 --> 00:59:47,209
becomes lhasa like a fantastical day
more people surveyed area

947
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:50,219
also man and thinking it's kind of like
what you're saying

948
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:54,859
have Mikes as a reason coming from
musical backgrounds

949
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:58,239
as well I'm really thinking about the
body is an instrument

950
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,630
and so that's kind of where this came
from using biometrics

951
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:07,339
and so we created this analog verse and
the fertile parrot eggs

952
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:12,099
doctors government pizzazz answer to
contact Mike attached to it

953
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:16,239
and we actually recorded the sounder for
her teeth

954
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:20,559
and existed

955
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,049
use eminent to this which is

956
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:27,159
here digital heart rate monitor versions

957
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:32,489
uses this a mouse uses this pkg strap
around here to detect

958
01:00:32,489 --> 01:00:36,769
electricity in her P and then there's
this wireless transmitter

959
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:40,009
there and services and wireless receiver
transfer fun

960
01:00:40,009 --> 01:00:43,079
the bricks are concerned we know and

961
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:46,429
so then the reason to themselves to

962
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:51,779
so this Wesley reads the review it just
gets a number

963
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:56,630
but I'll see every and then we send back
data it's here

964
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,619
pure data PD xx

965
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:04,809
its to send maxims

966
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:09,179
great yes it's like open source version
which sleep she said

967
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:16,179
yeah Sonipat

968
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,930
that you just heard it sounds so much
better when it's actually live so

969
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:04,930
see this

970
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:06,650
okay

971
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:10,630
you known okay don't get here this pic

972
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:14,090
customer tempelsman place but I

973
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:18,310
to we have another fee schedule said but
it's a graphical programming language so

974
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:23,160
incentive doing assignments like
frequency

975
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,000
equals Moses parentheses something

976
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,140
you just remind right as a procedure
programmer took a while

977
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,819
to get giving how much just that

978
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:39,130
I should just said that some win this
session when the talk is done

979
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:42,900
ever audience participation I actually
have some max patches

980
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:47,100
the global be connected to so you can
actually see max in action play around

981
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:47,730
with the clothes

982
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:52,120
okay said let's get back to you

983
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:57,779
the science own

984
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,190
reason we have retrieved a question for
them

985
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:04,590
because Asher he said how do you get the
data into Second Life

986
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:10,080
yes turned to the PD to the Patrick

987
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:16,069
into second so in this case that were
only sending the sound a ten-second life

988
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:20,410
so basically reusing this program called
sound flower their routes out from one

989
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:21,839
application to another

990
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,890
on by in another application will show
you

991
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:29,740
and a few minutes we actually patch the
Second Life Klein

992
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,860
I limited data available so that we read

993
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,800
data from a local file so we can send
data from the sensors straight into

994
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,660
Second Life so we'll get to that amber
we get the data from the Arduino

995
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:45,420
over the comfort just there's a comfort
object in PD so it to get the heart rate

996
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,070
it average

997
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:51,690
and use of

998
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:55,620
hirsch ish am

999
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,980
so fire circus tent church sound I am

1000
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,510
for research if so even collaborating
and also

1001
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:06,860
real-life partners for few years now

1002
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:10,610
and services may be here four ish piece
that we've been together

1003
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:15,010
surveyor circuits and we started really
wanting to explore more

1004
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:18,310
and wearable electronics and so

1005
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:22,040
and creating soft sensors have so

1006
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,880
we've really got into death fair sec if
to the half

1007
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,940
okay sure and so

1008
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,970
so this girl getting this question how
do we respond to crises

1009
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,630
right like health crisis and so with
this project we really want to be

1010
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:37,420
thinking

1011
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:41,300
about how the rhetoric

1012
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,710
love virus hysteria is use control
populations

1013
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:48,960
are really have a medical system in
general controls people and how we can

1014
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,300
respond to their critically and imagine
something else

1015
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,400
soon this performance is really like a
speculative

1016
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,450
have sci-fi series of performances take
place in this

1017
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,560
alternative future where am

1018
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:06,230
viruses because I've proliferating vices
like h1n1

1019
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:11,080
am this is the CBC just like a standard
CDC cover your cough poster

1020
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,330
but if you notice in the corner here's
slight modification which is failure to

1021
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,250
comply may result in a minimum of 10
years

1022
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:22,110
in a federal penitentiary on sorting out
how that's really not so far off

1023
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:27,030
and also this you may be asked to put on
a surgical mask to protect others

1024
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:31,250
San other big part in them performance
am and we didn't protecting that's

1025
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,910
that's just the CDC past

1026
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:36,330
I'm sure people are seen as for sir all
over the place

1027
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:40,060
yes at work at school somewhere

1028
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:44,320
this is an

1029
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,370
micas ultrasonic rangefinder

1030
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:52,730
drama okay so we really want to improve
on their previous performances in

1031
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:53,500
different ways

1032
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,020
I'm one was to make everything wearable
and Wireless

1033
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:01,180
just make everything better and more
portable

1034
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:05,120
I'm so this is just a standard

1035
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:08,520
rangefinder sensor France work fine I am

1036
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,150
has three different interfaces

1037
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:16,720
analog positive modulation and cereal in
this whole conversation that massage in

1038
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,609
the date is really relevant to us cuz
the rangefinder although it's

1039
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:23,710
you can be really reliable ikno its it's
generally very noisy

1040
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,740
you so we tested all three interfaces
and

1041
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:29,880
pretty much in all three even a it's
supposed to be better for sale

1042
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,130
its it's not if you're willing
management here should say the great

1043
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:38,109
value like 777 and be like 777 107 772
777

1044
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:42,839
and so will say something echoed for
reading mister am

1045
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:48,000
after I am says you're using like that
the lily Carter denounces the sample

1046
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,240
now the wearable electronics fun than

1047
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,689
am p.m. Cherie from MIT

1048
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:58,450
yeah am and sound it's really funny now

1049
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:01,649
the convective thrash and conductive
fabric

1050
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:06,009
and we got really answered I I am and

1051
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:09,330
when of leased XP say

1052
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:13,670
and so are you can see here i mean a lot
102 in a part of what makes it works and

1053
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:14,569
has these

1054
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:19,240
flap hats to make the connection so that
a threat can lay across the Pats

1055
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,370
and and X

1056
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:26,299
a lot of challenges religious leering at
laying out the wiring and finding all

1057
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:28,069
the shorts that might come about

1058
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:31,470
I mean okay so we had some shots am

1059
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:35,830
because like basically break were red
with a range finder is

1060
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:38,609
all these three wires have to come
together in a really tight space because

1061
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:40,240
it's just a regular circuit

1062
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:44,309
and sell conductive thread is on
shielded it has to be

1063
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:48,410
and basically just make sure separate
you can use puffy paint to

1064
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,559
massive

1065
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,910
says close after electronics and that
protect just

1066
01:09:54,910 --> 01:10:01,130
using this little bit if fabric to find
places to put a hex

1067
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,670
0 another problem was that XT is an
incredible battery hi

1068
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,980
took us a while to realize that when you
have better sex offenders for

1069
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:12,800
XP and for the are doing a i mean
clearly the XP can

1070
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,320
will kill the battery and Mike an hour
and

1071
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,139
and then it just it doesn't stop working
it just starts weeding out

1072
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:24,510
it starts legalized gambling game and me
now we know that like when the lights

1073
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:24,760
are

1074
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:28,330
free in a certain way just have to
change the batteries tester

1075
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:31,640
voltage and then we realize there's
something calmly power

1076
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,220
which of better for an answer would have
been nice to know that

1077
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:41,580
beforehand spent noise figure she said
as you go

1078
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:45,150
also hears them a pressure sensor we
created with

1079
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:48,700
an conductive fabric conductive thread

1080
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:53,110
and ukraine and little piece of our
staff which is what time electronic

1081
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,650
components come in

1082
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,230
and we found this on Instructables and
its

1083
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:01,800
super easy ends chief

1084
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,530
well yeah repeat sixty dollars for a
whole roll of fabric you see them in a

1085
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:06,940
bit

1086
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,130
fear anymore I am

1087
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:13,520
chief had a conductive fabric singer
yeah it's really

1088
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,290
agree sensor really easy to make some

1089
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:21,310
if you're interested in pressure sensors
their hand recommends

1090
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:25,910
making this app and its revival tammy
has a really wide range right so the

1091
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:28,389
pressure sensor start responding when
you just touch it

1092
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,860
but if you squeeze it responds more and
then you squeeze really hard to tell you

1093
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,170
still continue to change

1094
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,370
and set up pressure sensor was part my
collar

1095
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:41,269
and so it was actually a choking sensor
sound as my Kenwood

1096
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:44,710
checks me Anna the sounds it would send

1097
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:49,540
the data to PB and it would create like
a distortion on the sounds

1098
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:53,380
ass here's my course anything
pre-selling just

1099
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:58,100
their protect every message about how
sex shop sir

1100
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:03,080
my card stores cuz with using doing a
record we always have stuff that fix

1101
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,370
inviting flexo this course and we bought
the course and we didn't sell

1102
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:10,320
a slight excess aka arm classes

1103
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,730
yeah really interested in and then in
running Rs

1104
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:16,800
as a kind of

1105
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:22,590
your code porn Shao

1106
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:26,200
yeah speaking at ever had I

1107
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:30,070
am okay for governor saying so speaking
at the code

1108
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:34,200
Paso there's like a few does like maybe
three piece of code that

1109
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,260
that make this form its work so I'll
just look at them really briefly

1110
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,760
are doing a code is actually really
simple am so this is the argument

1111
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,920
occurred

1112
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,750
its based on C probably love you for it
nor do we know can't

1113
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,160
yes anyway I just the blinking red
lights

1114
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,599
yeah think UK

1115
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,250
simply and so people complain only spend
like

1116
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:01,130
two seconds exactly what

1117
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:05,970
okay yes so where do we know is like an
electronics prototyping platform

1118
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:11,080
so basically it's like also for the you
order that's like 30 bucks

1119
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:15,160
and comes with microprocessor and a
bunch but snap its

1120
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,380
to just makes it really easy to plugin
things like sensors

1121
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:23,270
and batteries and make simple Chinese
projects

1122
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:26,670
and really the benefit event is that has
a programmable

1123
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,780
microprocessor so with Arduino

1124
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,070
basically the brains have your circuit
but mostly can come from

1125
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:36,630
this seek rights of you know see cuz
that's really convenience

1126
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:40,770
really big deal because and Senate
having a figure out

1127
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:44,400
rate resistor to get the right sensor
values you can just take the singer

1128
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,490
value and then manipulate

1129
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:49,910
am and instead of having to constantly
be changing your circuit

1130
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:53,370
you just do things in the kobe compound
via

1131
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:58,290
am so important for us to Skoda really
that anyone read so this just gives you

1132
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,370
value 50

1133
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:04,940
voltage that's on a particular pan here
to reno

1134
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:08,490
I am and so business for this for the
pressure sensor

1135
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:12,080
so on the we have voters going to the
pressure sensor and so as he squeezes

1136
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,780
resistance changes sensible to change
here

1137
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,889
and as you can see it's like a

1138
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:22,400
as you can see it says its average
incurred

1139
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,050
am service takes like 10 values from to
censor

1140
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:29,500
and

1141
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,780
okay and talking to ensuring that
occurred so that's the positive

1142
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:34,910
modulation coding porn participles

1143
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:37,980
and this is the BB code where to show
you some

1144
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:42,820
that most more actually working after
receiving your

1145
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,829
this is that code for Second Life and so

1146
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:50,079
all this code is on our website on my
website minutes beginning at strains

1147
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:50,768
real-time

1148
01:14:50,769 --> 01:14:54,629
work resist Lele work and I am

1149
01:14:54,629 --> 01:14:58,439
talking too much but all this code is on
the website

1150
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:01,919
okay sound see someone's

1151
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:08,139
yet just a quick cooks

1152
01:15:08,139 --> 01:15:15,139
like here

1153
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:36,700
hand

1154
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,739
okay so the one-time you can watch that
on our website and all the rest

1155
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:09,680
to

1156
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,820
song the chance for a minute or so last
particular can take back in like

1157
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:17,590
three minutes so a chance for immigrant

1158
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:21,280
school is the project to take

1159
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,410
cheap recycled cell phones off e-bay

1160
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:28,190
and write some stuff for spam we can
access a GPS and then

1161
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:31,320
having service and distribute them

1162
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,259
in mexico to people who are hoping to
cross the border and so we've been

1163
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:39,750
mapping out safety sites on the
us-mexico border like water cashiers

1164
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:43,470
highways Border Patrol stations whenever

1165
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,710
might get you to safety in case that you
were dang

1166
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:50,770
dehydration most common cause of death
on the us-mexico border is dehydration

1167
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:56,120
are talking estimates a fight over
10,000 people dying crossing the border

1168
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:00,309
since 1994 so this is the huge response
to the humanitarian crisis there's

1169
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:05,510
freely am and to suppress it with regard
to mean guess who's

1170
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:09,730
idea activism if you should mention just
some

1171
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:14,000
slide up so panel

1172
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,690
United at the last was about

1173
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:20,920
activism and culture champion what not

1174
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,690
card was and members so if you go back
into the whole park

1175
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:28,870
its last one you can find no his

1176
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:33,440
yeah actually introduced its its his
professor

1177
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,980
UCSD occurrence mingus am and so this
the interface for the chance we're never

1178
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:38,950
going to leave in

1179
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:42,690
you once you have turned it on on it
will direct you to the Lok

1180
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:46,110
to closest water cash and am

1181
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:51,150
project resulted in a lot of media
attention and news AP story that was

1182
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:52,570
indicated by six hundred

1183
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:56,599
news agencies worldwide video I mean a
TVR

1184
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,470
stories about it and as a result is a

1185
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:03,610
in banja investigations around us and
tool

1186
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:07,000
so the University of California

1187
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,380
received a letter from three right-wing
senators in San Diego saying that they

1188
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,370
wanted to know

1189
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:16,190
Heather how much funds are being used on
the trains were ever going to land if we

1190
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:17,340
had committed a felony

1191
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:20,340
by by submerge

1192
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,970
enticing migrant people to cross the
border am

1193
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:28,040
and those investigations are still
pending and one last thing about the

1194
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,640
phone is that includes

1195
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,730
poetry her poetic sustenance cuz we
think that's

1196
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:35,940
could help so homes like this one

1197
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:39,700
homes like this one we translate these
into audio for

1198
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,950
and you can hear them and

1199
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,800
is a legal fund for all the
investigations cuz that we have like

1200
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,630
eight lawyers at this point

1201
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:51,420
and police showing up at our offices
UCSD and

1202
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,790
that's a drag or because a are at work

1203
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:59,320
and and Tucson next project a blue boxes
travels in time

1204
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:06,320
and thanks life so

1205
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:12,400
on and like to thank you all for coming
and

1206
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,470
sitting through this and right now I've
gonna grab this piece of paper

1207
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:21,670
and put on the almighty glove

1208
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:28,110
here and I'll flip you

1209
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:31,719
that's for sure %ah

1210
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:38,330
okay so again this is

1211
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:43,000
yes someone to go home with you love me
again if you're not going to be here

1212
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,690
us throughout the weekend %uh the global
probably be arriving

1213
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:50,580
tomorrow evening arm if you're not going
to be here just

1214
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:54,519
after this coming talk with minimal will
work out ways

1215
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:59,400
so actually one 1 review come up soon
will come up in drag my hand

1216
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,520
at something review

1217
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,550
for okay

1218
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,770
okay may have to like this can tell

1219
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:12,260
okay Tagme down concern

1220
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:16,720
downer their

1221
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,820
I proceed down okay

1222
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:23,070
okay we have max p

1223
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:27,450
Maxspeed alright gun yourself

1224
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:31,780
85 virtual-reality club and a we'll talk
after this

1225
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:35,840
on so now I'm gonna open up my laptop
and connect the glove down on the Year

1226
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,270
Cheers somewhere

1227
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:41,470
and folks wanna play around if you have
any questions from the panel members

1228
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:45,780
please come up and talk with us again
you can find out more information

1229
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,599
about all of this stuff if you go to
censor research dotnet I have a week

1230
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,930
to all love the links that everyone has
provided here

1231
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:56,900
and also arm with do you I hope archives

1232
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,040
there now trying to include information
are

1233
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:03,530
and links what not with the recordings
so

1234
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,559
are you be able to find out more
information on all this

1235
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,840
on in again a at 2 a.m.

1236
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:15,880
Saturday night slash Sunday morning
paradox explore my band will be playing

1237
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,760
like she'd be able to see the glove
manipulating things and also your some

1238
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,050
really good music

1239
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:25,500
arm and guaranteed to be a good show
again thank you very much for coming

1240
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,730
I hope we gave you something to think
about when you go home some

1241
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:35,730
thank you %ah

1242
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:43,140
also a a quick plug

1243
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,680
if I I N E if you're still in town on
Tuesday

1244
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:50,710
the Arny meet up will be held

1245
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:54,850
its run by Rory was telling you about
Steven Feiner usually shows up

1246
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:58,400
worth going to aircraft and I think it's
like it out
