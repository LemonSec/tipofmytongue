35
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,620
addicted like the crackhead to hacking
emphasis ok thank you katharine

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,459
I so let me take the picture for you and
let me get into me to this

37
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,750
back in 2003 Canada

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,610
agreed basically blew a cascaded down

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,160
into Europe in there was a blackout
obviously people from New York remember

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,430
now what they didn't tell you was that
in 2003

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,510
this that same week the slammer worm
came out

42
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,160
and infected that network so

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,500
allegedly allegedly I like to use that
word it affected

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,849
and that's the reason why there was a
blackout but

45
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,518
our sages do your research look it up
but

46
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,150
from my perspective that's the reason
why to blackout occurred so

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,019
cybersecurity this came out in a brew
turney

48
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,040
Tony Blair testifies at the Telogis
comedian

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,609
malicious cyber activity is growing

50
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,849
on president rate Google search

51
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,390
MPR cyber in security he saying we

52
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,080
are losing the battle is just too much

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,340
for us to handle and that's the
government

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,019
Americans whatever you wanna call it the
private sector

55
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,099
the government sector should have gone
to shit

56
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,330
but we gotta fight back so here's my
hacker highlights

57
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,450
back in June 2007 20

58
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,980
terabytes was stolen from the government
now

59
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,930
what I can understand is how twenty
terror by such stolen

60
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,900
an nobody knows 20 terabytes is the
library of congress you know how much

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,780
data is that

62
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,280
salata data so August 2008 8

63
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,689
during the campaigns and stuff like that
way to go body arm

64
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:04,470
late fashion would be Libra hackers gain
access to the McCain and Obama

65
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,220
headquarters and basically hack emails

66
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,540
July 2009 cyber attacks were launched
against government private

67
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,079
sector now here's the cake

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,750
virgin your Social Security Agency was
basically hacked

69
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,880
they basically encrypt it all the social
security's

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,330
from %uh numbers for Virginia and
basically

71
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,659
axe for ransom for ten million dollars
guess what virginia did

72
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,830
and a guest besides the people in front
row

73
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,198
yea repeat that a million dollars but
here's the question his the cool shit

74
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,150
the guy was really honest he basically
gave him back the information

75
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,000
and was like you know what not only you
can have your ship back and I won't post

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,259
it up in a form

77
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:56,340
but here's what I did to hack it and
here's the fix to it

78
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,780
so I thought that was kind of like
honest and

79
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,250
a sort of way like pen testing way like

80
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,470
at broke into shit and then now you
gotta pay me

81
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,699
all right now he is the fix so I thought
that was cool and I was just like

82
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,509
holy shit man that do get some sacks

83
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,460
so this I don't know for any have you
seen Zeus

84
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,448
I gave it me the malware award of the
year

85
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,419
now I don't know how many working
corporations large corporations and you

86
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,520
have these applications to push out your
abs and stuff like that

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,940
visits back end has

88
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,370
the ability to push out applications our
roll it out in my corporation

89
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,009
so I don't give a damn what anybody says
like

90
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,259
abuse me this is what I use because you
can push applications

91
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,740
you perform at hard drives you could do
a lot of cool stuff with these

92
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,050
if you google semantic Zeus the first
link they have a video

93
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,130
on underground like web sites obviously
they block it out but we had actors we

94
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:03,810
know

95
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,860
exactly where these forms are and they
have

96
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,310
like botnets for sale that's running
Zeus like four hundred dollars I think

97
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,699
it's you

98
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:18,030
like for 500 machines and if you wanna

99
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,419
pay a lot of money like a thousand ten
thousand dollars you get a lot of

100
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,639
machines

101
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,740
so definitely look this up man this is
100

102
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,270
baddest now where's and another thing I
want to say this isn't

103
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,000
one person creating this this is like a
crime family

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,110
this is like a team of people in Brazil
China

105
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,110
this is a whole team doing this so mean
kudos and I'm

106
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,280
probably got a SVN somewhere

107
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,419
so p what is now but this was a honeypot

108
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:51,508
is a versatile tool that lets me know
where net but this

109
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,860
on a pant this emulates known
vulnerabilities

110
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,810
basically when a binary hits the box it
downloads it for you to go ahead in

111
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,069
reverse engineer

112
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:05,110
and find out what the hell is going on
so

113
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,430
come over clicker know thy enemy

114
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,970
AVN IDS refined signatures to detect it

115
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,160
so if there's no signature they want
protected

116
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,720
and I don't know about you but semantic
and bodywork his mentor cue

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,530
please no our core their shady

118
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,210
for that don't even have a navy yeah
they're really really bad

119
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,340
it yep

120
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,030
so the better and more we know about now
where

121
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,580
you know we could push up to them give
them

122
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,508
the information they need to set us give
us a signature stuff like that and

123
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,000
you know your environment what's going
on so when collecting now where you also

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,919
could could generate

125
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,008
statistics for your employees and tell
them listen

126
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,400
this is what we need we need you to roll
it out and we need it now so

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,220
it gives use the statistics you need to
basically go ahead

128
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,460
and have the ammunition to get you shit

129
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,210
so I was consultant at the company

130
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,639
there has two hundred thousand
workstations now

131
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,580
that is insane it's hard to manage

132
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,919
is hard to know what's going on
everywhere so when they got infected

133
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,490
and I think maybe like 10,000 machines
got infected

134
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,569
they told me you know what we have the
money we're fortune 100 company

135
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,159
it doesn't matter would throw money at
the problem virus impact

136
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,309
that's not a problem with your money at
it what happened was

137
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,589
their manufacture facility where they
manufacture

138
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,029
their drinks soft drinks so you have an
idea

139
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:49,500
warehouse consultant at basically got
hit with a virus

140
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,970
and it came to a halt and it was like oh
my god what we have to do said he sent

141
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,839
this to Brazil to fix it

142
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,080
and I was like you see sure to listen so

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,510
what I do was introduce the paint this

144
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,130
and when I introduce that I was like
first we need to know

145
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,950
where's our attack vector and then once
we figure out what's going on and we

146
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,220
find out the signatures and stuff like
that

147
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,660
we can update the clueless a vis so they
could give us the signature

148
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,560
so that we could push it out so the last
thing I like to see about an apparent

149
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,019
this

150
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,300
is free 99 if you don't know was free 99

151
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,730
for anything free for me i won

152
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,890
so I know you said showed and I'm a take
a look at that tonight as soon as a job

153
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,140
or so

154
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,980
is free it's up to you so yeah

155
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,110
I so this is how we basically rolled it
out

156
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,399
in their corporation they have a
business unit

157
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,149
in every country in the world so what we
did was

158
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,010
we don't want to do that we took the net
but this collect and put it in the

159
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,519
biggest business unit in that company

160
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,250
and then we pushed it up to CW Sam box
which is %uh automated analysis we

161
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,750
here's the thing that's not free because
twelve thousand dollars

162
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,730
but here's a trick right where hackers
right so you call the company

163
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,519
you can hear it is for me now from Marco
you call the company

164
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,860
you Axum I want to try a product out
give me a thirty

165
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,079
day trial

166
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,620
to have to say more I don't think so so
once they give you that 30-day trial

167
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,089
there goes your software now depend how
good are you

168
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,470
think you can get a free

169
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,709
exactly so once we put it on a network
we seem to 100

170
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:43,529
we see no 150 to 200 mao where like
binaries hit in these boxes

171
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,640
it was ramping and we was like you see
shoulda listened to me earlier

172
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,720
we can spend that much money now we know
where where we getting hit at

173
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,870
and it was better for us and it was free
so I look like a superstar I was like to

174
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,440
see

175
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,529
now you don't have to spend a hundred
thousand you could give me that money

176
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,170
made into a by the way so it depends
this has vulnerability modules

177
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,699
I'll get into later why I think the pent
this

178
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,490
has limitations I'm you kid add

179
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,170
basically like modules to it they don't
have good documentation

180
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,469
on it the shoko thank you Kevin show
code handler

181
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:29,029
and download handlers they have as well
I don't know if you concede

182
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,950
what I seen there's not a lot of updates
with an appendix

183
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,579
I think the last think they're is and
miss 05

184
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:41,320
yeah so it hasn't been updated I think
that was shitty to

185
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,209
you know if you gonna put out even
though it's a good honey pie I think you

186
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,180
should basically

187
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,230
updated on a consistent basis and they
don't do that

188
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,430
so the winders lovers in him sorry

189
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,190
they don't have binary for you go so you
could is torn up at this but

190
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,540
here is the installations for BSD

191
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,269
DBN 0 chaos Gentoo

192
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:07,050
yeah source users is this so

193
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,160
its easily you could is basically run
eight downloaded

194
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,550
just type depend this and it starts
working

195
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,190
is just right there wait a few it to
capture some binary so that's what's

196
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,220
cool about it

197
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:27,209
okay come on Flickr

198
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,070
yeah there we go so here's some other
malware analysis captured with net but

199
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,720
this

200
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,930
as you see CW as version

201
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:40,070
which is a little but when its stores
father stores that were md5 hash

202
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,139
you could basically see the lab half
what's going on

203
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,350
the file name and the five if you go to
DIN

204
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,510
going to next liar a No so if you see
towards the bottom

205
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,110
it tells you the creative process and
the installation and once it hits stores

206
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,660
you see the destination file court
windows system32

207
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Armin that EXE now that is pretty fast

208
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,740
so you see to pee I D the file name

209
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,470
if you look down a head start I'm tree a
process so here's the interesting stuff

210
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,110
now it's starting to look to go ahead
the

211
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,649
Armin looking to connect to

212
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,060
my niece closure runs their sex CCC that

213
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,560
serve FTP dot com so it tries to connect
their can't resolve

214
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,990
and then it goes to the next one sexy
C-dot 88

215
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,899
which that CX and the results to that IP
address

216
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,360
so that now where basically went out to
connect to

217
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,579
a botnet so if you see in the next slide
here's the cool shit

218
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,220
it connected to 6666

219
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,019
protocol IRC look at the nigga try to
use

220
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:59,019
XP Deus moon Windows

221
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,100
is the channel name is powell POWELL
tibia to

222
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,570
the password is to be a blow so right
now you have to battle so

223
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,920
not only can you summit to semantic

224
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,680
the signature love where is infecting
but as well as a signature for your

225
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,000
ideas

226
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,110
so

227
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,380
it connects are it opens up a local port
in 1910

228
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,250
socket 1392 let's get to meet a vid

229
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,190
alright your general approach so when
you set up a controlled environment you

230
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,139
wanna obviously haven't VMware stuff
like that you want to perform

231
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:44,149
behavior analysis and examine other
interaction with the environment

232
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,459
like there's ninety percent you couldn

233
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,190
you see the abuse and box to do stuff
like that but then there's that

234
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,410
other 10 percent that you gonna have to
basically do it manually you gonna have

235
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,480
to go into ID a pro Ali debugger windy
burger

236
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,540
to go ahead and find out what you
messing

237
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:08,149
so here summer you to HS what you should
have in you to a chest

238
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:12,709
obviously VMware goals you want to
monitor your local workstation

239
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,160
and basically a network arm

240
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,399
I use fake DNS or honey D is another

241
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,519
honey pot you can use my favorites Rida
pro

242
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,449
well so I use and windy burger

243
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:31,720
I had one in yet

244
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,649
10+2 yeah the three downloads that has

245
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,470
now it's its anybody ever heard a
backtrack

246
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,990
region summer give my boy shameless plug

247
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,290
he claims that 10+2 is better so I i

248
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,319
I give you a shout out bro he got

249
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,980
how many as well 100 alleles for

250
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,250
so is the limitations with year his the
limitations with net plant this

251
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,130
it only downloads binaries if you put it
on edge

252
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,610
I've like let's say for your home uses
you put it on edge you're not going to

253
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,600
see the HTML that flies by

254
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,029
no just drop it is like you start seeing
some weird shit for home users that want

255
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,829
to do it and put it on the edge

256
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:24,310
nope end this you start seeing some
crazy crazy shit

257
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,509
what I wanted to figure out as well

258
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,620
was that one night keV we was a the
China was here in our box right

259
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,850
year was here in our box n

260
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,690
yeah I I copied it I did a yeah I did a
print screen

261
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,149
so China was here in our box right and
I'm like you can have look at this man

262
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,160
we're getting attacked Burnett but this
what it was doing

263
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,160
it was in a binary so it was droppin and
I was like damn

264
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,800
so what I did was basically did a print
screen editor

265
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,259
and map to that box and it was basically
was it was a pot

266
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,149
it was a server though in China that was
basically taken over and there was doing

267
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,900
attacks from that box

268
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,640
but it was cool it was I think with
there was someone watches like Rolex is

269
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,059
you know it's fakers was from China

270
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,299
so and malware is getting smarter

271
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:20,089
there's some cool shit are you starting
to see with the binaries

272
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:25,510
is really really good I recommend you
definitely put it on the edge

273
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,350
and and capture stuff put it on your
corporate networks put it in your home

274
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,580
inside internal on internal network to
see if there's any traffic that's going

275
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,330
on

276
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,270
as people get affected in don't even
know so this is one way you can do it

277
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,710
so that was the first Partida
presentations so

278
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,559
I definitely wanted to make an
announcement and this is the right

279
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,230
form to do it on so it's cool for or
happy or hackers

280
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:59,230
is course Holland tools that come

281
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,090
give once a body a

282
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,678
is this is part of the announcement not
there you go

283
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,059
there you go so

284
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,678
it's basically up if you go to Shaolin
tools that come

285
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,799
you see the countdown and the starter
shala tools

286
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,539
it started with being denied

287
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:30,299
for blackhat the re times now if you
don't know what black hat is

288
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,429
I think it's next are two weeks from now
in Las Vegas

289
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,840
they have a conference call black at its
Wednesday and Thursday

290
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,250
that's like the only conference that I
haven't spoke at

291
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,919
and have been submitted to them and I'm
pissed

292
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,980
I'm frustrated I'm like through

293
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,450
yeah I'm have to do b-sides but

294
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:57,990
whatever so I was I was questioning my
judo and my Kong Phooey my ninja skills

295
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,710
he liked him and what he might do in
when I receive that the Nile you this

296
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,380
year I was

297
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,360
really really Pierce I took two days and
I said to myself

298
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,760
what the hell am I gonna do that number
one next year

299
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,789
I'm gonna be accepted number two

300
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,640
to three years from now I'm gonna still
be except it regardless if I wanna talk

301
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,840
about rats and roaches

302
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,110
soho I came up with this thing caught 36
chambers a Shaolin tools

303
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,350

312
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,070
if you do beta testing if you do web
sites we need that as well

313
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,399
so its open to everybody so open forum

442
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,490
your year well no

443
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,270
awesome awesome on that what was
happening was semantic

444
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,410
is that we was waiting for a five days
for one signature

445
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,710
now if you're infected you wait four
days for a signature update

446
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,220
is gone it is gonna basically in fact
half your network

447
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,440
so the big thing was this with whiff

448
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,030
the infections was the big yellow has
anybody heard of the big yellow

449
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,270
which was semantic it was a

450
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,460
a virus or malware for Symantec

451
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,280
it basically attacked Symantec and we do
have their signature

452
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,040
and was like six months behind man
that's when the 10,000 got affected

453
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,110
so what we did was we basically

454
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,340
had the net but this and we had XML

455
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,110
file so we would push it to semantic

456
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,710
and what we did was since they were
stupid and they don't want to give us

457
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,530
some body

458
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:59,639
on our like work with us on our network
and stuff like that what we did was we

459
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,010
had a enterprise Rep

460
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,970
and basically we will push the XML file
what all the details

461
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,570
so all they had to do was create the
signature

462
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,240
like you don't have to do any work just
look at the file create the signature

463
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,040
and push it back so the reason why I
took them four days is biz

464
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,460
because we had to submit the binary
they're basically reverse it find out

465
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,470
what they're doing

466
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,460
and take their sweet ass time so they
don't have an argument for us

467
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,680
we gave you all the information you
don't have to do nothing

468
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,190
except write a signature so

469
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,950
any other questions I'm sorry I just
wanted to party

470
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:42,920
and in 10 questions yeah nonono nononono
go head to head

471
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,040
submit

472
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,200
yeah

473
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,420
no no no no

474
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,820
because what we had a contract with
Symantec and it was on

475
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,090
all our boxes so we needed the
signatures like yesterday

476
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,210
so unison yeah

477
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,990
it was within four hours

478
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:16,290
so it was pretty good because we have
their relationship with the enterprise

479
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,428
a semantic AV and there was pushing it
back to us

480
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,290
immediately for them to push back our

481
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:28,700
the signatures it took four days before
we

482
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,679
submitted the XML file to them before
week went through that process

483
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,400
if we just took a binary and submitted
to them it would take them for days

484
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,500
to get back to us which was unacceptable
in a

485
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,480
enterprise network you know any other
questions

486
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,310
are

487
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,760
