1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,540
executive this is Jamie

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,710
were you among other folks I'll

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,679
where do you go to work on a month your
project or talk about I'm

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,019
fixing authentication on the network
today a

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,340
so um so I'm single and I read in

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,529
if you have questions you should feel
free to raise your hand i'm happy to

7
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,150
engage questions during the talk

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,150
I'm we're gonna

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,970
serve take turns on pieces other I'm
broke into doing was to the initial

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,549
speaking

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,030
but and hearing what's up room for

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,520
no question that the end to you to okay
to

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,129
the first question is what's broken
what's the problem what would we need to

14
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,349
fix right white this artist fixing
authentication

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,489
so um and then just the general outline
here

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,039
rather talk about in particular a
problem with some really common forms

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,379
have

18
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,099
love cryptographic authentication on the
net and then how we're gonna fix it and

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,660
with our

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,149
OpenPGP and the market's fear so just a

21
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:04,339
just as a a check here a.m.

22
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,429
folks know about OpenPGP here

23
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,990
so nice a look at the room for people
and know that they're probably a lot of

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,530
people here who know about b2b but
someone although

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,810
a member explained as some dessert to
you so okay so wise up indication

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,970
important this is the what's broken part
here

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,490
um so so we were communicating over
mediated network

28
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,229
wanna main problems is that what a
messages that you want to be

29
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:29,310
confidential can be sniffed by somebody

30
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,820
who a you maybe don't want to read them
um

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,369
so there's a there's a privacy issue
that's not exactly about authentication

32
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:37,670
but is about privacy

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,100
right and we don't know when that
happened in others issues that something

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,860
might send your message and you know who
that message actually came from

35
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,009
it says a you know let's meet at the
pier

36
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,810
8 p.m. ways that the person you're
trying to be the beard AP embers that

37
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,570
somebody else during you out to the pier

38
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm justina if you're too few kg like
that but that the message might also say

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,450
I'm I yeah let's go ahead with that plan
at work

40
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,850
you might also say arm a

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,959
you know node you know

42
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,069
don't worry about paying me back that
loan there's a whole bunch of things

43
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,970
that the messages could saying that we
do not know who is who

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,720
it was sent so up indications are and
pretty obvious requirement for solving

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,230
some

46
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,079
sorry my am I going in and out here
because a que by mice

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,580
I'm so it's an obvious requirement for
solving the second problem

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,220
right message George been dubious for
authentication is also a requirement

49
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,319
for the first from the confidentiality
so when you have a communication over

50
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,360
media network

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,769
I'm you can have a confidential
communication covered it all means

52
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,489
only the parties that I want to have
access to the content of the

53
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,160
communication

54
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,730
have access to it so if I don't know who
the other side of the party is

55
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,260
then I can't have confidential
communication otherwise I'm just

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,590
I'm having us a private conversation
with somebody

57
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,310
doesn't actually mean anything so in
order to actually have

58
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,090
good private communication you actually
need to know who the other party is

59
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,959
now you might be willing to accept
anonymous communications from somebody

60
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,780
else but if they don't know who you are

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,530
and this one-sided it has to actually be
authenticated and

62
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,800
for it to be to actually be potentially
confidential so

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,569
here's one existing method that we
currently use today to

64
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,840
to authenticate things on the network so

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,069
open SSH no menu use open SSH

66
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,370
or run SSH servers probably I'm you've
probably seen this a lot

67
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,769
this is meaningless right

68
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,090
regular people look at this and they say
%uh yes

69
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,120
yes yes yeah to totally

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,560
that's it I'm so this is a real problem
because

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,230
when you say yes you're what you're
doing is you're saying yes I'm sure that

72
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,110
this is the host and I'm trying to
connect to you

73
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,420
if it have limited network means that
there's lots of points in between that

74
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,840
could be taking over that

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,209
that connection and said you just say
yes year and cross your fingers

76
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,420
you don't really know who you're getting
now does provide some continuity

77
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,010
like you can be sure that the next time
you connected probably isn't

78
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,170
something that changed but there are
other issues with this in on top of it

79
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,560
being totally incomprehensible to the
average human being

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,879
so okay so that's open a sitter at the
key is providing the wire you have your

81
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,489
client

82
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,780
a.m. at I V

83
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,949
there's an anchor to tunnel that it an
anonymous tunnel sort of the dick

84
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,020
sets up to the server in the server
provides its public key so basic public

85
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,039
key cryptography

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,290
I'm the its fancy math but basically you
have

87
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,930
a secret thing that you hold any other
public thing and you wanna provide that

88
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,850
public thing

89
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,500
a to the other party the math works
great the problem is how do you connect

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,669
these keys

91
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,820
to the partisan question and so in SSH

92
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,680
never saw that prop that it's actually
happening the wire there I'm

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
so one thing you could do is you could
call somebody up on phone usually what

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,410
happens

95
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,520
it sorted out abandon this is is nothing
right

96
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,159
so I'm but you could also call your
admin on the phone who here has

97
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,090
ever called their administrator and said
is this the proper pose key fingerprint

98
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,840
alright um who year as an admin has
gotten such a call

99
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,120
from users alright well that's like

100
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,360
the most hands I've ever seen race for
that question that's pretty awesome it's

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,970
still

102
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,740
it still beautiful um I'm glad you guys
did it but

103
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,830
but the proportions are really really
love we're not doing authentication in

104
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,050
that sense right now

105
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,710
I'm realistically in most in those
connections and

106
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,849
so what we what we want to be like to
have a a smooth the rave do if handling

107
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,360
that

108
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,199
so here's another way that we do
authentication on the network today see

109
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm going to bed

110
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,580
a excusing it go to a bank the Seattle
metropolitan credit union

111
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,289
it's their secure website owned by the
type in some highly confidential

112
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,139
financial information

113
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,280
um some connected with this web browser

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,830
I'm and there's a little lock down in
the corner and if I hover over the

115
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,460
locketts has authenticated by Verisign

116
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,560
withheld their sin red is Versailles my
bank

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,710
drug could Versailles nothing to get
somebody else's my bank this is a

118
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,979
classic man in the middle attack

119
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,659
concern and if I trust their sign in
Verisign is able

120
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,740
to be the man in the middle by the way I
never configured my web browser to trust

121
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,380
their sin

122
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,460
nonetheless it seems to work make this
I'm at

123
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,169
that's a bad thing so X number nine this
is like this message collection

124
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,849
red instead of passing the raw public
you pass a certificate the certificate

125
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,120
is this thing

126
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,190
and the Middle the pipe here and
pointing at the screen which US can see

127
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,630
it's going down um so

128
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,270
so the um so the authentication

129
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,729
yeah exactly I'm so in this case we
actually have a little bit out a band

130
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:47,949
communication the web browser has the a
certificate authorities

131
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,000
is own certificate which amounts to
basically all we care about is

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,139
the has it's difficult for his public
key stored by the fall

133
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,449
in the web browser that's Verisign right
there CA is the certificate authority

134
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:02,620
so here our client already knows about
tax because it

135
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,240
knew about it when we downloaded it and
when you get this certificate you can

136
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,449
check that seal that was on that
certificate

137
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:15,449
is actually right so what's this what's
the certificate up

138
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,539
technically there's a there's a self CO
it stamped itself but

139
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,520
it you can't verify it itself the reason
that you're that you're trusting it

140
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,650
is because it was shipped with your
browser I'm we can argue about whether

141
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,310
that actual trust

142
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,979
so the common patterns years that one
pure shows the other peers public key

143
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:37,258
maybe in a certificate during a session
um and notice the direction here this is

144
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,039
about us authenticating

145
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,139
the bank is about us authenticating the
remote server

146
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,720
not the other direction now you can also
use these

147
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,590
these technologies to go in the other
direction not that many people do who

148
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,789
uses

149
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,490
SSH public keys as a user

150
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,729
are I ate nice and Hoosier uses

151
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,500
X 509 client certificates on the web

152
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,379
wow okay alright cool that people are
using some %uh that

153
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,120
it's pretty uncommon usually use super
crappy things like passwords

154
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,479
and we're not going to arena so okay so
what's the certificate for X 509

155
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,830
I'm it's an identity that's bound to

156
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,609
a public key and the whole thing is
signed by certificate authority

157
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,069
does that make sense as far as the with
publicly stuff works

158
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,410
another way to look at it is hey there's
this difficult already in it says

159
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,089
I'm telling you this this being has this
public key

160
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,570
this is how are binding these things
together concrete Lee Verisign was

161
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,750
saying that's the Mac

162
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,179
course after also know that some say you
got orders to back

163
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,649
so what happens if you don't believe the
certifying authority well

164
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,140
in a.m. well there is no certifying 13
SSH

165
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,170
I'm and then on the web you get

166
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,089
pages like this which are also I would
argue about as meaningless as that first

167
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:56,990
SSH

168
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,019
view particular to regular human beings

169
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,570
and sin for one thing all the
terminology people use

170
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,190
tends to be sorted garbage terminology
the message here says it has

171
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,209
untrusted that's not true its

172
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,339
it is up this is not anticipate question
right

173
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:17,149
we need to know who we're talking to you
if I know if I know for sure

174
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,680
but I'm talking to george bush that
doesn't mean it's a trusted connection

175
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,200
doesn't mean that I that that I trust
him right

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,800
it means that I know who he is so so the
issue here is authenticity

177
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,740
not trust so we were it's been
consistently used the wrong language in

178
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,769
a lot of the stuff

179
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,980
I'm however in that situation where my
bank was authenticated by Verisign their

180
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,300
is a trust issue involved but it's not
about me trusting my bank

181
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,220
its army trusting Verisign to be sure
that I'm talking to the bank

182
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,480
and i think thats and that that actually
is a trust issue and it's not actually

183
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,680
about real human trust

184
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,360
so for X 509 which is the certificate
model is used for the web

185
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,910
um that is a

186
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,390
a the main problem and I will argue this
quite strongly

187
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,630
is that X 509 has exactly 1 certifier

188
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,700
when you offer that certificate only one
party can have certified it

189
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,940
and that's it there's no way to get to
choose trust as

190
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,180
maybe I don't trust their sign maybe I
trust no

191
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,329
a who's your favorite certificate
authority

192
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:23,100
CN Nick yet maybe I prefer to trust the
Chinese Internet authority over

193
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,910
over Versailles right I don't have that
choice because that certificates only

194
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,149
been signed by Verisign

195
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,220
um so and and

196
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,390
also I've automatic be trusted all love
the authorities in my browser who knows

197
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:36,880
how many

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,709
to give your thirties are implicitly
trust in their browser today choosing

199
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,720
pick your browser and tell me with how
many there are

200
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,420
anybody

201
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,500
%uh so he says Firefox and 200 ices I
think Firefox's

202
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,230
sorry 0 8200 I think actually Firefox is
more like thirty

203
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,610
I think Internet Explorer right now is
about 200 or something I don't have the

204
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,540
exact numbers

205
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,800
it's a lot and and its weakest link

206
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
the point here is that if any one of
those

207
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,880
is compromised then the person who
controls

208
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,010
or simply delicious the person who
controls that

209
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,410
that we just one can compromise all over
network connections if they have access

210
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:18,760
to them

211
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,910
paper by creating a a false certificate
and doing a man in the middle attack

212
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,230
um it's also a so that's

213
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,440
um it was a difficult to change who you
trust if I say I don't trust Versailles

214
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,980
and I don't no longer can really get
access to that bank

215
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,290
and so this whole thing is this its it's
a social logjam

216
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,569
it's a it's a big massive relationships
I was gonna briefly illustrate that

217
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,110
message relationships

218
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,040
so this is what we care about right the
user's

219
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,990
want to connect to services that are run
by service administrators

220
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,760
right so this is the blue year that me
and the green there's my back

221
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,029
K but the users using a tool right
they're relying on the tool to actually

222
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,269
have functional crypto

223
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:02,800
true but they're also relying on the
tour to tell me

224
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,950
who's in the certificate authority
cartel sure the certificate authorities

225
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,680
that I should actually trust

226
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,690
and the service administrator has to go
to the certificate authority cartel

227
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,920
and basically purchase this is a
business model it's an amazing business

228
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,349
model

229
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,769
if you can get a business where what you
do is you sell large numbers to people

230
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,339
do it its awesome

231
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,959
so so they go to visit this figure 3
cartel may make a deal was difficult

232
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,310
very cartel

233
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,670
now that they've made that deal they've
got that single certifier

234
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,639
a certificate then eyes these are now
have a relationship with the sea

235
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,389
see a cartel a that I have to keep
because I want to keep going to that

236
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:39,899
user

237
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,560
did too to that service right so all of
a sudden I have to have this

238
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,339
relationship with the CIA cartel

239
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,720
independent worked with him using if my
if my web browser was to say

240
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,339
drop Verisign as a default which might
argue would be a reasonable thing to do

241
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,430
of a sudden if I'm a naive user I would
how your

242
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,920
update broke my connection to my back
because

243
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,350
I can no longer because because the bank
is already made the agreement with their

244
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,290
sin

245
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,709
and then of course now there's a
relationship also between the service

246
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:09,120
administrators in the tool vendors

247
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,240
in that the service administers when
they choose which

248
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,790
certificate authority to use Bates
choose it by looking at what web

249
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,120
browsers that users use

250
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,800
and what are the default lists because
no one's actually explicitly setting

251
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,810
these things because you can't

252
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,029
mean you technically can but no no show
of hands who does

253
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,639
Hoosiers actually removed entities from
their trusted certificate thirties

254
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,920
missed

255
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,990
just the China one a guy who is your
router's removed anything

256
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,740
other than China okay good

257
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,149
and three years removed all of them

258
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,550
alright very interesting I i want to
hear about how you browse the web at

259
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,660
some point

260
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,920
sir and her

261
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,680
a really good Firefox add-on okay cool I
wanna talk about that after its that's

262
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,480
great

263
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,690
um so yes well at work

264
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,310
certain

265
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,420
yeah grew so who here has actually added
certificate authorities to their

266
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,740
mister trusted certificate authorities
okay

267
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,339
I'm anybody wanna call out a favor one
that you think other people should add

268
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,300
yeah let's all be that it hurts right
that's all there

269
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,339
so okay so let's go back to me talking
to my bank your who do I really trust

270
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,510
you I really trust these

271
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,600
these various entities when well

272
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,170
I do you have to trust my brother but
what about some of these other folks

273
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,779
right

274
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,389
I could trust University of Washington
rather relationship with Seattle

275
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:42,519
miss brown coat girly I could just
another crediting the Boeing Employees

276
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,329
Credit Union

277
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,560
I could trust the National Credit Union
Association I could trust

278
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,220
another credit union from Mission the in
the Mission District in San Francisco

279
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,680
or some other user my trust me that's me

280
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,029
when I was little hairier also yeah

281
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,740
I'm actually not the unibomber

282
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,060
so so fit says me and you should just me
so

283
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,670
so so why are all of these entities that
are out here in the in this Whitefield

284
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,639
wire they excluded from being the trust
identities they have a lot more to say

285
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,850
about whether this is actually my credit
union

286
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,230
then does Firefox or Versailles Norstar
field or

287
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,079
CN Dec right so how come they're out
there are excluded because if this dense

288
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,440
network of relationships that creates
the certain in secure

289
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,570
sticking point so let's break this break
open a larger well let's briefly

290
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,529
maybe we could argue that the lodge in
with a broken because if they screw up

291
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,689
well we'd have to come out right that
doesn't happen it does not happen

292
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,199
we haven't seen a majors difficult
authorities get ejected because you

293
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,730
simply can't afford to remove them

294
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,000
your if you're a tool vendor you can't
afford to remove their sin

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,480
so 2001 bears an issue because Microsoft
certificate authority

296
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,709
a Microsoft certificate to we don't know
who

297
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,420
tooth 2010 Microsoft is it not only
including them

298
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,329
still but they're actively choosing them
to sign off on all their

299
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:10,209
their suffered a plugin for Windows
Mobile rapid SSL I don't know if you

300
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,459
guys remember the

301
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,740
the hash bash stuff that went on the
when was that

302
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,250
2008 um as rapid as a so

303
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,420
been removed from your you know from
your

304
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,810
your browser's oh no they don't do that
anymore don't worry

305
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,100
but there's no there's been no
punishment for

306
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,820
that isn't there's no demonstration that
people actually get ejected from the

307
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,399
cartel

308
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,290
has a larger and and so some other
reason you mind I want to trust people

309
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,290
in the cartel

310
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,290
on commercial historical reasons a so

311
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,300
some stuff there secret material has
been has been held by multiple different

312
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,990
for-profit party's over the course of
many years how secure is a secret that's

313
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,199
been held by multiple parties especially
with information that can just be copied

314
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,050
it's not so much the government's I
don't care which governments you don't

315
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,639
trust

316
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,430
but you can take your pick you might not
just China Manchester key managers the

317
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,779
Netherlands managers Rizzo

318
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,209
they're all in there right now look look
at your

319
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,870
you're better list those folks can man
in the middle and you have dirty let's

320
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,169
connections by being present

321
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,110
in that Transit Authority managers to
protect legal reasons cuz they do stupid

322
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,309
things like using a 1024 that our city

323
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,559
that was created in 1998 I'm

324
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,879
so mister same get really far as a 10
reforming our essay at the end of this

325
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,539
year

326
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:27,059
do not use it period I'm and

327
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,070
even for previous years there was like
don't use it don't expect to use it for

328
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,668
more than

329
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,600
you know three or four years at the max
this is 12 years old now

330
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,350
um and their companies that actively
market men in the middle devices

331
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,209
there's a paper on this route relatively
recently a

332
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,280
and is about a discussion on the T on
this working group about them

333
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,200
these folks the only way to make
something like this work is if you

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,910
actually have a relationship

335
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,100
I'm with either you've already rooted
and users box which is this something

336
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,590
work

337
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,709
or you have a relationship with the
certificate authority and I don't think

338
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,890
anything's been documented in any
particular

339
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,770
widely trusted certificate authorities
selling these men in the middle boxes or

340
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,299
partnering with them but it's not hard
to imagine that it would be lucrative

341
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,168
lucrative quietly over somebody in that
position so we break the logjam with a

342
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:14,890
multi certifier option

343
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,250
if the certificate can have multiple
certifiers then wielded

344
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,690
it it breaks the whole thing open the
users can choose now

345
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,630
to say no I don't need to trust their
sin because the certificates been signed

346
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,110
by some other folks address the other
folks

347
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,640
service administers get more options
they don't have to just use from the

348
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,470
cartel

349
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,480
the tool vendors on have to be in the
position of shipping the default cartel

350
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,400
anymore or if they do it's a much less

351
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,610
it's a much less pressured position if
there's a wide the wider the adoption

352
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,520
yet

353
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,570
and there's if if we want to we can
remove the weakest link failure mode

354
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,720
you no longer have to say okay here's
the list

355
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,210
love 30 parties that can do a man in the
middle tack on another matter

356
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,240
connections you can say here's 10
parties

357
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,160
and I'd like to see to have them
corroborate each other certifications

358
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,559
answer it it makes it it starts to make
things a little more secure for people

359
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,168
who want to use that you can still
represent the current arrangement

360
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,990
and the the current you can still decide
I'll just

361
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,910
any of these guys to man in the middle
with you want to you but now there's

362
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,669
options to

363
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,100
to start having more nuanced policy so
was an open mic a

364
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,919
was a multi certifier public key
infrastructure we've got one has existed

365
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:19,770
for a long time

366
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,470
its OpenPGP home it's the original
social network

367
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,520
right so you you find out

368
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,299
who you know and you figure out who they
are and once you've done that key

369
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,370
exchange

370
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,419
you can actually have secured an
authenticated

371
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:38,450
and potentially private communications
with people over the network

372
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,570
it's usually used I'm issues for for you
know

373
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,610
a but the certification format

374
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,950
is just like the certification from it
with a good for X 509 in a lot of ways

375
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,760
except that its multi certifier capable

376
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,879
and it doesn't provide as nice a
businessman for the folks were already

377
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,630
in the cartel unfortunately

378
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,350
but I without book argue on the business
model things your media

379
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,320
and because I think it's I think there
is still a business model if you wanna

380
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,689
let people continue

381
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,490
in that position own so why OpenPGP

382
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,850
turned its its the authentication that
happens in TLS

383
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,480
and SSH is analogous situations like
figure at

384
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,270
email and we want to make sure reusing
existing tools we don't invent new

385
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,740
certificate formats

386
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,330
we don't wanna um one we don't do that
because

387
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,340
we do it wrong I'm sure I would do it
wrong if I meant that is

388
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,439
certificate format off-the-shelf myself
this has a a lot of people looking out

389
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,750
over the years

390
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,350
and for two we don't do that because the
more that we can get

391
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,630
own authentication format to work across
a bunch of

392
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,220
contexts the more useful it is to
participate in that authentication

393
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,309
format there's a network affect your

394
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:50,450
I'm so we want to reuse tools for that
reason alone um

395
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,820
and it turns out we can do without
changing the protocols and wire

396
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,049
so there's this new out a band
possibility with BGP

397
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,940
so OK quick overview of what we've got
we've got X 509 we've got open SSH

398
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,720
um we've got I think people could
pronounce this spooky but I'm

399
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,460
I don't actually no need to use it
spooky okay

400
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,220
okay spooky inside CIA

401
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,090
um over alright cool

402
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,949
um I don't think it's actually really
widely used right now a.m.

403
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,020
okay no one uses it says the working
group chair

404
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,070
I'm sorry for um and then OpenPGP which

405
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,789
rich has a fairly wide user base not
anything approaching the user base an x5

406
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:34,400
and I'm

407
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,130
which is included but for with your
browser but OpenPGP is out there it's

408
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,080
been used

409
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,730
and then we have we have some tools so
more as possible

410
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,350
um I already talked about this

411
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,070
so the other band feature is done
without be too picky server networks are

412
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,059
the keys are never for a BGP is a really
neat system

413
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,210
that is distributed its globally
distributed it is

414
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,409
um it's not something that one entity
could

415
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:03,270
take control over it's basically a
publish once and it's there for ever

416
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,429
because it smeared around the world

417
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,620
I mean everybody who there's a there's a
keys are never you can participate in it

418
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,620
you can run a key server if you want to

419
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,669
requires a a couple dozen gigs have

420
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:17,059
hard drive space I'm and

421
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,149
you know it doesn't require super
powerful machine but it needs machine

422
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,659
its on the network

423
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,140
I'm and and george et updates to keys as
they come in

424
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,299
so a so k let me let me let me step back
a second

425
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:32,679
another concern that I haven't even
addressed in all of this is issues about

426
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,760
revocation and rekeying

427
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,158
and one other things that the key
service that you do is that they let you

428
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,630
actually do a reaching because you can
publish new keys

429
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,289
and that you issue revocations because
thats it is it's a canonical place

430
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:49,750
in on centralized canonical place to
publish

431
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,940
certificate revocation so when would you
want it's when would you want a

432
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,030
certificate revocation

433
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,010
compromise yep a

434
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:06,220
outdated technologies expect sir

435
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,240
expression as a matter of policy just
don't have a don't have a secret

436
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,980
distributing for too long plausible
deniability

437
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,530
who okay

438
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,960
so that just reported in here that was
plausible deniability if you revoke

439
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,090
Turkey and then continue using it anyway

440
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:29,090
have to think about that that's
interesting look going out a business

441
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,320
getting acquired

442
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,760
um axe and using a bad library to
generate a key

443
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,540
I don't have anybody here has ever done
that um

444
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:46,928
yes X Lebanon has

445
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:51,150
to certificate revocation systems in
fact neither richer actually widely used

446
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,280
their their becoming more widely used
but those are

447
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,280
I'm certificate revocation lists okay

448
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,290
so that the comment was the US military
has a certificate revocation was that is

449
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,080
so large that good most software can no
longer loaded

450
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,399
I'm so that's not very useful

451
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
AFP red

452
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,200
yup and then the other the other X 509
revocation model is

453
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,720
OCSP the online certificate status
protocol rich

454
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,690
is even less widely used in CR else and
basically amounts to you

455
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,910
a per connection checkup hey is the
certificate still valid

456
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,620
where you go back and you ask that
certificate authority I'm so it blends

457
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,340
another

458
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,909
syriza love potential problems but
anyway we get

459
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,120
we get revocations and recertification
ce expirations

460
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,200
and up to you can even update your
expiration dates for free

461
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,030
by taking advantage again I've existing
infrastructure widely deployed widely

462
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,760
used

463
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,960
not as well as open as a as the Weber
anything but

464
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,480
take the keys are never goes out there
it's functional it's going to take

465
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,480
advantage of it yes you can depending on
how you configure

466
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,559
your system's I mean the fact that the
US military's is publishing material

467
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,440
suggest there probably is policy within

468
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,290
some branches there that you have to
have your browser configured to check

469
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,909
CRN's every so often

470
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:32,500
no

471
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,950
everybody is not using CR else and if
you look at if you look at your browser

472
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,120
I don't actually think any of the
standard browsers setting answer that

473
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,230
probably get lighter

474
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:46,880
did okay one place that uses cereals a
lot

475
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,880
is digital rights management

476
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:00,409
so

477
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:03,779
got it ago so the comment was that um
was that

478
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:08,919
you the the digital rights management
companies are using CRL students we

479
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:09,759
disable

480
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,789
devices saying he here's your here's a
list of devices

481
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:16,379
you should no longer send content to you
home

482
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:19,989
so there's a place for their being used
maybe not for good

483
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:22,989
um so okay so

484
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:26,909
Creek visualization overview SSH outta
the box looks like this

485
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:31,570
um and then reuse the key server network
represented by the cloud

486
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,629
to to get a certificate from the Keyser
is no computer P certificate

487
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:39,229
in this case there's to certificates
that represents the most remote desert

488
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:39,999
fire nature

489
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:44,309
this client to decide whether they're
just certifier why or certify RSI

490
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:47,639
or neither or both to make the
certification

491
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,190
firm and then

492
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,959
here's the standard up so then here's
the use the web doing the same thing

493
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:59,119
I'm so you can it doesn't matter that
this has been certified by X

494
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,429
if all i care about. certifications by Y
and Z we can use the same model

495
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:07,039
so um so the Dover all goal is we what

496
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,469
over BP's certificates to be using as
many comics as possible

497
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:14,129
got email got SSH functioning we've got
HD PSN

498
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:18,179
in one direction folks are interested in
the other direction talk to me

499
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,509
I'm I wanna see client certificate as
well as problematic as clients difficult

500
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,029
are

501
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:27,109
especially in the face of the
renegotiation tax but we need to have

502
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:30,158
the infrastructure in place once those
fixes actually do propagate

503
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,919
and then there's other mechanisms we can
potentially start injecting assorted

504
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,269
though be too difficult in the stream
themselves that's not a band anymore

505
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,539
we don't need to do that absolutely it's
probably good idea for performance

506
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:44,549
but the point here is we can wrap this
up right

507
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,589
we can start by leaving all the bits on
the wire exactly the same

508
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:51,759
and and people can start authenticating

509
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,339
using trust models that are actually
more closely connected to the way humans

510
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,129
think

511
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:59,969
and not to these default weird business
models and then

512
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,119
and then we can also in the in the
process we can then

513
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,929
start looking at things like artsy 5081
which is open PGP keys within a TLS

514
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:08,539
session

515
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:12,908
and we can start pushing for those as
performance improvements which I do you

516
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:16,919
think we will be

517
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,159
TLS is transport layer security so HTTPS
is

518
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,089
standard-issue TP over a transport layer
security tunnel

519
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:27,759
and gentler security is the successor to
you as which have to as a cell

520
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,269
the Secure Sockets Layer which you may
or may not have heard have

521
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:35,619
but Soto TLS is a it's the name going
forward

522
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:39,579
love what we're supposed to call it
because netscape and the copyright for

523
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:43,399
SSL I think more that bad I'm sure there
are other variants that why we're

524
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,710
switching the terminologies yards but
the less as the term is this ATF

525
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:54,710
politics

526
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,879
but

527
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,920
okay sir the the question for pretty
didn't hear it was

528
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,370
um the reason that the proposals that
the reason that people aren't using

529
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,810
OpenPGP as widely is because if the
amendment of work that it takes to set

530
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,929
up your trust network

531
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,150
particularly for users who don't
understand what the word trust means

532
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:46,710
for perhaps confused by a systems that
use the word trust wrong or whatever

533
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,200
so how do you how do we propose to have
this work without

534
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,220
forcing users to go through the painful
process of setting up the trust network

535
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,730
without justice did give Tories

536
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,320
want it so there's a buncha ways to
answer that one word answers is

537
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,120
you can still trust certificate
authorities in this model if all you

538
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,040
care about is a

539
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,320
I actually do trust Verisign you can do
that and you can

540
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,120
and we can setup default trust along
those lines if we want to

541
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,330
so there's room for existence to be
there is a set themselves up

542
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,040
as OpenPGP certificate authorities
alongside their excitement on stupid

543
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,550
Tories

544
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,760
I'm another another answer is well

545
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,190
you can actually leave all the X 597
place immediately seven days

546
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,870
and we just want to provide more ways
that is useful for you to set up a trust

547
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,430
network

548
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,850
even if your initial just network is
just me and my buddy who and we each

549
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,120
have accounts on each other's SSH
servers

550
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,670
then thats you know that's a trust
network that's worthy ove

551
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,260
actually being able to authenticate in
reaching the machines so the more

552
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,990
reasons you have to build the trust
network I think the more incentive there

553
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,540
will be to the public let me just
comment very briefly that

554
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,129
we definitely do acknowledge though that
that is that's a challenge

555
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,660
I did what that's probably the biggest
impediment right now for

556
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,050
widespread use a vocal PDP in my opinion
is

557
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,100
developing these trust networks so we
need better tools

558
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,130
to make it easier for people to do that
in a way that makes sense

559
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,960
and is not stupid yeah and actually

560
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,240
if any of you guys are user interface
folks

561
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,910
who what who enjoy thinking about this
and want to help figure out how to

562
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,760
visualize it

563
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,120
I would love to talk to you about it
because

564
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,150
good key management so trust

565
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,360
and like actual trusts knowing who
someone

566
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,780
knowing who someone is in deciding
whether you think that they can

567
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,840
introduce you to pee porn you believe
them

568
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,900
that's a natural thing for humans to do
right

569
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,340
we do this all the time like I've known
this guy for a long time few tells me

570
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:41,730
that

571
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,300
you know here's here's a you know so and
so my professor

572
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,780
well you know I'm gonna believe him
because

573
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,310
I know who he is and I don't have to
arena to think about it that much

574
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,360
so would be nice to be able to take
advantage this is on the humans already

575
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,260
do really well

576
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,310
why our tool so bad doing it what we
want to do is you want to make the tools

577
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:05,659
expand what humans are already good at
doing which is a rather name on his fear

578
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,120
comes from for those who are curious

579
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:14,120
yeah

580
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:50,870
um

581
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,009
the so the question was from someone
who's working at age 53 saying hey we do

582
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:59,850
we do some legitimate verification and
does OpenPGP propose to do that

583
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,470
my answer to you is I'm very grateful to
you for doing the services that you're

584
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:03,909
doing

585
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:08,470
your verifications are very useful
however I don't necessarily need to

586
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,409
trust you

587
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:13,070
I could just somebody else to do the
same verifications and so

588
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,740
if I know you and I know that you're the
one who's actually doing certifying and

589
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,139
I know what your policies are

590
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:21,460
in your in if you if you're actually
doing good diligence

591
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,119
there's there's no reason to totally
reject these 5230 out of hand

592
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,460
however the certificate for is a
compromise ago they have

593
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,340
someone have crappy policies the ones
that have good policies the policies can

594
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,980
be broken

595
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,820
and so the same issue holes for anybody
doing any certification

596
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,549
X 509 OpenPGP whatever I want to break
the logjam

597
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:43,549
so that there isn't a cartel that
actually holds those keys

598
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:46,369
because right now it's in secure because
there's no way to get outta that cartel

599
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:46,619
that

600
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,090
everybody's just agreeing to trust this
group of corporate middleman

601
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,169
to actually make the certs so I'm not
saying

602
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:56,369
every certification made by see as bad
i'm saying

603
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,570
I don't want to have to trust this
cartel but there's also the issue of the

604
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,129
weakest link so even if one certificate
authorities doing a really good job of

605
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:03,759
checking

606
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,830
the fact that my browser automatically
truss a difference certificate authority

607
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,810
that could be doing

608
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,369
nothing or being malicious completely no
of eyes all the work that you've done

609
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:16,389
it makes a completely useless so I mean

610
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,429
I I don't know why mean again no offense
to you but

611
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,659
your business model is completely
subverted by the fact that some other

612
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,629
entity that you have no association with
at all could just be

613
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:32,759
maliciously suburban you work so I
actually would call on people who work

614
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,849
at it if the authorities

615
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:37,109
if they want to come talk to me I would
love to talk to you about

616
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:41,190
how you can issue OpenPGP certificates
alongside Rex lebanon certificates

617
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,369
I actually think that there's a a room
for some differentiation there

618
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:48,089
as a business model you can be the
certificate 30 there were issues OpenPGP

619
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:51,239
certifications as well as X 509
certifications

620
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,069
um and I be happy to talk about what the
consequences if that would be and how it

621
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:55,899
would actually be done

622
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:59,980
um I want to get through a few more
slides can you hold the questions for

623
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,950
a little bit I'm so are Creek
visualization

624
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,460
how it is now I think you guys got this
point here and how it could work with

625
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,530
the monkeys fear right

626
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,030
and a bunch of folks able to say the
same thing I'm

627
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,030
surprising potentially take observations
one is that

628
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,220
that we actually didn't need to make
changes on the wire I thought that was a

629
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
pretty nice

630
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,420
result I'm not that we can't make
changes on the wire but it's a lot

631
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,150
harder to deploy changes in the works
you have to fix both ends

632
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,589
I'm another thing is that if you look at
that time and I motto the way that the

633
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:32,980
certification is done is actually a
subset what you could do with a BGP

634
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,630
so if you really actually like the
current hierarchical model you can do it

635
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:40,980
with OpenPGP there is no there's no need
for X 509 just use OpenPGP certificates

636
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,880
to create your hierarchical structure
done and for people who don't know

637
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,680
anything about

638
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,180
OpenPGP that the analogous X 509 model

639
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,730
in OpenPGP speak is pretty absurd your
like

640
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,740
bet you have like a trust debt for like
you know

641
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,950
10 or something its ultimate owner trust
on Mike several dozen keys with

642
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,509
something that you would never ever ever
do

643
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,560
with your OpenPGP keys um and then
another interesting observations that

644
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,049
for TLS anyway this actually fixes for
HTTPS if it is though

645
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:14,579
multiple sites per IP port combination
also fixed

646
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:17,770
um with the TLS extension with which is
the server name extension

647
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,950
but turns out you can have you can have
one key

648
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,578
in OpenPGP you can not only have
multiple certifications but you can have

649
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,780
multiple user ID is attached so you
could have the one key and you could say

650
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,859
these three web sites are served by that
key

651
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,279
and then individual certifiers concert
if i won or the other

652
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,440
or all or whatever above those

653
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,030
I'd others identities and so you can
actually solve that problem this way

654
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,380
without having to have both server and
client had this on the wire change

655
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,690
love supporting server name I'm

656
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,520
so and it works today just to be clear
this is not all pie-in-the-sky stuff it

657
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,819
works with unpatched open SSH

658
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:55,990
we have a Firefox extension it works
with any TLS cable web server

659
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,880
and if you adopt it how many view here
run servers or administer servers

660
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,740
nice and how many the city services that
you administer

661
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,900
you %uh have crypto whether it's open
SSL

662
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,940
are aggressive

663
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,060
I how many hands you have her

664
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,710
um so so at you can you can

665
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,920
adopt this for your server without
sacrificing the existing users who

666
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,540
maybe can't currently there are five
things you OpenPGP you can

667
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,560
participate in this and and it without
breaking any of the existing stuff that

668
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,240
that any the existing already broken
infrastructure you can leave that broken

669
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,480
furniture and intact

670
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,190
and the folks who have to use it will
keep on using it but you can also use

671
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,250
OpenPGP so that the folks who do use
OpenPGP

672
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,780
now Jan a you can identify your services

673
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,680
so this is a quick overview for folks
who are running systems I'm

674
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,098
on the server side you install the
monkeys for package if you don't have it

675
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:54,819
installed

676
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:58,970
a and you don't it's available in Debian
and Ubuntu

677
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,069
I'm in different versions

678
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:05,180
we have FreeBSD ports unit other
assistance please

679
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,990
come you know talked was afterwards out
since all the extra baggage the monkeys

680
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,569
for host import key

681
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:14,140
here's my secret key and here's the
hostname

682
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,319
so SS not know that there's the protocol
included here so this is an asset this

683
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:18,509
is an SSH

684
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,400
G and we're importing as SSH with the
hostname and he said published news

685
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,740
okay which is now in the OpenPGP servers
its public

686
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,270
I'm however that doesn't solve the
problem because your users

687
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,310
anybody can do this and your users still
don't know that it's actually

688
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,930
big then hosted you provided and so

689
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,190
unity property yourself verify its
fingerprint of course

690
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,290
sign in and then push push your certs
back to the geezers

691
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,319
and that's it and save it works the same
way for HTTPS

692
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:52,000
so you seem to know where you're a
shitty pS It ricky is its thing that

693
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,660
says

694
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,368
begin our is a private key in the top of
the file um

695
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,960
if you know where it is I can help you
find in your server

696
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,069
so ok but yes you can do the exact same
thing that CBS

697
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:07,849
this is not a hard process to do it
doesn't change that it's on the wire at

698
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:08,349
all

699
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:11,440
and it enables a new for authentication
for users who

700
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,490
who want to use it and so again this is
what we started with this is in garbage

701
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,720
for SSH

702
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:23,040
I'm so what we should say is no

703
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,970
so here's an example convict trunk
configuration for SSH config

704
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,970
and this is the relevant that year for
any host this is that a proxy command

705
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,680
line

706
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,270
which says use the monkeys your proxy
commands to connect to the server

707
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:41,339
and then so many compliments message
conveyed

708
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:44,540
2000 and user now i connect to this
machine

709
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,880
and among his peers as up got the key
checked it out

710
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,980
its certified by somebody that you have
that you believe

711
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,420
makes reasonable certifications so many
go ahead and added to the known as far

712
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,430
I don't have to see any of the garbage
red I wasn't presented with stuff that I

713
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,480
don't understand

714
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,900
or something I don't know and then I
just have to them to get myself in

715
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,190
there you go I'm in it actually also
works in the other direction as well

716
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:11,109
word your GPG key can now be used to
connect SSH server zippers SSH servers

717
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,000
are configured

718
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,410
to authenticate users via the OpenPGP
red dress which is also functional I

719
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,779
don't have a demonstration with your

720
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,119
anyway so I'm gonna open for questions
just the point that the takeaway here is

721
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,720
that authentication is critical

722
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,589
public key authentication is really
useful in both directions

723
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:30,790
and no BGP can be used to solve you know

724
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,490
many if not most of the issues about
there's no authentication

725
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,609
and everyone getting more context so if
you've got ideas for other places it

726
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:38,420
could be used leaded

727
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:45,420
you know come talk to us

728
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,910
are a were

729
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,129
how much how do you have ok cool

730
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,720
okay um so yes I'm some questions

731
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,260
chromium a with that a question

732
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,400
um so I'm assuming the question was

733
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,730
do we have extensions for chromium the
answer is No

734
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,910
a if you're interested in working on
them we would love your help

735
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,819
um I actually don't even know what the
plugin architecture looks like for

736
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,420
chromium

737
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,900
I'm and let me also point out here that
depending on the level up the stack

738
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,380
other interested in working in

739
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,370
you could be ready extensions for web
browsers or you could also potentially

740
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,000
be writing um plugins for

741
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,580
a.m. a you writing plugins for the
crypto there

742
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,610
so there are you whether that's lib NSS

743
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:42,040
or open as a seller QTLs if we can find
ways to get plugins for those induced a

744
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,390
good indication how did

745
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,819
just the a quick plug for so when I put
up on the

746
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,850
online on the up on the screen here

747
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,830
is this is our arm our website for the
project

748
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:58,420
and its are under HTTPS are you can't
really see it it's cut off at the top

749
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,960
but if you look down at the bottom right
the

750
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,050
yeah the little monkey head is what's

751
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,980
indicating to me that you this site has
been

752
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,090
authenticated by the market's fear by a
the does or extension

753
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,150
right now because is a Firefox extension
um ended

754
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,190
it it works by if it doesn't if it can't
validate it through

755
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,990
the standard X 509 model then it goes
though did you ever trust

756
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,920
looks for the key figures out whether
the certification is valid and then goes

757
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,920
ahead with it if it actually is

758
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,410
Rep

759
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,549
so the question was there's a Web of
Trust and

760
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,180
is do you have a need for something like
a web of mistrust is their way to

761
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,770
identify when things are not

762
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,320
are not trustworthy and I think

763
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,240
that the default is that we have a
universal mistrust

764
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,390
and we are building a Web of Trust
within the universe if mister so by

765
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:10,960
default

766
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,960
things are mistrust but I'd be curious
about people say gonna

767
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:31,390
you know

768
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,080
okay so

769
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,130
so the the comment is that actually we
have all these different kinds of trust

770
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,050
in society

771
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,170
I hope I'm getting this this
characterizing accurately and that we

772
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,740
trust for instance when you go to a
restaurant we trust them not to poison

773
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,590
our food or just central authority to
make sure that they're healthy

774
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,500
I'm and that there is actually a default
level of trust that we have

775
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,910
sew them back up a second I'm the kinds
of trust that I'm talking about here

776
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,690
and the kinds of trust that are relevant
for the Web of Trust are not the kinds

777
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,810
of trust that says

778
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,910
it's okay to you at this restaurant
they're not the kind to trust that say

779
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,740
this person is a good person they're not
the kind of trust that say

780
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,720
I've known this person since I was a
child but they are

781
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,290
is I'm the trust in particular is

782
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:49,170
I trust this person to properly identify

783
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,810
other parties it's a very very narrow
definition of trust

784
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,870
and it's useful to keep it in a row
because we can actually make reasoned

785
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:57,589
inferences

786
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:01,350
if we keep in a row and we avoid
exposing to too much

787
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:05,460
if a love serve

788
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,160
eyes social graph kind of things if we
were to publish things like

789
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,319
oh yeah this restaurant is great use my
cryptographic seal of approval

790
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,480
that's a different problem I'm not
trying to address that problem with this

791
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,060
I don't think any of the folks at the
monkeys you're trying to address

792
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:26,060
issues beyond do I trust these parties
to authenticate other people

793
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:34,730
and this conference is so the comment
was we don't have a web just we tend to

794
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,970
rely on central authorities

795
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,420
and this conference is a great example
love why that doesn't actually work

796
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,880
right what we actually have as a Web of
Trust is we

797
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,880
we r from republic but but but I think
people dude people do do it I mean

798
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,220
I don't need a central authority to tell
me that this is my friend daniel

799
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,400
and I wouldn't even I mean it would be
absurd right i mean i i think pretty

800
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,710
much

801
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:05,060
everybody died in Iraq with in this room
there's no centralized authority that's

802
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,100
told me anything about any of these
people that's going to be relevant to my

803
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,360
interaction with them at all

804
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,480
the senate issued by centralizing that
sir

805
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:21,480
yes

806
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:36,570
here

807
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:50,440
there K

808
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,560
K

809
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,600
up

810
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:07,600
of

811
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,140
the the

812
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:20,069
day the K

813
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:25,720
be for solid

814
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,110
so it's all me

815
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:34,720
anyway CA of

816
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,180
in world through

817
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,370
he

818
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:49,370
use

819
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:58,019
yep not serve really really really good
question actually and that's what we

820
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:01,769
internally refer to as Marge the
marginal you why so

821
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:05,569
basically you know you don't necessarily
always have a direct

822
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:09,729
TrustPower to something right so you
wanna know in those cases well

823
00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:13,679
who who has made certifications and do
you know what r what is my relationship

824
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:14,349
to them

825
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,779
and thats that's a really hard problem
that's another thing that we've

826
00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:20,849
been working a lot on and in fact with
the

827
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:24,589
with the web stuff we don't actually
currently have a marginal you I that's

828
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:26,799
what we're working on right now but we
do have

829
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:29,869
boots boots would have a a rough
marginal you why

830
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:33,779
in in SSH so for instance if you SSH to
a server

831
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:37,599
and that the you don't have a full
TrustPower

832
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,019
to that server key what it'll show you
what you'll be shown before you get to

833
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:42,479
the

834
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:47,479
key acceptance prompt arm the list of
people who have certified to keep the

835
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:49,069
list to people who you know

836
00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:52,769
right certify that key so you know if
you if you

837
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:55,929
take my open b2b fingerprint after this
talk and then you try to connect to

838
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:57,150
server that I maintain

839
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:00,769
you have no reason to actually believe
that

840
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:05,819
to believe me when I certify say
Google's SSH services

841
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,869
but you might have risen certitude to

842
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:12,949
believe my certifications for services
that you believe I do actually control

843
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:17,689
and so there's more nuanced there then
in the traditional OpenPGP models

844
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,719
Rogers no BTU miles as I you know

845
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,439
I think this guy really doesn't issue
bad certifications I'm gonna

846
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:27,629
a minute rely on him to meet any
certification that

847
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,969
he wants and so the margin you I really
is important because it shows

848
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:34,199
it lets users I think if we can build it
properly

849
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:38,229
I think we can let users build I'm build
those

850
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:41,849
those more take be scoped delegations

851
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:48,849
love authority yeah

852
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,578
we really did he say its DP anymore we
just say

853
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:20,579
go to whatever dot com million dollars
in the city

854
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,120
Brett projects are

855
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,759
I I I completely agree with you

856
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,490
and I think the statement that I made
was probably

857
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:46,120
a.m. not as clear as it should have been
so when I said there's a universal

858
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,759
mistrust and we're building website it

859
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,220
I was your I was referring to the sort
of security mindset

860
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,820
and the way that software should be
built to act on behalf of the user

861
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,770
and I believe you are correct in that
the majority of users are actually

862
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,630
I'm not starting from that position a
distrust

863
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:06,370
me because they don't understand the
nature of the media network

864
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,410
and how many points of failure there
actually are in the communication

865
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,540
because as we brought stuff closer and
closer to the user's

866
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:17,170
the I think the result is that people
say oh well it's like i'm talking to my

867
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,260
buddy I'm on Facebook I can see their
face

868
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,700
the messages are right there how could
it not be from them and

869
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,110
we haven't done a good job explaining
how the media nature makes

870
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,740
the sort of interaction that we can have
your face to face I'm

871
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:36,740
actually illusory online

872
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,119
so

873
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,140
so you're raising a good question right
there are a lot of users

874
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,220
who don't actually know anyone who who
does

875
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,240
have the mindset love oh I'm in actually
take this stuff seriously and do the

876
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,859
right thing

877
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:10,980
with it error but there are some other
averages out imagine that

878
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,240
everybody in this room knows a user who
has the naive mine said

879
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,619
but that user also knows someone who
doesn't have a naive mindset and that

880
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:21,690
person is you

881
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:26,640
okay you guys actually understand the
situation

882
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,710
and you understand why this is something
that needs to be taken seriously

883
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,890
and I would actually consider

884
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,060
certifications many people who think
about that more important

885
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,980
and so many people do have deep France
many people do you have

886
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,290
friends you are in that position and yes
it gives us a particular

887
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:47,980
weird position of power over people who
don't have that mindset

888
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,540
but we understand if we understand the
situation we need to either

889
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,690
make sure everybody else knows about it
or

890
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,869
do the responsible thing without power
and

891
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:01,700
and or both are you for both but but
yeah I think it's us

892
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:08,700
I think we need to do it and that goes
for us is everybody

893
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:19,070
don't apologize

894
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:28,850
but there's I think there is in fact a
project that attempting to do that

895
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,920
right

896
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,780
but that's an interesting idea my my
initial gut reaction to that is though

897
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,390
that it

898
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,770
you just end up selling points you make
a market for

899
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,240
so the the proposal for folks in the
year was a good is there a way that we

900
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,130
can sort of have points assigned to
people

901
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,290
I'm so they're not let me let me try
just as when I respond to real quick

902
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:07,170
also cuz I think we're starting to run
short on time

903
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,280
there are groups that do that see a
search is a group that

904
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,050
that uses that kind of point system to
make

905
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,530
a assertive Web of Trust the trouble
with that though is that

906
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:21,270
those points are not all the same I
actually know this guy known for a long

907
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,750
time and I think %eh does a really good
job makings

908
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,050
certifications but that doesn't mean
that you should

909
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,620
not it might if you decide that it does
but you shouldn't be forced to get on

910
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,330
base so not everybody has the same

911
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,740
view of the points so I think that's the
problem with that with that plan

912
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,850
%uh the user could yes

913
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:43,420
and actually OpenPGP allows you to
assign margin on our trust

914
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,340
or full owner trust um to you are given
to you could say this is this is

915
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,250
somebody you i'd

916
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:51,500
would rely on there's and use their
certifications or

917
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,540
this is somebody art who can issue
certification and maybe I'll buy it

918
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:59,350
if it's also corroborated by somebody
else and ok BB offers that

919
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:02,529
so that's built in with the to what
we've got so I think

920
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,670
were basically other time but a couple
of quick please

921
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,980
the to things I want to point out is
that we're always looking for

922
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,290
are development help I mean with theirs
a lot

923
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,279
we have left to do i mean we could but
OpenPGP

924
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,220
in OT are we could arm you know as an
SMTP there's a there's just a lot of

925
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,090
places that

926
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,590
you know doing the you the client
authentication there's just tons of

927
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,470
stuff we could do

928
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:31,380
working on marginal you eyes on OpenPGP
you eyes in general

929
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,680
all of this stuff needs development and
arm in particular job sweet

930
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,390
we have arm essentially only one

931
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:42,810
working implementation evoking pgp right
now which is GPG

932
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:49,810
which is okay but ago

933
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,910
was a call he up

934
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:01,670
aka anyway yeah would so anyway

935
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:04,900
there's lotsa development work to do so
if anybody veteran s at all different

936
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,530
levels if you're interested in

937
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,400
you know for user-friendly front-facing
stuff if you're interested in data

938
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,329
visualization if you're interested in
crypto

939
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:15,140
if you're interested in network schemes
if you're interested in protocol

940
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:15,940
development

941
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,510
all that stuff is sorta wide open if we
if we step up to it and and take it on

942
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,809
so if you if oh yeah chromium
development for example for

943
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:28,020
so thank you guys thank you
