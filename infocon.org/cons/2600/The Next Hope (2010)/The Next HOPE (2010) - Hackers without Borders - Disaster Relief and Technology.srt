1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,020
tiny and the couple announced its first
tho

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,560
I just a reminder when you leave on the
one thing you can do

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,740
to help I everybody cause of a
conference call that conference faster

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,400

seeing lots of clipart model homes Sen

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,460
Cup something like that on going to be
asking for the help and the conference

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,779
to do things like clean up

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,660
and move chairs around I help strike the
set down stirs on

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,170
Nonna second floor and the more you can
help us out the sooner the better

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,329
be am is a volunteer-run conference we
are making money and much of it at all

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:39,280
on cell its big help when you do stuff
like that

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,829
also if you're looking at getting
anything from the 2600 store

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,680
don't wait to launch do that am sent not
even ready to go

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,769
caught without further ado the hackers
levelers hair

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,770
way

17
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,950
hi I am smoky I am with the aftershock

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,260
Action Alliance peoples of collective
and I'm

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,390
I'm going to be. I guess kinda
facilitating

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,619
this on group panel on I

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,110
hackers Without Borders going to be
talking about our

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,150
technology and a variety I love crises

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,350
and specifically how

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,610
%ah this community %ah the hacker
community can

25
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,420
I get involved so think the other
presenter

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:45,420
is coming up okay

27
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,729
my name is Dennis and where had parked
where

28
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,240
a collective the provides tools and
resources to anti-torture turn

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,930
communities

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,930
awesome member marcher collective
communications collective

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,369
I mine is Ringo

32
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,139
possible Akbar so

33
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,330
the this I'm Alanna

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,610
aftershock Action Alliance and I'm just
gonna be flipping the slights

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,610
think I need into this

36
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,510
so the starters our presentation we have
to understand that there are two

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,890
approaches and niece approaches are not
so

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,420
are complementary as they are
oppositional approaches

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,519
to crises and the one side

40
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,739
I can't see the screen somewhere
ironside

41
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,120
is the government approach to I

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,080
crises which really is

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,660
hallmark by the idea management %ah

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,859
this is actually changed job posts a

45
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,980
on post-world war two but the idea is
that the government

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,209
%ah and actually corporations and even
to a certain degree

47
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,519
I non-government organizations large
ones like Red Cross Salvation Army

48
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,970
other groups that do really are
interested in managing

49
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,980
managing resources but most importantly
managing

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,010
people doing times I love our crisis
which is different

51
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,760
then the Civil Defence idea that
government had

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,120
I going from the depression up into

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,519
World War two which was a much more
civilians involved

54
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,879
our process I and mismanagement is

55
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,950
recognizable by their I would say
paranoid

56
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,250
I desire to control information our

57
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,900
they have this desire to keep
information from

58
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,280
not only the media but from people
bought inside a crisis area

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,739
and outside of a crisis area why because
they believe

60
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,879
I information will limit their ability
to manage

61
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,069
our situation I and they want you

62
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,189
in the end these are means to an and

63
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,799
in the end is to reestablish as quickly
as possible

64
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,140
the status quo get back to what

65
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,150
was happening before the disaster book
before the civil unrest obese

66
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,560
before the crisis people like us in the
rooms

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,020
your neighbors your coworkers I a fellow
student

68
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,229
we r we organize for disasters

69
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:34,820
we find ourselves in crises I there
somehow Mark Sanders been

70
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,719
decades and decades %uh research and
what's interesting is it seems to be

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,130
cross-cultural

72
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,159
doesn't matter whether it's happening in
South Africa

73
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,070
doesn't matter whether staff and China
or here in New York

74
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,300
the first thing that happens is it's
recognizable

75
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,340
by mutual aid make sense you helping out
your neighbor

76
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,060
ya there's a fire may be four you get
together try to put out fire

77
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,030
I its mutual aid there's not I cash
exchange going on no one

78
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,539
no one is porn AT&T Inc you put out the
fire

79
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:09,960
you know what we're coming together I'll
and the first thing you find out is

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,400
there's

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,340
a thirst for information and people are
sharing information

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,320
now if they don't have good information
that doesn't mean to sharing stops

83
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,990
share rumors the shirt gossip I'll
people are

84
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,460
what's going on the first question did
you hear

85
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,680
axe do you know if the roads are safe to
go down

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,750
and itself organized I

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,940
it's not that people planned way ahead
of time

88
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,860
in case in this scenario you're going to
be the captain obvious the lieutenant

89
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,789
and Dennis will be in charge of
sanitation doesn't work that way

90
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,190
ordered that somebody comes in and says
is what you gonna do it yourself

91
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,090
organizes

92
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,210
that doesn't mean specialization doesn't
occur there may be a group of us will

93
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,219
decide that

94
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,750
I we will be two people to go out and
check on the older people

95
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,830
and maybe some missus hey I I'm a nurse

96
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,659
I can set up a first aid station so
doesn't mean a specialization doesn't

97
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,150
occur

98
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,630
or that role stone appear just simply
means that is organized

99
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,710
by the group on the fly on this is a

100
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,520
out these are the group in charge of
managing a crisis

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,359
the Emergency Alert System EAS be the
emergency broadcasting system

102
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,550
is to make that and knowing tone I'll

103
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,220
FEMA of course everybody's familiar with
and Department of Homeland Security

104
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,199
who kinda oversees all that stir fry to
give local and state

105
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,110
groups are also involved but if you look
at here this is on the first page

106
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,350
up the FEMA 2004 policy

107
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,660
explaining how the EA ask emergency
alert system is supposed to work

108
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,729
the primary function of the emergency
alert system

109
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:52,590
it's the support the continuance
government or talk

110
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,780
all information must be managed K

111
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,060
on this was in a this on the first page
you're not trying to hide this you don't

112
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,630
need to go to weekly lakes

113
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,240
to find this you just need to go to the
fam a page are and

114
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,780
we're gonna see me more of this kind of
approach what happens

115
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,130
when they manage information well this
is %ah

116
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,460
wit man who was in charge Rd
environmental of protection

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,770
I A agency during 9/11 you can see the
date there's 912

118
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,909
and she comes out and says air quality
is entirely safe

119
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,330
ac Ground Zero today know that it was
safe

120
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,120
now in fact they had plenty of reason to
believe that was not say

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,150
actually have run scenarios ahead of
time

122
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,150
looking at what would be the pollution
if I the World Trade Center would come

123
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,690
down

124
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,289
because in the very first bombing camp
so they already had this

125
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:50,949
so they lied straight up they managed
information because it serve their needs

126
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,889
and in on the side there you could see
that the information was

127
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,789
patently false and it it lead to serious
health

128
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,860
I'll issues with people nm probably
deaths and there are

129
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,069
how well as countless lawsuits going on
right now

130
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,849
not only that but they actually passed a
resolution to prohibit people from doing

131
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,280
taking their on air quality samples
right now it's

132
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,060
illegal to have a Geiger counter I'll in
New York

133
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,030
passed by legislators why because
information is me manage why should you

134
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,580
know

135
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,859
a dirty bomb has gone off and Time
Square yet the authorities

136
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,130
will let you know when you when you need
to worry

137
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,070
I this another classic one after
Hurricane Katrina

138
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,440
on this was sent out it was actually
helicopters and stuff

139
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,099
picking people up flying around with
this recorded message

140
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,040
how did that recorded messages there's
food medical care transportation at the

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,540
Superdome

142
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,430
that that just wasn't true they knew it
wasn't a case of

143
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,050
I'll is there isn't because there had a
base their

144
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,349
they were waiting for these people to
come so they were sending people

145
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,290
I'll where there wasn't either food
medical care and force transportation

146
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,540
come weeks later

147
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,410
and we all got to see it on our TV
screens on the right here is just some

148
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,569
you know statistics and I'll

149
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,220
this a little quote on the side we have
food for security only

150
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,399
I was actually broadcast when confronted
by a local

151
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,339
ABC reporter is like how condition of
food here we have to wear

152
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,990
where is it its only force the security

153
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,910
this goes back a little bit further 1906
the San Francisco

154
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,699
on the scanner I think captures the
mindset that really hasn't changed much

155
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,390
about people are that are in charge of
managing disasters

156
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,310
volunteers are the problem this is for
professionals travel may help each other

157
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,230
out

158
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,470
but it is anarchy this was our general
greeley

159
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,450
I who this person that after the
earthquake lead to poor neighborhoods

160
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,240
turn to create brand breaks and and when
that didn't work

161
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,010
actually unleashed artillery into
neighborhoods

162
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,390
and eventually knocked out this very
well functioning

163
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,550
tent city I which you see the
photographs there that light

164
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,579
writers wrote about so I mean this is
the

165
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,600
this is the approach %ah that

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,680
government had tanker train of course
was famous

167
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,000
that the National Guard stacked Red
Cross trucks

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,709
stop individual group that we're trying
to bring aid

169
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:30,709
and kept them out in the city because
the city was not yet managed

170
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,660
once the city was managed then

171
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,060
civilian aid could come in that was
that's the idea

172
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,220
that thinking are behind %ah these kind
of approaches

173
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,060
so it's very understandable I but it may
not actually

174
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,269
be our agenda ask people who can suffer
from these

175
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:54,910
disasters soweto bad news right

176
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,860
at all that good you know your limits
your leaders

177
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,910
can't save you but they can get you
killed is kinda

178
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,260
shorthand message if that which is

179
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,910
not very uplifting rank our Katrina
Haiti

180
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,829
I so on and so forth show us time and
time again I'll that

181
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:16,230
the government's attempts at management
really turn out to be

182
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,260
%ah exercises and mismanagement
mismanagement

183
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,319
however that being said I the Chinese
character for

184
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,910
odd crisis or disaster we just

185
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,089
is actually made a I have two characters
I

186
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,829
which is danger our time danger in a
time opportunity

187
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:38,680
and I think that's what we wanna talk
about here how can we make

188
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,089
that happen how can we get mutual aid

189
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,940
self-organization and revision and
resist

190
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,019
returning back to the status quo I

191
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,560
how can we do that and I believe in
talking and

192
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,149
talking with many disaster people people
lifter disasters we've

193
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,550
we've gone to Katrina people found the
Haiti from our group

194
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,779
you know a lot about this stuff we've
been studying for years it seems that

195
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:03,550
the key

196
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,860
always is information and that's why
we're here and help

197
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,790
that's why we're here talking about as
you guys like it or not

198
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,980
are the non-governmental experts

199
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,750
how to get information to people

200
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,120
cell but you're not the first people to
do that

201
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,230
I parent radios I have been used in
crises

202
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,230
I going way back to been used to protest
disasters

203
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,490
civil unrest and I was in earlier for my
wireless

204
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,579
communication that had some advantages
the first one

205
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,110
I she ever gonna kinda flip through
these is out

206
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,860
DJ rabbit who was the made a movie good
morning Vietnam

207
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,019
but it was really a pirate radio station
I

208
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,720
and vietnam and the quote is from a
brigadier general

209
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,410
was talking about rabbit before you
before they figured out who he was

210
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,420
I that it had a huge impact

211
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,519
and creating I am

212
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,459
protests and things like that I thought
because all the stuff we've been talking

213
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:08,899
about WikiLeaks

214
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,510
it's kind of like the WikiLeaks up
before there was

215
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,529
internet and personal computers but
nobody

216
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,370
squeal him a now Indian

217
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,529
J already allow us in Italy

218
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,139
%uh was I think wanted to bury early
uses

219
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,829
wireless technology to help income notes
self-organization

220
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:36,190
I course the I leader to Caltrain which
is their equipment

221
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,000
FBI and state police put it together saw
them as

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,750
the kinda that they couldn't control the
streets to the two

223
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,459
radio Alice the air which was the legal
actually at the time

224
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,970
because they were different radio loss
in Italy but it took it off is run by a

225
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,410
bunch of anarchists

226
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,660
I but they were very important radio
house was impact not only

227
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,760
leading up to the protests crisis

228
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,120
but to resisting the manager providing
self-organization

229
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,779
living people now me that matter where
you are politically

230
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,350
letting people know what was going on in
the streets because there was a media

231
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,610
blackout

232
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,070
okay so again you have to government
trying to control information

233
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,260
who there's a crisis as much people
protesting

234
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,149
we're going to keep all the journalists
away there's protesters are trying to

235
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:22,769
figure out

236
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,149
what's going on you know where where
they can go and things like that and

237
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,990
then you have average people to

238
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,579
who 10 hey I have to go to work today or
is everything shut down because

239
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,970
general strike the only place people
could get that information was radio

240
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,389
house

241
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,440
became hugely popular %ah

242
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,589
all source people or listen to it and
became a threat on the monopoly

243
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,240
flaw information

244
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,279
I i helped I found group called the

245
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
Emergency Broadcast System

246
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,990
Emergency Broadcast System I'll
self-organization

247
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,940
I and in our mission statement was
People to People information

248
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,110
unmitigated an unscented very similar to
you know

249
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,250
week leaks and things like that except
for we were trying to provide

250
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,010
information from people to people like
Katrina

251
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,380
and how we did this was true mutual aid

252
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,310
and self-organization I'll we week liked
it

253
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,490
albright chief communication tools that
were non-existent

254
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,990
I after the hurricane to bring them down
and

255
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,130
two major ones were real radio station

256
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,110
pirate radio station which was donated
up in Urbana

257
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,820
Illinois and other people gave us solar

258
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,269
up power generator we had expert

259
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:45,370
and get people from about seven
different states

260
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,649
never knew each other got involved work
together

261
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,959
brought down a pirate radio station why

262
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,649
we have no idea why that was in our job
we are trying to manage

263
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,339
the crisis we knew people wanted
information once we got down there was a

264
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,190
mess Native American tribe that

265
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,649
we lost sixty percent of our people we
don't know where the rest for people our

266
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,339
and because we are recognized %ah tribal

267
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,420
you I government we can't get any FEMA
help

268
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,959
or anything like that we want to pull
our tribe back together

269
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,870
and we don't know how to commit we used
to have a radio station get destroyed

270
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,600
he said here will set up this radio
station and they were able to pull back

271
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,560
to try to rebuild

272
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,310
we don't have that in mind okay the idea
was that

273
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,870
we just brought down the tool to let
them use it

274
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,990
the other thing we did is %ah crag

275
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,070
I person donated 5

276
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,639
I'll satellite phones because there is
no phone

277
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,190
communication coming out Katrina
families were disrupted

278
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,170
people have been said they were going to
be bus which upset distal ticket awesome

279
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,250
but then we'll take you to Nebraska

280
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,329
you know and people lost families in
people

281
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:59,329
they still hadn't counted never got an
account dead yet

282
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,519
are so was incredibly complicated
situations without power

283
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,669
well bring on phones and let people when
enough people would use them

284
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,900
we didn't really have a plan and we just
started

285
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
drive around set up a lil stations

286
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,799
people could use the found and hundreds
hundreds of people lined up

287
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,799
and now a it wasn't a great system
because the battery run out

288
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,720
convicting Eli to Joes all we had was
solar

289
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,410
generator and delight and mm by 1.1 the
people I was organizing called me back

290
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,440
in New York's and a harried

291
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,520
because there's 100 people sitting here
in the 100 degree weather

292
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,929
way to make a five minute phone call you
know how she organizes

293
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,500
ask them with them organized were just
there to get them to do and they did

294
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,740
they figured out ways

295
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,289
and we can try to control the
communication we didn't say

296
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:55,660
here we need to make calls to this
person or

297
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,539
or that her sanity or call the media
some called a meeting and said hey this

298
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,650
is what's going on and on

299
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,030
somehow the grandmother said hey you
know which dole I

300
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,139
you know that is the kind of tools that
we were looking

301
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,179
to build which were totally not managed

302
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:14,809
but up flexible and allowed in promoted

303
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,399
self-organization should know that on
the National Guard

304
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,059
and the FEMA officials attempted at
every time to stop us from doing that

305
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,250
and when this little mobile satellite
phone thing

306
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,210
came up the red cross at all that would
be great why don't you bring it to the

307
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,960
Superdome

308
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,610
people can call people now and when they
showed up there

309
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,280
I they were turned away said there was
no need for

310
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,580
that help and they were not allowed to
provide

311
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,149
something as simple something we take
for granted every day and talks taken

312
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,210
away from us

313
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,850
been able to communicate back and forth

314
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,059
farms I which leads us phone phreaks

315
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,370
I ham radio people pushing phone calls

316
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,070
squad for gates I phones are far

317
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,139
Wireless kinda form of communication and
the out

318
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,330
the thing on the left I is a

319
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,289
Aires 10 I areas is a ham radio I know
they're doing there

320
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:14,860
amateur radio license earlier this
afternoon

321
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,010
%ah this is very important there's
technology to allow you

322
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,850
basically like Skype object over amateur
radio

323
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,700
in that may be a way to avoid the
satellite phone issue which

324
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,270
it up a lot of power and also they're
like fifteen thousand dollars

325
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,500
piece a very expensive arm and

326
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,320
they've been used iPhone feature
actually I put them in there because I

327
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,809
found this interesting thing

328
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:41,970
Buffon friction England I'll

329
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,320
that got around there were some protests
I in the

330
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,470
actually I late seventies in China

331
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,309
on the workgroup protesting dissidents
and

332
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,980
they were hauling now to different
emphases

333
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,789
media outlets for whatever and in de el

334
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,990
the Chinese government in that province
just basically cut off

335
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,659
communication using switches after phone
phreaks

336
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:13,669
and England were able to us somehow
getting their internal back on

337
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:18,120
and a they Chinese government so
confident that the internet often a

338
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,220
monitor

339
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,950
for their are trying to figure out where
where these phone calls gush some I just

340
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,280
someone they flipped up to switch lock
the door and went home and somebody else

341
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,240
came in and turned on the switch in

342
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,500
for them was so that was X the squad for
gage was even a simpler form this was

343
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,070
mostly and Germany

344
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,730
Amsterdam our have huge scratch social
centres everything from daycare

345
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,770
to group planning protests what not and
he had it and have can square right here

346
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,139
in

347
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,159
on New York strong squad a tradition
nets the pictures actually front

348
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,470
I'll is day use the phone tree

349
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,789
you know the Castle County victim throw
them out

350
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,629
and they would start to they would each
have a listed phone numbers and name

351
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,830
calling and people

352
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,889
that wanted to come out onto the street
simple

353
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,210
use of communication now with the
internet of course

354
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,080
I we have a variety of other ways to
communicate adept at very effective

355
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,639
but don't disasters protests any tax
crisis

356
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,980
any time when the government crisis is
just something the government wants to

357
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,049
manage

358
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:26,360
on big because it either its causing
some kind of disruption

359
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,850
and in the media is I came outta

360
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,990
really the Seattle WTR protests and and
1999

361
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:39,309
and what impact technology was really
some in the first technology that was

362
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,520
regularly available to average people I
know people I created this

363
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,600
this stuff before but this is the first
time I was widely

364
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,980
use you had more ships and in the media
and CNN

365
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,669
ABC and NBC put together and their
website at the time

366
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,070
and what what what was different about
it anybody could post

367
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,120
I could say this is what's happening on
the street

368
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,419
I just got your gas I don't have to be a
journalist I don't have to be anybody

369
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:08,710
I'm just there and I'm just
communicating to rest

370
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,080
world I'll weaker pedia has been very

371
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,120
centrist and again this kind of
technology to get use

372
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,210
for other reasons because people are
innovative and flexible

373
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,549
you know during Katrina and earning I

374
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,299
the our earthquakes in Chile and Haiti
and stuff like that

375
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,070
week a pina ended up becoming a place
for people to give reports about what's

376
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,020
going on

377
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,820
in close to real time and even putting
like hi this is holly madison

378
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm still life heating up sabi people
would check

379
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,559
this week it is a fact now week has
created a whole different site

380
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,270
Jess for up to be used during disasters
in crisis because they know that

381
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,668
what people will do and then of course
there's blocks 144 blogs

382
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:57,340
about haiti shots now now we have to
rise the blog

383
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,418
I thing I'm most interested in

384
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,390
probably and I think I most people think
ima crisis and

385
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,780
tech technologies that I'm most
interested in the people

386
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,960
and the crisis and problem there is
often

387
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,640
I whether you're in a protest are
whether you're

388
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,250
trying to pick your way through
hurricane I'll and I can have your

389
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,150
laptop

390
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,610
are your desktop for your office
computer but a lot of people do have

391
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,799
these things attached to them all the
time

392
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,990
which cell phone so SMS and texting

393
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,770
and that the top picture is a picture of
a flash mob

394
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,530
I wasn't done in germany to protest to
warn action in Afghanistan

395
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,559
I where they got a bunch people to go
together

396
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,690
and then the text everybody lay down
once they hit

397
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,460
massive been laid down tricked people
train station which

398
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,710
desert ackerson all these people just
flop down

399
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,620
are the bottom picture is neighborhood
medics

400
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,520
its job they've done in iraq does
pictures from Palestine

401
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,379
and what this was is an idea that I
maybe attack

402
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,590
or by or something like that
infrastructure so destroyed

403
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,809
are ambulances I roads would be
destroyed to handle on ambulances

404
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:17,080
so they came up with this really
ingenious idea that will just send out

405
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,960
attacks

406
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,860
we need a doctor and such and such as
such and such streak

407
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,299
and then if our doctor nurse I wouldn't
expect I'm only two blacks

408
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,639
and that is how they we're doing medical
care and again this is kind of like

409
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,100
obviously SMS and text these people
develop this never had a plan for that

410
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,669
to be used here's another up

411
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:44,610
piece of texting imagine a way for
people all over the world to tell the

412
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,659
story of what was happening to them

413
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:51,020
all around them during a disaster or
emergency situation

414
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,090
it would need to be easy to use looking
at almost anybody can do

415
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,120
and it would need to be good playable
worldwide and that's why we've created

416
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,700
shahidi shahidi it this way anyway

417
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,140
meaning testimony witness one from the
post

418
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,240
so every everybody here knows our

419
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,130
raise your hand dime be able actually
see it if you've heard

420
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,760
shahidi looks like some have

421
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,830
sis I neat little program was from the
violence in Kenya elections I think 2000

422
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,510
8 and people

423
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,789
we're going to go to vote but they were
certain polling places

424
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:34,950
that work just panel dangerous to go
sucks on either side

425
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,350
with right knee or kill you and there
were fires and things like that

426
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,970
and so day this one was blogging about
it

427
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,580
from Kenya trying to get on information
one point she asked

428
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,029
I need to be able to do this on the cell
phone need to be able to get to self

429
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:56,090
can some people help making some
programmers and in less than 72 hours

430
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,240
they created this platform is open
source platform

431
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,400
wish shahidi

432
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,059
haha platform that would send text
alerts

433
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:10,440
to average people same this polling
place is bad

434
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,440
don't go there God this one instead if
you wanna and it was very effective in

435
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,250
reducing the number of death

436
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,700
I sent that time because it was open
source it's been used

437
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,880
all over the place not just for
disasters but also first

438
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
things like the swine flu an AV & Flu

439
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,370
epidemics and they were able to map it
and it because it's open source

440
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,539
created other applications like us which
router

441
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,110
and things like that to improve the
service

442
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,510
something that I what's interesting that
was up to source in the government had

443
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,419
the wrong kind

444
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,809
version a bit State Department on

445
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:50,350
which is nobody knows about because it
doesn't work from

446
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,380
I work so that all good news right so
you give people some information

447
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,140
give them a little better tools make a
flexible enough they can help each other

448
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,620
out

449
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,250
you can share information you can come
up with creative needs

450
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,760
I there and meet their needs creatively
and

451
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,900
this happens naturally unfortunately

452
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,549
when you tried to do this are sometimes
Empire Strikes Back

453
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,779
I there's a lot up in a lot of desire

454
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:23,370
art the state corporations to manage
these things

455
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,309
to manage people and that is their
agenda and they're very clear you can

456
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,678
read the papers you can see it's very
clear

457
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,820
and I and that's not just our country

458
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,490
is a lot of countries Mottola I'll they
made

459
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,659
using Twitter illegal I'll straight up

460
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,029
no matter what you twittering you know
whatever you wanted to try to make it

461
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,000
illegal

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,350
I Pittsburgh I'll which I have some
familiarity with

463
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:55,110
since I was a rested eyelets codefendant
and Pittsburgh for

464
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,710
allegedly sending out a Twitter messages
rebroadcast in army treating

465
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,230
our message is coming from the street up

466
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,659
during the g20 up protests in Pittsburgh

467
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:10,919
on there's some talk that you're going
to try to do that to some folks also

468
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,429
in Canada and of course we can leaks
right

469
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:17,649
the most famous I so we see that there's
this kinda

470
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:21,149
%ah this desire to manage I

471
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:24,230
but it's also hypocritical because
during Iranian

472
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,130
protests I you'll you'll see a a
different view

473
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:35,130
up social networking maybe

474
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:42,510
E

475
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,870
as Twitter become CNN on the masses well
as a combination of Internet sources

476
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,580
clearly Twitter it stands out as one of
the primary way some people are getting

477
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,250
the message from the street uses

478
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,130
compete track where the damage of and
one going off

479
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,470
and then George W Bush in deputy
national security adviser

480
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,670
mark finely the real winners in S&M
people have gotten the message out

481
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,130
even though the US with some exceptions
has been fairly quiet

482
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,750
has been the Twitter on has been
Facebook

483
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,770
Flickr you too all those if there's
anybody that should

484
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,910
possibly get a Nobel Peace Prize in the
next time around should be the founders

485
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,410
Twitter

486
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:30,820
who delayed their tuning up with their
system in order for an amazing amount of

487
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,950
tweaks to be sent down to the last week
or so

488
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,800
Twitter revolution and I got the
attention at the pentagon the US

489
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,060
military may not fully understand

490
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,460
social networking but they are using
that to think very differently

491
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,650
about the world Twitter was so important
the US State Department actually ask the

492
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,170
website to put off schedule computer
maintenance

493
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,780
should take into consideration that
Twitter actually agreed to shut down

494
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,820
scheduled maintenance the other day
because at the US State Department

495
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,770
requested that to happen Picasa such a
crucial tool

496
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,150
using sweeter you too texting show

497
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,540
from videos any chichi media they can to
Michael I

498
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,629
and tell the world what's happening in
their country

499
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,840
it's a communications revolution with
clinical implications for repressive

500
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,510
governments

501
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,550
trying to control the Internet and
social networking

502
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,940
well can the FBI has raided an apartment
in Queens New York belonged to a man

503
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,290
named kelly et Madison this after

504
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:31,649
police arrested madsen here for using
the social networking site Twitter

505
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,020
to communicate police actions two
protesters

506
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,320
over the weekend a planned upgrade
Twitter was even

507
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,110
boned in the interests of democracy what
Iranian

508
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:47,000
now the activist short using some social
networking website

509
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,550
festers with getting rounded up by
police

510
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:54,680
this is about the getting their voices a
chance to be heard

511
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,450
for immediately dispatched

512
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,270
when police confronted protesters in
Lawrenceville on the first day in the

513
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,410
money

514
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,809
any non we'll limit

515
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:11,489
swatch drugs in OC again saying the
freemen many

516
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:16,149
today Romney telling them where the
police work

517
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:20,559
out boyz ft then it was coming from a
man named Billy and Mandy

518
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,320
Queens New York without Facebook and you
get the idea of the kind of hypocrisy

519
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,279
victory %ah

520
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:34,749
I should say to

521
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:38,739
I that the did the raid was just to give
you an idea

522
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:42,830
this is not just some low call police
kind of thing that's

523
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,989
I I home I and I say our home because
there is a number of people living there

524
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:54,460
bunch animals also I am our home was
raided by the joint terrorist task force

525
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,869
I was rated for

526
00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:02,019
16 hours and I we are still possibly
under grand jury

527
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:05,440
investigation though we were never
indicted

528
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,450
for any any crime the day still possess
all

529
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,480
are computers and cellphones things like
that apparently all because

530
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,359
this kind of activity that was two
months earlier praised by the

531
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:25,179
you know the Iranian protesters for
doing this regardless is an example of

532
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:26,220
crisis

533
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,340
that their seeking to manage whether to
weathers the government of Moldova

534
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,419
or the government in the US mean this
should not be news to you that

535
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,730
repressive regimes

536
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,730
want to manage information at all costs
so now I'm gonna turn it

537
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,559
over to hack black people on there going
to talk about some ways that they're

538
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,970
working to get around us

539
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:54,970
hi

540
00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:00,460
but got together while back

541
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,639
and develop this piece of torque on tap
it here

542
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,169
is being developed right around the same
time he was coming out

543
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:11,700
there there's some unique requirements
when you're developing

544
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,269
a project not in a corporate environment

545
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:21,009
and there's there's some expectations so
you can take for granted

546
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:24,859
for example 0 development budget this is
often

547
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:28,659
this has been my experience and see
after you can have to figure out a way

548
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:29,399
to

549
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:32,869
keep the code coming and pay rent at the
same time

550
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:35,999
another requirement for the project was
to dispatch information to people

551
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:36,970
requiring

552
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,519
0 budget for the end users as well
meaning that you know like ham

553
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,039
ham radios or other typos

554
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,440
shortwave phones radios would be
prohibitively expensive

555
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,960
there was a requirement that it would be
very easy for people to get this message

556
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,980
without having to

557
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,749
fork over London money also there is a
requirement that there was a a creditor

558
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:03,970
interface like akhri review update
delete its common with many

559
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,200
blocks and

560
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,699
this way it provided for an environment
where

561
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,520
team operators could sit and collect
information from people

562
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,139
out in the field out on the streets
review it for accuracy and so on

563
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,540
vote on it categorize it possibly and

564
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,529
and then finally send it out to people
who are interested in specific types of

565
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,309
information

566
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:31,139
as many information to come in during a
big mobilization

567
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,240
you may not be interested in our you may
only be interested in Mike

568
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,200
when am I getting fed or where are the
police

569
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,149
or what was happening in this section
the city so or

570
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,388
our medics may be interested in where
are people hurt and need help

571
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,200
and in there was another something
actually to that like

572
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,829
and so we a as a result of this we ended
up deciding on Twitter on the back end

573
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:55,869
because it provides a nice

574
00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:00,630
API to SMS interface which wasn't really
available in

575
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,540
other applications like identical
provides

576
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,549
and a similar micro-blogging interface
but it doesn't have

577
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:11,690
built out SMS pack so we decided to use
Twitter

578
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,430
am but wanted the situations were was
that we knew that there was gonna have

579
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,690
to be a lot of requirements

580
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,280
a people had heard of Twitter like they
had never used a bit so contacts and

581
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,750
maybe

582
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,040
concepts that may be familiar to people
like direct messaging or

583
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,509
using at and net username to get
messages

584
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,200
visible to people are necessarily going
to be intuitive

585
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,940
and people are gonna have difficulties
with things like using

586
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,869
underscores so you know like you have
it's important to

587
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,299
like not make assumptions other people's
techies is so

588
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:46,750
we had this assumption that they won
they won't necessarily know how to use

589
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,559
it things

590
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,920
am Tapatio is probably gonna be around
for a little bit longer but as

591
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,790
propaganda phase out in support

592
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,950
day sheehy project because there's
already there's already support for

593
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,990
Android iPhone j2me devices on

594
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,000
on handsets for collecting and
dispatching

595
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,680
not just text information a graphical
information where things are happening

596
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,730
you can find out more about that 0 and
the Tapatio it's a Drupal module runs on

597
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,809
Drupal because

598
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:16,900
Hyderabad already provided like the
basis for a crowd interface in a lot a

599
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,829
way to authenticate

600
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:23,349
operators and stuff like this shortened
our development

601
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,500
skunks are awesome next on

602
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,819
so I have some reflections on
deployments and

603
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:35,319
and developing in this the scenarios and
if you have

604
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:39,450
experience developing for a company that
has

605
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,680
a development company may have some of
these ideas are ready

606
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,669
grand on you on but if not they can be
hard to learn

607
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,670
and you you can end up learning them by

608
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,020
providing services are tools that
ultimately can be used because as a

609
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,279
failure along the way

610
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,390
and and oftentimes and development
there's an as

611
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,598
some developers are here may know you
know you're gonna be testing yourself as

612
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,450
you're writing the code

613
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,630
bugs are going to come up with any
deployed application next thing you know

614
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,640
like everything gone

615
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,500
goes down nobody's service so it was
really important that we didn't have any

616
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,220
single point of failure

617
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,859
or sparks am centralization is really
bad

618
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,630
especially and an and other situation
with developing these types of software

619
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,230
is especially with the security concerns
your security is not always the same you

620
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,890
may not be worried about like

621
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:31,020
hackers and Bart attacking your net
you're specifically worried about on

622
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,099
organizations and institutions I have
lots of money

623
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,510
they have a political system they have a
legal system they have guns

624
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,390
and their their authorized to use
whatever force they need to

625
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,520
at times to stop what you're doing so
centralization in this case

626
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,369
if somebody finds out if your servers
find out where it is

627
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:52,930
they can just come in and shut it down
and communications go down that's bad

628
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,118
you don't want that to happen mutual aid
is

629
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:59,359
is something that can be really helpful
and this goes into like not redesigning

630
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,430
the wheel

631
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,279
using year leveraging other people's
tools & building a relationship with in

632
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:06,790
their development communities

633
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,960
%uh submitting bugs to them to their
projects

634
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,990
and letting them know about what you're
doing with their tools will be really

635
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:13,760
helpful

636
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,160
when you run into a situation when you
start finding bugs at the last minute

637
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,680
and you need help

638
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,879
if you build this relationship ahead of
time on the people that you're working

639
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,260
with

640
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,609
will be more likely to come back in and
help you and help you find a bug

641
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:28,828
having a test a test love the
application at a time

642
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:32,089
plan ahead as much as you can

643
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:36,480
security security should be designed to
protect our USERs

644
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,089
don't invite snitches it's your space
this can be easier said than done

645
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:45,069
by am and you know you can set up
security policies and

646
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:48,119
the people that you're working with may
already have security policies

647
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,140
and not knowing with those policies are
and

648
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,750
if you have a secure space keeping that
space safe you know it down and bite

649
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,069
somebody into your space to help out
with the ham radio who is like

650
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,779
never set anything up was later gonna
turn over the whole ham radio operation

651
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:03,559
over to the feds

652
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:06,750
ham radios maybe a little bit outdated
anymore and see any reason why we should

653
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,230
still be

654
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:11,010
her low-power FM radio for pirate radio
stations

655
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,040
nobody really has an FM transmitter
which is unfortunate but

656
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,160
actually these can be really useful in
other situations like quit smoking was

657
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,368
talking about crisis situations I guess
it really depends on your deployment

658
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:24,740
anyways daunted by stijn project
managers are awesome

659
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,010
we had a great project manager in the
development

660
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,390
Tapatio impact sure made

661
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,730
just left his great project manager
helps out especially if there's not many

662
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,279
developers helping you out to have
somebody to

663
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:41,740
back ideas of love now as you're
developing in to make sure that like all

664
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,150
the project requirements are getting
done on time

665
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,650
secure remote access there may be
situations and deployments where

666
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,060
you need to use send physical computers
for deployment you may not be like the

667
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,560
on-site sysadmin

668
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,810
for one of these applications and you
may need to send boxes into

669
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,869
hostile environment where police are
confiscating things taking hard drives

670
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:06,960
and so forth and hand having and so
making sure the useful disk encryption

671
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,140
and how clockers has a number of tools
which will make sure that go up

672
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,450
on a notes that I guess I can be
downloaded from

673
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,270
are available from hope website day when
you deploy the site

674
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:22,400
day on that person who receives it when
it had the password for our

675
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,369
ID cooking the drive between 12 comes
online it will call back into it or

676
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:27,440
service

677
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,920
and set up a remote shell on year on
your control server

678
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,180
as some other techniques actually aren't
even used in Patna to know if anybody

679
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,060
want to the crime

680
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,990
presentations you know secure ways to
get out and not disclose the information

681
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,549
where the the controlled commanders next

682
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:47,099
action journey to I like this next

683
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,359
am so the March Hare communications
collective is

684
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:54,990
collective that is hoping to provide
communications tools

685
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,259
on too radical communities and

686
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:02,440
not just around for communities but did
possibly also be able to use and other

687
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,670
times of crisis

688
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,900
right now it's gonna be built on shahidi
swift River

689
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,829
which smoking mention part of the Kapiti
a project was collecting

690
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:14,869
and information from Twitter

691
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,290
from people who had subscribe to certain
fields and using

692
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,480
and trying to do our own type of crowd
sourcing as well

693
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,710
like to get information for people who
were posting information

694
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,470
but swift River day Dave built in a
bunch of the day I they have a

695
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,660
a much larger developer base so we'll be
using that customizing

696
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,879
and those tools and like I said there's
already I'm support for

697
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,089
clients on smartphones in and and
granted

698
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:44,200
smartphones aren't super accessible now
because at the price but

699
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,420
I think we'll see their as we go into
the future that the prices are gonna

700
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,589
drop in almost all phones now supports a
to me

701
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:53,810
anyways and that is kinda available for
those funds

702
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,099
more information about March aircon
behind a marcher died or

703
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:01,099
and we're looking for help and Mike
there's all sorts of ways you can help

704
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,009
you don't have to be

705
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:05,049
sysadmin you don't have to be a
developer I'm hatin

706
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:08,299
maybe you can install an application on
your phone maybe you can install

707
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:12,400
a and instanceof are customized a
software that we're gonna be running on

708
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,290
your computer and give us bug reports

709
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,349
bug reports are awesome patches are even
better on

710
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:20,759
also like I'm not very good at graphic
designer

711
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:24,069
outreach maybe you wanna be a
cheerleader for the project would be

712
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:25,430
creative

713
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,828
need help writing docs general tech
support maybe you're like

714
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:33,540
a very specialized developer you know a
lot about up some specific technology

715
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,240
and maybe you could get in touch with me
afterwards and you can be like a I know

716
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,579
about this technology

717
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:40,480
if you need help getting up and running
the seems like something you might want

718
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,180
to be using

719
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,190
you can talk to me and I'll an offer
support

720
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,890
next patch if

721
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:56,890
but I have

722
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,740
I'm so going on here we are at Peytons

723
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,740
I am he commented on his talk by talking
about I'm going back

724
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,990
giving back to the community here in
getting involved and when I can talk

725
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,880
about

726
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,190
how hacker ethic plays in the way we
relate to each other I'm

727
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,880
as a hacker community I how would you
consider

728
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,579
your I'm 0 cancers after the labels
hackers I'm

729
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:26,690
normalcy no hands

730
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,910
a few I'm and how do you consider
ourselves to be

731
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:35,589
to attack as a hobby to you how many you
make mad bank doing hacking

732
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:39,190
fan and

733
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,270
so the top is into me is

734
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,060
something it's fun it's like active you
do like my passport where you might on

735
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,220
your tinker with things that to me as a
hobby and I think

736
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,580
hobby is amiss is a tendency to make
obvious on

737
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,660
I'm completely isolated from everything
else is going on in the world

738
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,029
I'm having a really good example this is
burning man for you have

739
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,680
as and when you're gonna bring alright
cool

740
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,279
and bring mansoor a festival event was
at the desert then you know

741
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,950
drive hundreds of miles on it take bikes
are crazy contraptions over there

742
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,990
and there's no monetary exchange
everybody just and brings a skill they

743
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,670
have really good at cooking may be on
the really good massages they're

744
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,570
the No medical work I'm where they can
separate your system I'm kinda brings on

745
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,270
skills to it

746
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,690
I'm anyone has been bringing them to you
is a life changing experience to see

747
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:29,740
a clear that runs like that exactly

748
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,270
and I

749
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,430
in order for Burning Man to be and and
then the freemen it the burn

750
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,940
you know everything they destroy all the
things that they brought because they

751
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,900
want to get rid of the

752
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,350
it at some people have to their
belongings on which is being accountable

753
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,380
on but what's really sad about Burning
Man is that you have all these people

754
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,610
with always amazing skills in all its
inspiration

755
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,310
and apparently a lot of time on their
hands and who spends

756
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,930
eggs over a month money is on our
resources meantime their own

757
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,240
resources from their community bringing
parts are using to community mental

758
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,010
working shop and things like that and
they bring out the desert and they

759
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:04,600
destroyed

760
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,040
and come back to the communities and
burning and over it was only for

761
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,320
weekender however long it lasts and I
think it's that's really sad

762
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,990
on because just communities are being
trained his resources and nobody's going

763
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,870
back to them

764
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:22,000
I am and I think that that hope I love
hope and I but I'm also not a hobby -ism

765
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,440
within the scope of hope on it's really
inspiring to come to focus my second

766
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,710
time here and to see our money

767
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,390
every such a trusting environment every
showing with each other as tools and

768
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,390
gadgets something that people may just
left out on his calf

769
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,910
and to the real trust each other to deal
but these things are not to steal them

770
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:38,890
enough to break them

771
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,950
and a camel to each other and I think
it's really inspiring and feel is bright

772
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:42,560
minds here

773
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,759
all these ideas I am only be cool hokum
you every day

774
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,460
what Fr went beyond a single Packers in
our community what if we all went into

775
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,020
the communion

776
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,280
to other people about hacking on is
common for each other

777
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,430
for us to share information with each
other but that's a conference to go

778
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,520
outside for a little circle of friends
and talk to other people about hacking

779
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,730
talk to other people %ah computing and
security on

780
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,340
and I think that part a hacker ethic
should be

781
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,360
doing matter to me there should be a a
social responsibility from that

782
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,530
I am so take an example for the hacker
ethic as that awesome us with

783
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:16,650
information should be free

784
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,800
at that's fairly vague and I can ask a
question

785
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,470
to whom it should this information be
free right on

786
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,460
he was talking about in New Orleans
another disaster situations where people

787
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,720
are really hungry for information people
who don't have the ability to access it

788
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,320
on we all know the corporations
governments and people got some money

789
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,380
Rd access information really easily they
have enough resources to do that

790
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,680
but for people who don't have the
resources to do that that really

791
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,160
need the information that's where the
information should be going to an

792
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,980
asshole what

793
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,040
the Catamounts we see working on should
do I am

794
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,880
and so I'll take that as an example the
doctor

795
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,520
your doctor in a restaurant and
somebody's choking it's expected that

796
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,200
you're gonna go get that person hammock
maneuver

797
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,000
and they're gonna say their life for at
least make a good effort and and if you

798
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,020
don't you're seen as

799
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,740
some to register him being if if even
that I am

800
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,750
as your lawyer you're expected to do pro
bono work and to give

801
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,040
you know your legal services to the
public good and to get your presentation

802
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:10,470
people

803
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:14,410
I am but in the hacker community would
only happen we have the idea that we

804
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,759
should go back to our own community

805
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,850
we don't have that either we should go
back to communities outside of ourselves

806
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,980
I am not be there's a few hackers you
can see this as a musical project

807
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,300
result from this idea I Wanna Be Free
Geek I'm to the project where hackers

808
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,090
come together

809
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:34,310
yeah please get in for free tickets an
amazing project I am

810
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,920
as a picture from scientific I'm busy
with the project as they collect all the

811
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,230
partially broken computers

812
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,520
electronics they recycle them and the
given to people who normally couldn't

813
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,520
afford computers and the

814
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,270
and in the same at the same time
educating people about computers how

815
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:48,780
they work

816
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,740
and anyone's I N E anyone even whether
hacker not able to go in there

817
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,640
and learn about computers and learn
about what makes them so interesting and

818
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,230
special

819
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,640
what leads us to be so fasten it with
them at this conference

820
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,890
so community responsibility

821
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:07,279
as is ultimately be fine trust that's
also a commuter based on

822
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,460
I'm what makes everyone is from
different from the people I see walking

823
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,590
on the street wonder if

824
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,190
see you differently and the reasons for
the trust you and you trust me on

825
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,540
I don't trust the likes i've known for
my entire life but there's a certain

826
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,509
level trust in our community

827
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:24,320
on more that more than trust you have
the average person

828
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,500
and that's what makes acumen is a good
for people to be able to communicate

829
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,320
freely amongst each other

830
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,930
without feeling on but there's going to
be some type of reprisal further actions

831
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:38,069
and trust comes from cassette right when
you leave all your tools I hope you know

832
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,440
that no one can take it because

833
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,720
its understood to consent

834
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,950
on that know was gonna take them and I
was gonna mess with the things that

835
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:46,850
people

836
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:50,180
if you speak your mind freely here that
no one's gonna hurt you for that

837
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,339
and that space I can send science
consent is implicit son has

838
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,580
explicit I'm for example doctors use

839
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,350
what they're what they call that the
raucous and which means that you're

840
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,240
gonna give a patient medication

841
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,750
if you're going to a patient treatment
you to tell a patient what the risks are

842
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,190
on it is gonna come come together in a
few with other drugs are taking

843
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,220
on parcels conformed consent sometimes
in

844
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,020
we also can set in the round the a
sexual activity worse it's very

845
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,570
important

846
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,340
explicit consent and a I think

847
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,420
but it has been playing offense
situations where should be in fine

848
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,500
I am I think that

849
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,930
our values that we hold an our
understanding that anonymity Israel

850
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:33,470
is integral part is free speech because
if you can speak anonymously

851
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,970
you can speak freely and you can speak
your mind is there might be some who

852
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:37,310
wanted to hurt you for that

853
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,980
and we i think well as covers value
safety and privacy and anonymity

854
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:46,720
and for people lacking in the that means
not for me on your friends

855
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,530
so the question as if those people this
conference

856
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,640
we've cooperated sent converse in jail

857
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,009
hurts on bus or participate in
activities that if

858
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:00,720
results in this destruction apart the
hacker community I'm

859
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,780
have to ask myself is this conference
when it's always been to me

860
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,050
as I'm it's clear that federal agencies

861
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,930
have drawn a line in a sense on the FBI
the Secret Service

862
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,259
other diplomats security those in power
see hackers

863
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,560
as threats to their power they see as a
threat to society stress their

864
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,160
management of information

865
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,890
and when we to security research we find
affordability act economies protocol

866
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,930
we don't ask the people who designed it
for a caveat asked the

867
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:34,240
preserve the software if it's OK for us
ruin the reputation

868
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,050
my sewing other sovereign flossie be
nice to be told them before and before

869
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,200
release the information but if they
don't fix the flaw

870
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,490
it's our obligation to say something
about that to make that information free

871
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:45,940
to those who are most affected by so

872
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,620
that activity in a I've itself as a
threat to power it's a threat to

873
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,319
the people who want to manage
information so for us a line in the sand

874
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,760
is already been dropped

875
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,020
it's clear that there's their manners us
we don't get to decide with this line is

876
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,370
at this point

877
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,920
and so going with that we have to
understand the fed's

878
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,530
the cops especially in the realm of
hacking are strangers to us

879
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,630
they're not hackers they're not a
friends they're not here to learn about

880
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,020
hacking Arctic engage in a thriller a
expression technology

881
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,960
they're here to gather evidence to
prosecute yes they're here to stop us

882
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,300
for mister being information freely

883
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,270
their stuff isn't doing exactly what we
came here to do and so for that reason

884
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,640
we should not talk to them there's
different

885
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:36,109
I'll

886
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:39,060
I have asked people we're talking about
recent situations that happen our

887
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,270
community

888
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,970
imagine if you had a job where you
travel a lot your house is left alone

889
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,980
your pets with their lawn you want to
make sure that your house is safe but

890
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,800
your pet's

891
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,670
were alive when you got back your friend
comes over once a month to check on your

892
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,070
animals and second house to make sure
that

893
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,440
nothing has moved nothing to chance the
doors unlocked

894
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,660
and that person can come to your house
every day from one

895
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,370
every day for a year and check in your
house well i takes one time for the

896
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,109
person to give the keys to someone else

897
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:10,250
interest opera singer and actually when
you have a similar approach to those who

898
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,680
do that

899
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,280
and in conclusion stronger communities

900
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,970
stronger participation from this
community and other communities when we

901
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,070
get together

902
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,400
we're gonna have a stronger hacking
movement and until that happens

903
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,370
divisible Cassidy a problem for us

904
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:29,710
thank you

905
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:33,359
we don't have much time for question so
well

906
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,549
will try to take a couple quick
questions and then

907
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,580
will be around afterwards if you wanna
talk to us

908
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:46,580
how about crisis and technology

909
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,550
right I'm just had a question I

910
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,560
I didn't know where you guys where you
were going with the statement that ham

911
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,910
radios kind about dated

912
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:01,970
I'm I yeah I just wanna say you know it
I think you guys are doing a great

913
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,400
sometimes they have a full-scale
disaster though with the cell networks a

914
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,710
router their jammed with people trying
to make calls

915
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,150
give me a car battery in a piece of wire
my little

916
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,550
low-power FM transmitter can reach
someone in the nursery

917
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,560
second digitize a message in senate
across the country

918
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,310
to sell your family they are safe so I
think it's always going to be

919
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:20,960
alternative

920
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,190
an alternative almost home I sent ham
operator and I'm we also

921
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,570
every I think everybody up here as bill
transmitters

922
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:33,430
work done on if I think what we're
saying is that

923
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,010
up for different circumstances it's not
easily accessible to everybody

924
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,470
like it once was where everybody could
turn into ready but yes it's a great

925
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,980
naturally and areas we're big fans Aires

926
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:48,220
trip there temps want clarified thank
you thanks for doing what you do

927
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,640
%uh hi

928
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,700
so I was in the New Orleans doing tech
work after Katrina

929
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,840
with coming ground for a while and well

930
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,850
the Sourav external structure a bit dead

931
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,910
a lot of useful stuff and a lot of very
important stuff happened a

932
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,420
inside it was kind of a clusterfuck and

933
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,520
I think it's really hard and it takes a
lot of practice to be able to form

934
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,280
cohesive community is a in

935
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,320
in tough times I'm wondering how all we
can get good at that

936
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,640
by what means can we get good at having

937
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,940
real-life communities and like
maintaining structures that work

938
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,820
and don't just two external something
are also like healthy for people inside

939
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,230
them

940
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,490
thank thanks for the question actually
one

941
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,820
things that we then mentions that our
little

942
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,500
group aftershock after alliance Action
Alliance is a new york-based group

943
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,560
and some of what we learned in our I am
participation

944
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:53,140
in the relief work and Katrina is that
it's really important to be supporting

945
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,799
people

946
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,860
in their community in place and not be
an outsider

947
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,870
even when you come with the best
intentions it's always a problem when

948
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,529
you're coming from the outside so

949
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:07,140
our goal is really to be training in
communicating in talking to our

950
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:07,839
neighbors

951
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:12,820
in our communities now before something
bad happens are something that has seen

952
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,670
it perceived as a crisis

953
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,300
as opposed to when everything is in
total disarray sour

954
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,850
we totally agree that it's very
difficult to do it with I'm outsiders

955
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:26,830
and near training other communities
giving trainees to other people

956
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,529
and we're helping people find down apps
I think the thing going

957
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,710
remember to is that up with Katrina was
a really first time

958
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:38,580
that %ah this type of community unlike

959
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,759
the amateur radio community which had
been doing this for ever

960
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,790
was the first time that this type of
community came together for natural

961
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:46,740
disaster

962
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,430
and I think are some things that March
Aaron suffer working on

963
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:55,770
is to try to get more more people using
it not just when there's a natural

964
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,840
disaster

965
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:01,310
but at other times so when when there is
a need can easily flow into them

966
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:08,310
practice i was just wondering if you are
familiar with a neon

967
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,610
channels are networks the recommend
using to make sure that supplies

968
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:19,370
reach like disaster areas and also our
country's their own shippable

969
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:24,080
but Myanmar things like that I think one
idiot

970
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,370
in things that we're trying to work on
its law you know we're

971
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,549
were more this panel was more about

972
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,580
information but did there is %ah good

973
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,500
information on supplies you go to our
website aftershock action

974
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:44,500
likes resource finder

975
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,830
dot com from Google sweet yeah it's a
it's a thing called

976
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,799
Research Fund or just got released by
glue dot org and it's supposed to be

977
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,270
like

978
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,940
we've got then you know an orthopedic
surgeon here

979
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,090
we've got a patient who's got a
screwed-up foot over here

980
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:10,320
men linking them together and I think
that's kinda well one of our concerns is

981
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,080
that we don't

982
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,950
actually no the attitude violence
towards grassroots organizing

983
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,100
and their om obviously very open with
the information that they're collecting

984
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,790
on people

985
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,800
and sharing it with law enforcement and
other agencies that he may not want to

986
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,230
share that information

987
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:33,120
I'm just before last question goes I am

988
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,240
we have some other trapped here om had
bipartisan is also some

989
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,570
I information from them about the
collective what they're doing in your

990
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:40,920
car how to get involved

991
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,440
so if you're in San work on its cast of
I'm come look at what we have on contact

992
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,740
us are also got a table downstairs near
the express elevator

993
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,500
okay in reference to their concerns
about using Google services

994
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,740
a.m. you're using Twitter for love this
stuff

995
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,510
I do you feel about that you feel you
can trust that organization to not

996
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,770
reveal

997
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:05,440
no thank you for asking accidents beat
we can trust winner in fact

998
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,109
and we had two mechanisms for dealing
with that one was asking folks who were

999
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,779
using

1000
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,820
participated by anonymous phones with
cash and

1001
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,530
and recently we had an experience where
Twitter started shutting off

1002
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,830
our feeds answer now were planning on
using other backends

1003
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:25,029
whether that's directly wiring cell
phones or

1004
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:31,640
using a service I ca

1005
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,220
can remember but there's there's
services some are with an API to

1006
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,970
SMS gateway they were looking to

1007
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,030
not not identical next year

1008
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,130
maybe maybe near-term not familiar with
that can remember

1009
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:50,850
also a where that in your people are now
working on

1010
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:54,430
suffer for rokea GSM nodes

1011
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,480
to actually have your be able to create
your own infrastructure using open

1012
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,660
source hardware

1013
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,540
so far that's great news am can we talk
after it is

1014
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:06,759
