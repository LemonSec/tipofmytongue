1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,620
you

2
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:36,920
tonight my instructions here tell me
that I should read

3
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,910
announcement and i'd don't know if there
are any announcements but

4
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,760
consider them read so

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,269
my name is James was ill I work at the
Software Freedom Law Center

6
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:53,500
which is a pro bono non

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,119
profit law firm that does work for
people who make

8
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,589
free software basically we do legal work
for hackers

9
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:04,890
for free because we love you and

10
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,220
because we do legal work for hackers

11
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,149
am were involved in all the issues that
hackers think about it we consider

12
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,840
ourselves

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,679
hackers and tinkers ourselves I mean we
we hack legal systems we all of course

14
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,369
write code and some of us are
electronics TX as well

15
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,429
but we think about a lot of the same
issues

16
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,580
that people to come to a conference

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,060
like hope think about and one of those
issues is freedom

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,920
privacy anonymity in the online space
when you're

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,100
acting online data that is gathered
about you

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,930
and what happens with that data and
we've been thinking about this issue for

21
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,649
a while now

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,609
my boss 7 mobile and give a talk at the
Internet Society

23
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,450
in February where he talked about
something called

24
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,259
the freedom box which is an idea that he
had love

25
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:04,350
an appliance a little Network Appliance
a small computer in his mind it's

26
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,170
applied computer

27
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,350
like a pogo plug or achieve a plug or
something that

28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,150
you plug into the wall and it
intermediates between you

29
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,730
and the Internet sometimes it
impersonates you on the Internet it does

30
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,608
business for you

31
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:22,190
on the network and affects your date as
a passes between you and the outside

32
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,959
world

33
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,220
all with the intention love protecting

34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,560
your control over your own data over
your own privacy

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,010
and over your own anonymity so this talk

36
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,410
is about the freedom box me to talk to
you a little bit about

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,410
very little bit about why

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,380
this is a good time for a device like
this I don't think that's

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,910
a big case to make it a place like hope
but I was gonna talk a little bit about

40
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,959
the specifics

41
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,250
love what we think the box may contain
his his talk was

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,660
serve that the first public throw this
idea out there

43
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,850
he talked about the history I love the
architecture of the Internet have the

44
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,260
the replacement love pure computers with
the server client architecture and

45
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,070
clients at the

46
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,100
edges the network without a lot of power
not doing a lot of computing just

47
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,209
consuming services

48
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,430
and how that process of centralizing

49
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,530
processing also centralize data and such
lies in the data

50
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,699
was what led to a lot of the privacy
concerns that people have today

51
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,260
so he gave a historical background and
said one way we can solve this

52
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,350
is with something called the Freedom
Party to give a lot of detail about what

53
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,509
that box might contain

54
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,609
I'm also not going to give a lot of
detail that what that box may contain

55
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,930
I'm gonna try to take it one step
forward we are at a point right now

56
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,500
we're just gonna feel out

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,829
what it is that this is going to do and
hopefully

58
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,009
this talk especially in this audience

59
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,040
will serve as an invitation to some %uh
view

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,340
to get involved in a project like this
to help us figure out how to build this

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,769
thing

62
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,259
what to put on it and how it's actually
going to operate we think

63
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:02,560
most to the problems are solve problems
and the other problems are solvable

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,320
problems

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,328
in a shorter so that's where we're going

66
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,910
with this conversation in the next 50
minutes

67
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,290
to the need for privacy

68
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,269
we would argue is greater today

69
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,970
the need for device like this is greater
today than it has been in the past and

70
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,090
one other reasons why that happens is
because we walk around

71
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,000
in the world and we have certain beliefs
about our behavior

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,550
when we act in the world we interact
with each other we interact with the

73
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,039
world around us

74
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,440
we engage in behavior in public that we
think is suitable to be in public

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,900
in private we engage in behavior that we
think is suitable to be engaged in

76
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,840
in private what we're increasingly
learning is that

77
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,170
on the network there is less and less
private

78
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,530
there's less and less private space so
more and more people are engaging in

79
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,470
activity

80
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,110
that they were considered to be private
on public

81
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,810
computers computers that they don't own
computers that they don't control

82
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,940
and in that public space their activity

83
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,920
can be watched and it happens in public
great things you do in public people

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,690
watching

85
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,890
doesn't really raise a lot of eyebrows
but

86
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,400
if we're going to increasingly do
private things in these places that are

87
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,290
observed rate on Google's servers

88
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,670
on your Facebook page even over your
email

89
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,760
if you're going to increasingly do these
things

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,400
in these public spaces you also have to
realize that

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,370
is public spaces are increasingly
monitored used to be that you could do

92
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,830
something stupid

93
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,389
in a public space and probably no one
would ever know because no one was ever

94
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:43,139
watching

95
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,720
certainly no one was ever record but now
we know that everything we do

96
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
was remembered for ever everything we do
now online

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,530
sits there's an entry into law and that
log

98
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,500
never gets to lead it doesn't have to it
only gets deleted when its useful life

99
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,670
has disappeared and who knows what the
useful life date is these days

100
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,910
it might be six months it might be six
years it might be twenty years depending

101
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,850
on the data

102
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,090
so more more of what we do online

103
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,500
is recorded and we live now

104
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,480
to accept that we live in our digital
world in what might be described

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,030
as a panopticon everything you do
somebody is watching

106
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:27,710
somebody is recording because you were
doing it on somebody else's server

107
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,150
we are at a point now where the density
of information available to people who

108
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,419
want to know about you

109
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,490
is so high that they can infer

110
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,410
all the little bits about you they don't
know and if you are a person who opts

111
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,300
out of giving them your data

112
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,050
they can infer that you're the other guy
who didn't given the data

113
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,139
we have a guy at the soccer freedom Law
Center his name is Bradley could

114
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,139
and he has never ever

115
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,500
given anyone his social security number
like this is a number

116
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,750
that he knows and his mother knows and
nobody else on the planet knows this

117
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,480
number

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,639
when he when he signed up for to work
with us

119
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,360
he was for the social security number
two you know the Social Security

120
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
Administration

121
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,639
and nobody else in the office has access
to that he hit our health insurer

122
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,770
which requires everyone to give social
security numbers he refused to give it

123
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,490
to them

124
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,510
I mean he has kept this number as
lockdown as you can keep it

125
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,669
lockdown and about a year ago I've been
set him well you know you

126
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,990
you you've really lost the battle Google
knows your social security number

127
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,350
his house a possible I couldn't I've
never given this number

128
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,900
and Evan quite rightly pointed out that
Google knows the social security number

129
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,570
I've everybody else who was born in
Baltimore the year he was born

130
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,159
his social is the other one

131
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,980
rate at the gaps between data have grown
so small

132
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,320
that we can peer at them and see the
outline

133
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,620
up the missing piece and know what is in
there so

134
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,380
those of you who are sitting in this
room who are opting out of giving your

135
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,130
data

136
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,930
to centralized servers to companies that
are going to data mine every

137
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,870
everything that passes across the wire
you you think you might be getting a

138
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,680
certain amount of privacy

139
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,699
and you probably are but you are getting
less

140
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,100
but you might otherwise get if all your
friends weren't also

141
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,940
giving up their data so that's where we
are now we're in a world where

142
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,580
even the people who want to hide who
want to opt out

143
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,729
increasingly have difficulty doing so
and

144
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,240
the reason why we live in that world is
because the data logging

145
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,440
and the data processing in the data
mining has gotten

146
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,589
all-pervasive and as more information
moves online

147
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,589
more activity moves online the amount of
data available

148
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,079
is just going to increase and when we
reach the point

149
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,620
where reliving more lives online

150
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,519
we're gonna have less privacy even then
we do now some people

151
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,320
don't worry about how much privacy they
have some people don't think about those

152
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,190
things they say well I never

153
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,940
I never really give private information
to these companies I never tell them

154
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,829
anything

155
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:06,949
i think is so bad but it turns out that

156
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,959
from relatively innocent data

157
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,920
we can week in find things about you
that you would consider to be much more

158
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,860
private than the innocent information
you gave up

159
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,699
for example there are students at MIT

160
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,969
who by scraping Facebook page data

161
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,079
were able to understand or make

162
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,699
extremely accurate guesses as to the
sexual orientation

163
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,878
other people on Facebook just by looking
at your social network

164
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,430
and to some people who might consider
that private information

165
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,509
they never told Facebook their sexual
orientation

166
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:46,050
they never announced this to anyone in
the Facebook community

167
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,600
maybe not even to anyone in there
offline world

168
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,970
to suddenly have that information
discoverable in favorable

169
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,420
for all the other data that might be a
scary topic that might be a scary

170
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,110
proposition

171
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,790
so we live in a world where the amount
of data about you

172
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,849
is increasing and the things we think
I've

173
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,189
as innocent information are not so
innocent when you aggregate

174
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,379
and when you take all the data you can
get about you from Facebook and add it

175
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,459
all the data you can get about you from
Google

176
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:19,939
and at all the data you can get about
you from online

177
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:23,709
databases and mass marketing databases
in government records

178
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,749
we can paint a fairly convincing picture
of who you are you at

179
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:31,369
use a sprinkling a little bit of
demographic information and suddenly we

180
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,119
have

181
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,160
a picture who you are as a person I mean
you know

182
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,809
Google knows more about you then anyone
else on the planet

183
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,300
Google knows if you're cheating on your
spouse

184
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,809
Google knows your HIV status I mean
Google knows

185
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:51,118
if you're failing out of school Google
knows any secret you might have

186
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:54,459
cool Kool Haus so

187
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:58,879
that's that's that's the landscape the
landscape is privacy is harder to

188
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,069
achieve now

189
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,339
than it ever has been the things that we
think I love

190
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,899
as things we can do in public and it
doesn't matter if anyone's watching

191
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:14,899
it turns out that those are betraying
our privacy as well

192
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,569
so there that's where we live we live in
that world where privacy is increasingly

193
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,009
difficult to get

194
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:26,990
we also live in a world where people
claim to value their privacy very highly

195
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,350
but are willing to sell it very cheaply
when actually

196
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,730
engaging with online services rate
everyone in here would would think it

197
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,149
themselves as a privacy night

198
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,160
but I bet you a lot of you guys are
using Gmail

199
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,589
and I bet you a lot of you guys are
using Facebook so we we all

200
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,999
value our Privacy very highly in this
notion away

201
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,079
but if you look at behavior we're not
putting up we're not putting a high

202
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,389
price on privacy

203
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:54,519
what we're doing is were wishing things
were better

204
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,519
and we're selling the data sort of semi
reluctantly

205
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,839
but not thinking about it very hard and

206
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,160
if we the people in this room

207
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,839
who are the most likely people in the
world to care about this issue

208
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,689
are willing to take that step it's very
difficult for me standing here to

209
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:14,679
imagine

210
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,309
how we're going to convince the kinds of
people who wouldn't be in this room

211
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:24,829
to value their privacy in actual
behavioral practice

212
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:28,779
so we have to realize we can't protects

213
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:33,839
all those people most privacy discussion
start from the point of view of how can

214
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,139
we change society

215
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,410
how can we move the privacy environment

216
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,839
so that we all get more privacy and I
would argue

217
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,850
that that's the wrong approach I would
argue that at this point

218
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,889
that battle is is lost at least for now

219
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,889
what we should be asking is how can we
get privacy

220
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:57,910
for ourselves in an environment that is
extremely hostile to our own

221
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,519
notions a privacy and anonymity and so
when I think about the freedom box

222
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,220
I think of it as a device that is not
necessarily going to

223
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,720
sweet the world of a facebook I think
about as a device

224
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,179
that is going to allow you to decide

225
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,910
this is control love my data and it
won't necessarily control anyone elses

226
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,899
date it wants to convince

227
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,019
anyone else to do anything but this box
has has that sort of limited scope

228
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,259
at least in my mind and you know who
knows what it will actually look like in

229
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:26,989
the end

230
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:31,679
but thats that's one thing that we have
to consider

231
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,220
okay so that's that's my little spiel on
privacy that's sort of where I'm coming

232
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,360
from and privacy

233
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,619
we live an increasingly hostile world
what can we do to protect ourselves

234
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,259
everyone else is lost we can save them

235
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,749
run so that's

236
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:49,929
that's the privacy landscape we need to
now talk about

237
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,629
what does the box actually do to exist

238
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:58,220
in that landscape and we've got a guy at
Law Center

239
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,600
his name is Ian Sullivan who loves
buying gadgets

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,470
and every time you know Engadget covers
some small

241
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,619
winik's arm box it ends up on his desk
three days later I'm not quite sure how

242
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:10,899
he manages to

243
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,149
get to the front line on that but he
does and so we've got a bunch of these

244
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:14,509
little

245
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:17,600
little gadgets and we envision the
freedom box

246
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,529
as a plug computer with an armed ship

247
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:24,759
that's the target architecture for now
you plug it into the wall

248
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,069
is your router is your firewall it
decides what package come in what

249
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,149
packets go out

250
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,230
but more importantly it implements
policy

251
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,759
as in what packets are we going to
encrypt but packets are we going to

252
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,509
send to certain people if somebody
request information about you

253
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:45,049
who are we going to give it are we going
to give it to them how much state are we

254
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,779
gonna give them and in what for

255
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,610
so the boxes not just a router it's a
router that is

256
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,089
designed to have your privacy in mind

257
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,920
it is also but or exit node

258
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,399
it is also a VPN box rate so people who
happen to live in countries that stick

259
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,179
man behind

260
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,759
giant firewalls might be able to access
the free internet

261
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,439
by talking to your computer first so
this is a a device not just for your

262
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,209
freedom

263
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:17,860
not just for your privacy but also to
enhance the privacy and freedom

264
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,649
environments

265
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,459
other people to give anonymity to other
people and that's why

266
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,869
we think it's important that include
something like it or exit node like BP

267
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:28,290
and software

268
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,309
in the software we envision

269
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:36,949
astept a freedom stack at the bottom is
this sort of networking stuff

270
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:40,119
is the sort of thing that will just
allow you to communicate with other

271
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:40,679
people

272
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,329
without wearing as much about privacy as
you do now

273
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,579
above that level is some sort of system
where

274
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,910
something that that is going to send
data something that's gonna send data ok

275
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,029
using these protocols and that's going
to start to look like

276
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,939
encrypt the data base a an
authentication mechanism for deciding

277
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:02,910
who can access stuff for deciding that
you are you

278
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,649
for being able to say I am you for be
able to

279
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,470
authenticate to other computers as you
are agent on the net and this is

280
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,579
infrastructure generalizable
infrastructure

281
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:17,379
that we would hope would get used for
building applications

282
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,509
that allow people to implement some of
the services that we are currently using

283
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:23,119
that

284
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:27,350
steal our Privacy instead as services
that only log

285
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,989
to this box or better yet don't log at
all and so

286
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:35,970
by using these ceta services we're
hoping you can build

287
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,600
a set of applications to replace things
like Twitter

288
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,739
and Facebook and Flickr and so if you
want

289
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:48,239
to use the private versions the privacy
enhanced versions of the services

290
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:52,309
this box will serve the data for you and
most importantly

291
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:56,160
hold and not give it to some other
company

292
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,509
that is going to then data mining and
sell it to other people

293
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:03,369
and the ideas that your data is safe
because it never leaves

294
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:06,929
your box and your data is there

295
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:13,069
locked up for only you to decide what to
do

296
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,629
so that's that's the box from top to
bottom it's a it's a simple stack

297
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,199
it's a simple device that plugs into the
wall and

298
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,780
above the the application layer

299
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,600
you've got a buncha protocols from
moving data between applications moving

300
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,250
data between boxes and this is how the
boxes get social

301
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,409
right this is how instead of
centralizing your social networking

302
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:41,490
in one website your box is going to talk
to other web sites

303
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,389
to other boxes and decide okay I've got
an RSS feed

304
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:49,370
photos of my last party you can have it
because I know you and I trust you when

305
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,720
you're in my network

306
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,240
but I'm only going to give it to you
because those photos are private or

307
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,250
you can decide this is my blog anyone's
allowed to read my blog

308
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,899
and it will serve that for you as well
said the simple idea

309
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,529
I've having UserControl over their own
device

310
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:09,659
is not a new idea the new idea is
putting it

311
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:13,639
in an appliance that you plug into the
wall and don't have to do a whole lot of

312
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,870
configuration on

313
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,010
the new idea is to make it as turnkey as
possible

314
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,820
were finally reaching the the point
where we don't even have to tell people

315
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,340
download the software

316
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,610
and install and configure it we've
reached a point were all we have to do

317
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,889
is say to people

318
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:32,590
by this piece of plastic plug it into
the wall

319
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,000
you're done baby tell your name

320
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,470
and then everything else is just
standard application software

321
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,639
all this software already exists

322
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:46,519
we have to our software we have people
trying to write

323
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:49,549
the the system-level and we have people
hacking on the

324
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:53,370
the the application where so that's
that's the basic idea

325
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,710
behind the three pieces

326
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,840
up the box

327
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,500
serve that the hard part with doing
something like this

328
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,830
is that there are certain parts of the
software that don't already exist right

329
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,610
like I mean we

330
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,570
we want this box to pull-down torrance
in encrypt it matter

331
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,840
that's really easy to do we have softer
that will already do that

332
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,199
were missing is the stuff

333
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,049
that allows you to do the authentication
decentralized

334
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:28,000
authentication turns out to be really
hard especially

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,529
if you wanna do it in such a way that if
your box dies

336
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,889
you don't lose any of your data rate you
want your box

337
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:38,889
to backup all the pieces have data to
all your friends boxes

338
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:42,620
in an encrypted manner so that they can
read it but if you ever need to you can

339
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,490
say to them

340
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,740
hey giving my data back this is not the
easiest thing to do it's hard to figure

341
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,269
out

342
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:52,159
what is the thing the user will hold
that will allow them to say

343
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,350
I M E and you should give me my data

344
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,450
unlock my data so these the the unsolved
problem

345
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,260
love how we decide when do you get data
and when you don't get data

346
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,429
in this decentralized way across the
network is one of the things

347
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:12,580
that I think you guys in this audience
are particularly good at thinking about

348
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,428
and that's the reason why we came here
today was to ask you guys

349
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,110
to think about this sort of idea and to
help us architect

350
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,260
that layer of the system

351
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,289
so authentication turns out to be one of
the

352
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:29,529
really hard problems are a lot of people
that have looked at this mean

353
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,330
every decentralized Facebook like
application

354
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,080
every decentralize social networking
application like crab grass or something

355
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,779
like that

356
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,759
has wrestled with this problem none of
them claimed to have solved it in an

357
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,669
adequate manner

358
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,970
none of them claimed to have nailed it
so

359
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,990
we need somebody to start thinking about
this in a serious way

360
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,720
and we hope to provide a forum where
people can do that

361
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,820
this is a solvable problem it is an
architecture problem

362
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:04,149
but it is not a it is not impassable
problem even if it might be difficult

363
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:08,179
so the second major challenge love a
device like this

364
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,309
is secured obviously

365
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:15,580
we're building a box that is gonna hold
all your data and everyone's gonna have

366
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,019
the same box it's going to be

367
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,690
maybe an enticing target I don't know
somebody's gonna wanna somebody's gonna

368
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,549
wanna crack on the spock somebody's
gonna wanna knock on a door

369
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,610
and not only do we need to make sure
that when we ship it

370
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,159
it's got the latest and best security we
can find we need to make sure that that

371
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,059
the thing updates properly

372
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,279
and on the one hand

373
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,580
security updates RRR re: solve problem

374
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,879
in the Linex world on the other hand

375
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,009
the first time this thing breaks open

376
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,399
we're gonna lose everybody's audience so

377
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,889
security on this box is

378
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:59,090
not just keeping the box safe it's
knowing that the date on the box is

379
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,070
safer knowing that when you move the
data to other boxes

380
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,158
in an encrypted way that's going to get
there not

381
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,120
not get intercepted in the middle and
finally the last

382
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,019
real challenge a building something like
the freedom box

383
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:16,610
is the interface and I said plug it in
and walk away and I was a little

384
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,549
simplistic

385
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:20,700
but ultimately it needs to be

386
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,860
as easy that as plug it in

387
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,980
answer a couple of questions be up and
running in every time you wanna do

388
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,409
something additional

389
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,419
all you need to do is click a couple
buttons and yes

390
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,779
you can get under the hood if you want
to but we don't want users to have to do

391
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:36,419
that

392
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,370
it should be a simple as I tell you how
you know I'm me

393
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,509
I tell you how you authenticate me to
you as a box right plug the cable into

394
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:45,419
the thing

395
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,860
hook up my laptop whatever once you do
that

396
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,919
it should have automatic to faults for
as much as possible right don't ask me

397
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,389
do I run the Tor network yes just run it
just do it so

398
00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:00,710
assembling that interface from a buncha
pieces

399
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,149
is is is a heart problem and we in the
the Linux community are getting better

400
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,940
at interfaces but we haven't actually
gotten there yet so those I think are

401
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,470
the three major areas:

402
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,360
where we need our help actually making
this box happen we need a high-level

403
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,100
view of what it's going to do

404
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,759
and then we need to start drilling down
on these three heart problems and

405
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,080
ultimately

406
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,389
this box it's just a Linux distribution

407
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:26,399
all this box is is one variant

408
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:29,860
love Debian probably

409
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,070
it's got a target architecture it's got
a target format

410
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,240
but theoretically could run on anything
you can run on your old laptop

411
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,549
you can run on on any box that you have
that you want to use for this purpose

412
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:43,240
so that's that's the freedom box in a
nutshell it's a box that is designed

413
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,070
just for this one purpose

414
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,500
managing a little bit of your personal
data and not giving it away

415
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,610
letting you keep the data in your own
apartment

416
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,659
without anyone else seeing it unless you
want to see

417
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,539
I will take questions

418
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:05,539
yes

419
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,980
so so the question was how does this
address the problem

420
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,060
love once data is out there its out
there

421
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,210
you can't get it back and it doesn't it
doesn't address the problem %uh

422
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,760
if you give your data to other people
you lose a little bit of control over

423
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,390
your data

424
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,360
what it does do is it gives you control
over who you give the data to

425
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,550
see if you only give the data to people
you trust to your friends

426
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,590
that's a private conversation right we
have private conversations with people

427
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,490
all the time

428
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,580
and they can repeat the things we say

429
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,860
they can forward are emails they can
gossip about us there's a certain level

430
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,690
I've risk and trust involved in any
interaction we have with any other

431
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,290
people

432
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,420
the problem right now is we have
interactions with individuals

433
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,530
that happen at a certain expectation of
trust

434
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,639
but the whole conversation is listen to
by outside parties

435
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,330
who have no respect for the trust so
once you

436
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,720
eliminate those other third parties your
date is gonna go as far as that person

437
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,430
will take it

438
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,490
and you're left with just about as much
privacy as you have in the offline world

439
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,040
if you share your data you've shared
your data the question is who are you

440
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,440
sharing it with and that's what this box
is designed

441
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,670
to protect make sense anybody else

442
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:32,670
yes the gentleman in the back

443
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,438
so that the question was what about

444
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:45,919
physical access to the box how do you
keep the box secure if somebody has

445
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,239
physical access to an end

446
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:51,489
the answer is look if someone has
physical access your box

447
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:54,649
you lose that thats pretty much

448
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,019
universal it will lock everything down
and encrypt it but if they come with the

449
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:58,629
warrants

450
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:03,729
you're going to you're going to either
given the information or sit in jail

451
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,199
you're either going to get in the past
reverse in jail so yeah

452
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,669
the box will have everything in cryptid
beyond that

453
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,179
if they want to you know brute force
turkey

454
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:17,349
that there's not a whole lot you can do
about that I mean it is a computer

455
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:24,349
and it's not much more than a computer
%uh the question is can you be compelled

456
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:28,319
to

457
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,459
give a password and the answer is

458
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:37,529
people have been compelled to give
passwords

459
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:41,819
in certain instances you know we all we
all read about the case of a system

460
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,219
administrator in San Francisco

461
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:46,629
sat in jail because he wouldn't covered
the passwords to the the local city

462
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:47,109
network

463
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:50,408
so yeah that that is a thing that could
happen

464
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:53,959
if somebody knocks on your door but
that's no different than any other risk

465
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:55,599
you run by keeping date on a computer

466
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:02,599
sir

467
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,560
well I mean

468
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,980
no one can use the data against you
unless they have it the ideas that

469
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,480
if you keep control of the data and you
don't have to keep much rate I mean

470
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,210
the thing is not we're not going to
intend for end-users

471
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,010
to do a whole lot of maintenance on a so
it's not going to keep a whole lot of

472
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,740
logs

473
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,640
so it's going to keep just enough data
to do the job it's designed to do

474
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,790
and if you if you delete something it
will really be gone

475
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:47,480
beyond that you know its it if your
gonna keep records you're going to keep

476
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,800
records and yes putting them all in one
place

477
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,030
like I said makes it attractive target
but that's why we need security in the

478
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,540
box

479
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,100
I'm it it is much better to have the
data

480
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,500
on your box and vulnerable to
hypothetical threats

481
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,280
than already in the hands of people who
don't like you which is where we are now

482
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,280
yessir

483
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,659
sure sure that that is absolutely true
that the box itself as a physical object

484
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:38,929
would be valuable to anyone who has the
ability to break the encryption on it

485
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:40,340
and frankly

486
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,029
if people have the ability to break our
strongest encryption

487
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:48,000
we've already lost you know people can
take the box

488
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,940
your average home burglar if he has

489
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,820
some giant massive array of computers to
brute-force turkey or some magic wand

490
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,700
and technology

491
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,890
I don't know why he's rubbing your
apartment but I mean you know

492
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,870
maybe it's his hobby you could see
richard fineman doing something like

493
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,820
this raid

494
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:13,820
yessir I

495
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:27,649
I mean

496
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,990
you know it I don't think that we're
going to pop-up

497
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,720
messages that's a warning you were about
to tell Facebook something you shouldn't

498
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,390
tell them

499
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:41,000
rather people who buy this device are
already interested in privacy

500
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,530
and so it will be perhaps a tool for
configuring Facebook

501
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,760
to give you the best privacy within that
environment

502
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,800
I'm it'll perhaps have a competitor to
Facebook

503
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,440
maybe one that's interactive with
Facebook so you can participate in the

504
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,160
Facebook community to a certain degree

505
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,270
without giving them all of your data
people are gonna wanna act

506
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,840
in the real world and they're going to
want to interact with companies that

507
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,260
don't respect their data there's nothing
we can do about that

508
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,060
if you want to go do that there's only
so much protection we can give you

509
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,120
and we want to serve people along
wherever on the spectrum

510
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,490
they might want to be but yeah if you
wanna go and

511
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:23,730
tell Facebook everything about yourself
we're not gonna jump in your way and

512
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,660
physically stop

513
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:31,660
Chur

514
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:16,910
sure I mean

515
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:33,990
well

516
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:40,990
I mean that the box isn't going to do
that I mean the box is not a lawyer

517
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,480
so the question was

518
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,090
the box is designed to protect privacy
but a lot after day does already out

519
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,380
there how do you get back

520
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,120
and the the answer is you can't I mean

521
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,050
the to the extent that it is out there
it is very difficult to retract

522
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:22,530
the idea is not to give new data you
know and and maybe some others who have

523
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,500
already given up our social security
employment such as your numbers are are

524
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,750
never going to be private again

525
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,760
and his box is gonna change that
specific problem I don't think

526
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,760
yes

527
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:50,309
yeah I mean you know it whether the box
will or will not contain

528
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:54,759
do. software to to makes furious Google
searches i think is an open question

529
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:55,999
it's something that

530
00:32:55,999 --> 00:33:00,169
will will get decided at a much later
date and we are now I'm in right now

531
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:03,830
these are all good ideas I don't know
how many that will actually stick to the

532
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,169
wall

533
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:11,169
for your is definitely a good idea
yessir

534
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,549
yeah I I I wouldn't say that I i'ma

535
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:37,460
Linex partisan and I wouldn't say that
when I said it's a Linux box that is a

536
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,239
pronouncement have any kind mean it will
be a box that will run some

537
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:44,659
variant of some nicks that will be
decided by whoever

538
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:48,479
actually builds the box whose wheelers
actually doing the architecting

539
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:53,109
that won't actually be me so yeah if
OpenBSD turns out to be the thing that

540
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:56,369
that they decide to use I don't see any
reason why it could be used

541
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:03,369
this gentleman the back has been waiting
for a while sure

542
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,789
yeah I don't know that so the question
was

543
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:18,220
companies right now take a lot of your
data how can we convince them to you

544
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,500
instead of taking our data to hold
cryptographic blobs

545
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,280
for the purpose of identifying us I
don't know that we can convince them I

546
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,619
mean

547
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,170
the box is not designed to convince
companies

548
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,069
to act against their interests I'm if
you get enough people together who

549
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:34,808
decide that using the box is great and

550
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:38,280
don't get me wrong I hope that everyone
will plug one into their wall

551
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,210
but a lot of people want because they
can barely put their computers into the

552
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:42,619
wall

553
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,589
but maybe everybody

554
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:50,410
know somebody but they trust enough to
run their plug for them

555
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,618
and maybe somebody's plugs will be

556
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:57,030
multi-user and maybe something will
serve a lot of people if you get

557
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,270
aggregation have enough people together
who are

558
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,288
using this technology as a default then
the ability to

559
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,950
adjust the technology on the box adjusts
people's

560
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,319
adjust the way people interact with the
wider net

561
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:14,430
and the way they interact with other
services on the net and once you can

562
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,190
aggregate

563
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,609
thats hors d'oeuvres power you have an
ability to to have real conversations

564
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:22,630
with companies about what their
incentives really might be

565
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,760
do they actually wanna serve this
population to the

566
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,869
actually want to allow these people to
use their services and take money from

567
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:30,230
them

568
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,270
if they do they might be willing to talk
to us about

569
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:40,270
what the what the limits of that data
mining are yessir

570
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:05,040
so the question is are we actually

571
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,190
making software and and or should we
just as I mister protocols and the

572
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,849
answer

573
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:14,650
to that question is at some point you
need to hand somebody a box with

574
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,760
software on it that box

575
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,150
has to contain more than just
descriptions are protocols

576
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:25,000
it needs to contain running code that
code might run on a BSD system it might

577
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,180
run a Linux system

578
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,730
maybe you know a project like this could
could support multiple systems

579
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,160
but we don't see any need to frankly the
idea is to get one

580
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,240
working version ovett not to get
something that compiles on every

581
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,700
chip in Borden the planet I'm get
something in people's hands that they

582
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,410
can use

583
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,710
we are not partisan between various
platforms but on the other hand

584
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:53,710
some point you have to pick one yessir

585
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,480
I i agree that the boxes are attractive
targets for people looking to

586
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,480
break in and take data and that is why
securities important

587
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,010
yeah I mean that

588
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,750
the question was how deep do you need to
get into the data to actually make real

589
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,990
policy decisions and that's that's a
valid

590
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,910
question but the the answer is you don't
need to get very deep at all

591
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,279
to make some %uh the the big policy
decisions right you can

592
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,620
you can look at traffic and say oh

593
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:04,029
you know it dad is a torrent we need to
route that in a way that doesnt

594
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,500
that doesn't move it towards us right
this is a VPN connection

595
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,190
we can wrap that through the VPN so to
the extent that people are

596
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,500
moving data around we can look at the
packets just like anyone else we can

597
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,060
shape

598
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,150
our own traffic I'm we can tell it

599
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,930
more about what that traffic might look
like if we want to give it more

600
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,830
information

601
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:27,140
and that will enable us to in Acts real
policy so you don't actually need to

602
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,220
read every packet they caused by you can
gather data from

603
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:37,220
the context each packet yes the

604
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,150
the question was what about personal
legal liability for

605
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,000
running toward exit nodes and what else
and open proxies

606
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,090
so you know I I'm not a claim to be an
expert

607
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,700
in legalities running tore exit it's a
few if you really want that answer

608
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,100
you should talk to Wendy seltzer but

609
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,950
her opinion is that at least 1 I've
talked to her

610
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,160
is that there isn't a whole lot of legal
risk and if you are

611
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,480
if you are worried about the legal risk
you can still run it or no that is not

612
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,350
an exit node

613
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,900
if you if you think that's a problem
that that's the short answer I could not

614
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,880
give you specifics not having looked
into it specifically myself

615
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,480
yes

616
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:34,480
yes absolutely gentlemen the back

617
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:49,069
yet the the question is what happens if
the user gives up the password or or

618
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:51,829
even more importantly what happens if
the user forgets the password

619
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:56,250
I think those are those are both heart
problems when I talked earlier about

620
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,210
authentication being difficult that was
the kind of thing i'm talking about. no

621
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,390
one has really solved

622
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,839
this problem well and one of the reasons
why is that no one has solved the

623
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:06,788
problem of the

624
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:10,369
untrustworthy user we don't know

625
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:14,010
what that solution is going to look like
I I have some ideas

626
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,430
but I don't think any them are very good
if you have better ideas

627
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:26,430
I would really like to hear them I am
talking about she fucks yes

628
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,339
area she looks so

629
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,890
if you are looking for an idea of what
the box will actually look like

630
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,058
this is it its it's a rectangular piece
a plastic

631
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:46,059
with an outlet on it flock so thank you
the new ones are smaller and

632
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,960
I mean the brilliance of this is that
when they first came out there around a

633
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,809
hundred bucks

634
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:54,619
I just bought three of them for $24.99 I
mean these boxes

635
00:41:54,619 --> 00:42:00,009
are really really cheap so the idea be
able to put this into people's hands

636
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:03,259
at a price level that they can afford is
is is realizable

637
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:06,359
this isn't the One Laptop Per Child
project

638
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,799
this isn't a giant hacking marathon

639
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:13,880
rate the hardware is done the software

640
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,730
is most of the way there it's the
crucial interconnecting bits

641
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,859
a little bit interface and a little bit
of authentication

642
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:23,920
and that's it rate this is

643
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,019
a Linux distribution or a PSD
distribution

644
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:30,140
and thats sounds like a big project

645
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,058
but really you're only cobbling together
a very limited suite of software

646
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:37,220
it's not gonna take twenty thousand man
hours to put this

647
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,230
to put this together thanks thank you
for the demonstration

648
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:47,230
yes sir

649
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:17,860
well

650
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,850
sure a min you know that he's talking
about separating

651
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,040
data that is personal to you versus data
that has just passed through your VPN

652
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,550
our pastor your or and I don't
understand why anyone would keep any

653
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,100
data

654
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,010
that they don't need and you certainly
don't need data about stuff that is

655
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,730
passed through

656
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,880
so if you don't have data you can't give
it away

657
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,890
and the idea would be that if you are

658
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:47,890
running a tornado Gernot locking stuff
sure

659
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,640
sure and if if that is if if if
spreading your data to other machines is

660
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,259
a thing that

661
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,250
that people want to do yeah we would
have to do legal architecture as well as

662
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,350
pack on it from a tech you yessir

663
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:12,350
yes

664
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,910
church yet I'm not saying there no legal
risks absolutely

665
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:48,910
if you will if you want to give it or no
to different IP address

666
00:44:53,319 --> 00:45:00,319
sure

667
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,540
you could turn it off

668
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:09,540
it will be configurable 0

669
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,759
I you know my at my idea for
configuration is sane defaults

670
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:21,200
right and I believe that's the same
default ok

671
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,200
yes sir

672
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,740
so the suggestion was that we that we
look at both monkeys fearing canoe

673
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,010
social p2p as pieces I've

674
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,800
software for the box and I think that's
a great idea I think those are both good

675
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,800
pieces of technology yes sir

676
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,520
yet the question is what about getting
data into the box

677
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,950
and you note that that again is an open
question

678
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,800
right i mean how are you gonna tell it
what you've done I guess you could give

679
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,430
it your

680
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,660
give your credentials let's scrape let
it download

681
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,129
you know the question of how we do that

682
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:36,130
in a legal manner is an open question

683
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,570
what when we talked about the system
where that sorta

684
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:54,330
standard privacy model is the kind of
thing that would be to be developed now

685
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,670
I mean we live in a world where

686
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,980
user permissions and group permissions

687
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,230
are the starting point for a lot of how
we think about access controls

688
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,370
and I expect that that would be the
starting point for this conversation as

689
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:08,859
well

690
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,800
identifying group of people and saying
treat them in this matter right this is

691
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,630
my friend

692
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,760
this is my mother don't show my mother

693
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,760
pictures that I only want my friends to
see show freak out yessir

694
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,819
well the ideas that this box is your
firewall

695
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:43,849
obviously if you plug it in at work

696
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:48,290
you might have a different problem there
are ways to

697
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,109
balance information of computers that
arent firewalled

698
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:55,259
and anyone who has done any work in the
torrent world

699
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,530
is aware of that kind of stuff but yeah
I think

700
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:03,200
punching holes and firewalls is a thing
we as a community have gotten

701
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,290
really good at quite recently for the
most part though we really hope the box

702
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:12,259
is your firewall and in any conversation
between two people

703
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,290
we think there's a high likelihood that
one of those people

704
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:22,290
is not behind a firewall yessir

705
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,480
sure I mean that the question was how
can you receive

706
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,609
email or contact if you've never tell
anyone where you are if you're always

707
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:45,279
hiding in

708
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:49,359
it that the answer starts at dynamic dns
so people can find you

709
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,200
and the back into that answer is some
form of encryption

710
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,619
so that people can right to you without
other people listening

711
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:02,480
now that's privacy if you want anonymity
you're going to have to start routing

712
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,890
things through something like an onion
network and there are ways to

713
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,670
route things through anonymizer in paths
to get to you

714
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,519
you can even do something that looks a
lot like email in that context

715
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,759
i'd I don't know that this box is going
to you do that right off the bat but it

716
00:49:17,759 --> 00:49:18,900
is something that we would

717
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,940
certainly hope to see happen at some
point any other questions

718
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,829
yessir yes

719
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:33,200
well I mean

720
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,730
we have we're not going to sit down and
write to Facebook loan

721
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,960
we're really hoping the the Diaspora
guys succeed

722
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,920
in a way that makes it a lot of that
technology reusable in the sense in the

723
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,749
same way that we're not going to you

724
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:51,509
write an Onion Router we're gonna use
tor if there is off-the-shelf solutions

725
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:52,119
that work

726
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,980
we would really like to use them week
really believe

727
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,700
that by creating a network decentralized
servers

728
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,970
where everyone can have their server
back instead of being a client

729
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:09,009
in the system that people will start to
write applications that use that new

730
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:12,109
slash old network architecture and

731
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,180
yeah the spores definitely a project
that we have our eye on

732
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:21,419
I don't see any other questions

733
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,180
so I'm just gonna say this project's

734
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,519
as you can see from this conversation is
still at a very

735
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:31,710
early-stage there's a lot of things that
need to be worked out

736
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,460
and this conversation is not about
telling you the box is going to do X Y

737
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,700
and Z the box is gonna have ABC software
on it this conversation

738
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,759
is about telling you that the box is
being planned

739
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:45,920
this conversation is about saying if you
are interested

740
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,239
in helping to develop a box that
protects your privacy

741
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,819
the time to get involved is now the time

742
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:58,119
to give us your ideas is now and the
time to help us identify

743
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:02,059
other people who would be interested in
putting some real

744
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,940
energy behind an effort like this is now
so few

745
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,480
specifically have ideas have access to
resources

746
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,099
have names of people who you think would
be

747
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:16,539
well-served by working and collaborating
on this idea

748
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:20,430
right now talk to me afterwards cuz I
would love

749
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:24,650
to talk to you get your information and
start actually connecting people

750
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:28,230
might want to start doing the actual
work a packing instead of

751
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,910
standing here talking to you about stuff
you know that doesn't exist

752
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,249
so thank you very much and I hope to
talk I love you
