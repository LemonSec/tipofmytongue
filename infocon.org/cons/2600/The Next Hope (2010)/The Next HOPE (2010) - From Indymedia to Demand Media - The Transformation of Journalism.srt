I'm one of the projects and to be
talking about today which is i

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,990
in the media the New York Europe version
of the media would not have existed

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,100
without the

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,220
incredible support the folks at 2600 up
for many years so this is a chance for

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,970
me to kind of

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,350

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,430
okay on so you know

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,530
I was asked to speak here today about
kinda

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,870
when I talk to my castle about it he
said hey could you you know maybe you

36
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,019
want to talk about how what's going on
in journalism

37
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,440
I'll so that's wanna talk about today
I'm gonna talk about how what's going on

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
in journalism

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,849
and i wanna try if I can to arm related

40
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,819
to it

41
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,159
what to a lot of the issues that some
you all have talked about yeah

42
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,120
in this conference um if I can

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,069
so basically MCM talking about some the
ideas I have

44
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,810
about what i think is going on in
journalism right now I'll

45
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,180
and how journalism relates to a lot of
the things they rely on technology

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,840
and i really wanna hear up what a lot at
you think about this

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,840
okay cell first I'll show of hands who
here has ever heard

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,750
love the organization called in the
media most

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,450
two years ever heard of an organization
called Demand Media

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,690
that's what I thought okay good

51
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,829
so it's nice when you ask that question
that show of hands is exactly what you

52
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,860
think it's gonna be so

53
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,990
his wrist thing the friend you can see
almost everyone here has heard in the

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,569
media

55
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,930
are very few love you have heard have
anything called Demand Media

56
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,470
on and i wanna talk to you about what
demand media is today

57
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,290
okay on a star with the story I

58
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,540
and the story is this so on the last day
%uh

59
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,319
the recoup here was around for the
Republican National Convention in 2004

60
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,520
are at a lot a lot a view

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,599
I'll the last day other Republican
National Convention here in New York

62
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,060
City in 2004

63
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,440
for those of you who weren't around I
don't remember it there were is a

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,840
convention there are massive protests
against the republicans in New York

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,610
there were many many arrests probably
the

66
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,630
other Republican National Convention 04
was the high point in the media in New

67
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,420
York City

68
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,720
I'll when it came to sort a
decentralized participant during a news

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,470
coverage

70
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,480
on and it was also in addition to the
journalism that was provided there

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,750
arm it was a massive logistical and
organisational

72
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,370
undertaking on it was it was massive
there was a huge space rented out there

73
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,760
was a

74
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,120
incredible amount of coordination %uh
volunteers and people it was very basic

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,420
on it all of this you know blobs were
around at this point 2004

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,009
they were starting to become hip I you
know is starting to pick up

77
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,400
it to be a blotter but pretty much
everything that in the media in New York

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,569
did in 2004 regarding the Republican
National Convention

79
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:31,410
predated blogs that predated Twitter it
predated all that stuff that we now know

80
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,720
a lot about when it comes to sort new
forms of journalism

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,580
arm and I was intimately involved in

82
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,370
planning organizing for the republican
national convention coverage in 2004 so

83
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,250
I know

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,010
what was going on pretty well up so okay

85
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,680
to the night of Sept 1st 2004 I don't
know how well you can see that the night

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,780
of Sept 1st 2004

87
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,120
on you know people have been going you
know it's a lot like the whole

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,790
conference

89
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,310
is for the organizers right people have
been going crazy for weeks

90
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,470
everyone is exhausted are everybody's
getting really

91
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,530
punchy everybody's friends have been
arrested

92
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,290
you know they're a bunch of people who
are locked up in this sup appear on the

93
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,449
far west side

94
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,080
up you know people are are getting kinda
Ranney

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,400
and all of a sudden this this post pops
up on

96
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,990
on what was called the open newswire
I'll and

97
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,389
the reads like this arm the

98
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,419
the headline is up from the we could
make

99
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,500
this up Department and someone called

100
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,060
eyes everywhere wrote quote folks that
sounds unbelievable but it's true

101
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,220
coming back from a brilliant an
important protest against the corporate

102
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,340
media walking back to my car popped in
forty-eight Street

103
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,610
just with a West 5th Avenue there on the
corner

104
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,660
I saw a large gain undercover slash
scooter cops

105
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,090
some in uniform to swarming around a
phone booth

106
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,870
damage was curious because the cops were
bathed in what I call it television glow

107
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,280
it turns out there on the internet
cruising none other than our favorite

108
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,229
new york city in the media

109
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,669
and then they're about 10 exclamation
points

110
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,270
%ah in the light of the overly
heavy-handed police presence and their

111
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,090
nasty scare tactics

112
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,150
going so far as to even prevent us from
walking down the street

113
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,790
I admit I was thrilled to see that
they're using in the media as their

114
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,250
source of information

115
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,009
I would dare say it was a potentially
cool source a relief for the bank was

116
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,330
Java cop

117
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,699
than anyone else see it I wish I'd taken
a photo and says

118
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,860
is all in caps cops if you're out there
give us some of your news

119
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,240
please keep the protests alive and then
another

120
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,669
10 exclamation points on okay I was this

121
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,969
this actually happen how was this true
on

122
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,860
who knows actually it's could be a great
urban legend that has now propagate

123
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,680
itself the last six years

124
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,070
but I like to believe that it was true
arm

125
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,240
because what this story does in the
reason why I'm telling it to you here

126
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,070
today

127
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,349
is that captures the shift in what I
call the affordances a digital

128
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,710
communication

129
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,500
um and what I mean by Ford's is is what
digital communication allows us to do

130
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,070
and I think that this moment captures
what I see is that shifts

131
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,419
arm from communication technology that

132
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,830
allows decentralize participation
amongst a great number of people

133
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,139
right every in the dark participate and
contribute journalism

134
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,340
to a single group up from all over the
place

135
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,900
to I'll technology that allows enables
decentralize surveillance

136
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,970
and technology that enables decentralize
surveillance

137
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:43,259
and even more importantly what I like to
call quantification on a mass scale

138
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,410
right so you go to you have this event
where you have

139
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,880
all these protesters out there you know
everywhere submitting your information

140
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,820
photos at the protest send

141
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,030
updates and sound and everything else
now on the one hand

142
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,050
and then all the sudden you see these
NYPD

143
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,090
folks show up and they're all sitting
around being like a what's gone on a

144
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,090
protest or so ago I'll check it out

145
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,360
right I think that is that is a a
important digital shifts

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,930
out that I wanna spent some time talking
about today

147
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,449
on and something also important to keep
in mind is that this shift

148
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,569
doesn't just represent a shift towards
government surveillance

149
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,190
I know this conference there is a is
there's a lot of talk to government

150
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,389
surveillance

151
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,800
arm in the ways that governments absurd
monitor

152
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,529
digital communication primarily here I'm
gonna be talking about corporate

153
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,009
surveillance

154
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,479
calm and be talking about corporate
surveillance that is

155
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,569
directed at what I call algorithmic
prediction

156
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:46,079
other words using algorithms to predict
what audience wants

157
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,509
and what an audience is going to do

158
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,500
and that is the key shift that i'm gonna
be talking about here today and I think

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,200
that is the major storyline journalism
going into to 10 2010 is a shift

160
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,730
in technology that allows decentralize
participation

161
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,070
to a shift in technology allows
corporate surveillance

162
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,170
aimed at algorithmic prediction of the
audience

163
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,839
okay and I tried to capture that shifted
the title at the stalk which I call

164
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,589
from in the media to demands media in
the media represents sort of one

165
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,700
form love what technology lets do and
Demand Media represents another former

166
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,870
what technology lets just

167
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,899
okay the nature the shift can be seen
here

168
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,330
I'll you can be seen as a shift from
technology that enables activism to

169
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,110
technology that enables exploitation

170
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,270
technology that enables politics to
algorithms

171
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,839
technology that well I'll wear you have
an internet that is base on

172
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,620
I what Clay Shirky call an internet
based on love

173
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,339
to what I would call an internet based
on low wages

174
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,279
and finally you have a chef's in

175
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,209
you know 8 organization that is
represented by its extreme poverty

176
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,660
in the media was nothing if not
perpetually broke

177
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,439
I'll as anyone who ever was involved in
a date can

178
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,510
can test %uh to the other organization
ought to be talking about Demand Media

179
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,500
which was is not only broke by

180
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,750
is potentially going to release an IP oh
this fall that could be valued at

181
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,120
anywhere as high as 1.5 billion dollars
on which would make it the largest IPOs

182
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,990
in school

183
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,430
and they don't release night feel
they'll probably be bought by cool or by

184
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,420
Yahoo

185
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,329
up for another extreme amount of money
okay so that's the ship's

186
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,089
um okay so

187
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,450
the shift begins army begins

188
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,519
sorted technology you know there's
always been decentralize participation

189
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,910
in technology right

190
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,949
decentralized sorta DIY media

191
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,910
make your own journalism all that did
not start with

192
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,730
the Internet it did not start within the
media did not start with blogs it did

193
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,140
not start with

194
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,550
any of that I am yet sorted be the media
all of that

195
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,190
has been around for a very long time a
one other things that I like to talk

196
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,930
about

197
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,350
is the Zenit Splosion on that really got
started in nineteen eighties

198
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,940
on you know the explosion that we saw in
creative media making online a late

199
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,200
1990s and early 2000's

200
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,740
was only the latest step in a dad
gradual decentralization

201
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,910
information production and I like to
argue in this is somewhat not true

202
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,100
ballots are you that

203
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,440
you know the predecessor to the home
page was busy

204
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,880
rights so you had these things called
home pages when I was in college in 1995

205
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,820
1994 everybody wanted their own home
page

206
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,589
water with people making before they
made home pages they're making zines

207
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:49,060
who hears her zines no sabia probably
yeah that's what I thought

208
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,750
and arm béla calm in a couple days ago
said you know Chris make sure you talk

209
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,519
about some the hacker scene so

210
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,790
but she mentioned that to me I ran home
in and learn a lot about hacker zines

211
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,110
on see you all know about hack you know
you all know about this probably so if

212
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,940
you've read

213
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,510
something called frack I just started
reading it on the other day this is

214
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,860
actually can't really see it but this is
the the

215
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,870
inaugural edition of frack I also had
things call for a hex on line the first

216
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,800
amendment spell the pH

217
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,850
are the brotherhood of war as and of
course everyone's favorite sub

218
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,440
sorta not really seen but a magazine yet
2600

219
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,450
%uh so

220
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,220
this first trend towards decentralized
to yourself information production

221
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,040
didn't begin with the Internet and it
didn't begin with

222
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,160
in the media arm but you know I would
argue that

223
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,800
on Indymedia the emergence and in the
media in 1999

224
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,260
representative represented a qualitative
shifts

225
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,519
a major step forward in decentralize
publish

226
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,610
I'll and it was a major step forward and
decentralize publishing because it

227
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,370
brought

228
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,810
a lot of different threads together that
were going on in media

229
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,490
that were going on in politics and that
were going on in tech

230
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,800
on and I like to talk about how in the
media's community when it first began in

231
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,089
1999

232
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,300
was made up a sore three groups the
first group

233
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,250
was a group with canopy free digital
community media makers

234
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,390
arm and these pre digital community
media makers or groups like paper tiger

235
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,089
television

236
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,860
the Manhattan neighborhood network has
anybody here heard a paper tiger TV

237
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,760
somebody had paper tiger TV was aight
was a video collective in the nineteen

238
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,730
eighties

239
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,200
predated the Internet that on you worked
on

240
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,010
producing TV shows and specials I

241
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,550
and you know they were big and sort of
the open yet the

242
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,730
video movement I am paper cheap paper
tiger TV representatives from paper

243
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,930
tiger TV

244
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,149
the Manhattan neighborhood network they
were involved in the

245
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,120
early days a kind of planning what they
wanted this in the media thing to be

246
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,839
and because they had always made media
their idea was alright we want something

247
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,680
that can cover activism in cover
politics

248
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,740
from the point of view are the people
who are doing

249
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,920
you know the protest that was once
trapped second strand in the late

250
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,709
nineteen nineties you obviously had this
huge explosion

251
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:21,800
in what is sorta you can call it many
things Carroll globalization movement

252
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,029
the globalization movement but the good
kinds

253
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:29,689
%ah the anti-globalization movement you
know whatever you want to call it

254
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,720
you had this sort of new political my
well

255
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,089
not new political movement you at a
political movement that been going on

256
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,850
a lot of places around the world for a
very long time that it just started sort

257
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,149
make an impact

258
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,779
in the the Global North on

259
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:50,639
ands on that sort of political strand
was emerging as well and this was a

260
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,190
political stand it was very strongly
influenced

261
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,100
are by a group I love by group in mexico
call this app it eastern

262
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,010
right so there on the one hand you have
media makers write paper tiger TV

263
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,740
Manhattan neighborhood network that were
involved a lot of

264
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,639
ob sir journalism and media making
activities in the nineteen eighties

265
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,560
and into the nineteen nineties right you
out on the other hand you had this

266
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,769
this sort of political emergence love

267
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:20,930
on this new social movement that was
strongly influenced by

268
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,829
cattle localization and iOS app it he
says they were involved in these early

269
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:29,820
planning meetings to create in the media
and the third

270
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,899
our group which is the group you all
probably know the most about

271
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,959
arm is what I like to call the
politically oriented hacker community

272
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,290
I'll which of course is only a small
subset

273
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,439
up the larger after community right
because not every hacker cares about

274
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,300
politics

275
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,709
certainly not every after what identify
themselves with you know

276
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:52,290
these other two strands that I talked
about but certainly there were some

277
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,589
up there were some people who would are
and so the third strand

278
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,990
this um is what I call the politically
oriented

279
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,339
hacker community on and particularly a
group of

280
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,070
I like but I call coder activists on who
are affiliated with the community

281
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,149
activists

282
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,889
Technology Network in Sydney Australia

283
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,990
and then again the name here's community
activist Technology Sydney Australia

284
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,010
they're also called catalysts

285
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,889
anybody here ever heard a catalyst
catalysts are those where this all

286
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:24,110
starts

287
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,260
arm and the folks at Catalyst

288
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,250
had this idea that actually started
because the folks a catalyst wanted to

289
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,740
figure out a way that they could create
an online calendar

290
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,880
right they want to create an online
calendar and they were tired of having

291
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,250
to photocopy their calendars

292
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,440
every time they wanted people to know
what was going on so wanted to create an

293
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,699
online calendar and then they figured
well look at work and create an online

294
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:48,630
calendar

295
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,920
wanna come up with a way that said
sharing what's gonna happen

296
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,220
you know 10 days from now we can
actually share what happens

297
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,240
yesterday or we can share what happened

298
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,230
five minutes ago and hey we've got the
internet now we can do this

299
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,240
right we can find a way to share
information

300
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,309
about what's happening right now on

301
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:12,959
and this was the idea of a fox at
Catalyst and

302
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,760
you can see right here um this is
actually the g8 18 Sidney webcast in

303
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,569
this is one that this was the debut

304
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,129
love a software called active I'm from
the best I'm aware this was the first

305
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,970
time

306
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,989
that this type ult real time software
was used in documenting the political

307
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:34,809
protest it was not called in the media
then it was called Sydney active

308
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,759
but if any of you have seen and in the
media website you can sort of see

309
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,309
the origins have it here right you've
got

310
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,239
said the list of things going down like
that you've got a list of things which

311
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,840
are kinda going across the screen

312
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,279
right but you can see that things like
Ryan van

313
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,609
right by Simon rumble 6:37 p.m. Tuesday
June 22nd 1999

314
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,739
I don't know about you but having
wannabes around makes me feel less safe

315
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:01,210
now

316
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,239
more right any sort of

317
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,559
updates Ron across the page

318
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,918
and this was june eighteenth nineteen
ninety-nine

319
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,529
up okay so what was new and and this is
that this is the the page in this is the

320
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,609
software

321
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:20,899
that would eventually a couple months go
on to become the mead

322
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,190
okay so what was new about this what was
new

323
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,840
a couple things the main thing that was
new is that it happened in real time

324
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,639
that was the huge breakthrough that was
new about about the active software

325
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,309
which these guys in

326
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:38,580
with in Sydney created I'll and this guy
andrew Nicholson

327
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,928
who at the time was a member of catalyst
in Sydney

328
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:46,100
on hero recently he was sorta talking
exciting even interview

329
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,109
with for this overview of what was
happening on inning immediate the time

330
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:51,470
he wrote recently that

331
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,929
on the breakthrough active which was the
coating which was the software

332
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:59,080
was at activist could share information
in near-real-time

333
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,489
right so instead updating what happens
you know

334
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:07,330
at the end of the day and you try to
collect all the information is a heads

335
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,460
what happened today

336
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,679
somebody sitting on they'll you know
computer some work it's a

337
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,049
this what happened five minutes ago and
I get uploaded

338
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:18,779
immediately so active allows for
updating

339
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,259
about what's going on in real time
second thing that was new

340
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,999
it was radically participatory anyone
anywhere could upload

341
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,049
right you can login into the login you
could you could

342
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,879
up you could put the page up and and and
share

343
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:39,220
what was going on right and that is

344
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,070
that is different than what had existed
before

345
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,379
primarily on the net you had email serve
group

346
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,369
up chat groups that were certain limited
in terms of who was actually

347
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,959
participating right

348
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,289
the idea here was that anybody could
could participate

349
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:59,619
um the third thing that was new was that

350
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:04,459
the stuff that in the media was covering
was concerned with what I call public

351
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,100
issues in a new way right the people who
were documenting this stuff we're

352
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,799
concerned about politics

353
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,429
they're concerned about politics and
they were theoretically

354
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,649
gearing their coverage toward everybody

355
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:21,710
they're saying look this is politics you
should

356
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,269
all be interested in what's going on
here this affects

357
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,840
olive you right this little story here
about

358
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,320
this riot van people who uploaded this
story said they said

359
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,059
this relates to every single one of you
this is political

360
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,678
because its political it impacts
everyone on and it was

361
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,049
not geared towards for example a
particular scene community

362
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,869
right so there's E-world you had a very
strong sense of this is my audience is

363
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,340
this is one targeting

364
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,580
this so I think cares about this it was
not similar

365
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,689
quien in so far as you were saying look
here they're saying everybody should

366
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,450
care about this this is for everyone

367
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,940
everyone that are participating everyone
should care

368
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,379
and when you bring these three things
together right real time

369
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:06,590
radically participatory concerned with
public issues

370
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,009
what you basically have as you have a
hacker journalism

371
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,129
you have now haps journalism at a pretty
fundamental way

372
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:16,009
because what is journalism care about
journalism tells everyone that cares

373
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,749
about the public right

374
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:21,259
it says that reporters the ones you
bring you the information in real time

375
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:21,999
right

376
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:26,690
is there there and you're not and they
said only a few people can do it

377
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,669
seen you bring these three strands
together you're not just packing the

378
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,070
media acting journalism

379
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,139
and this is it I would argue a
significant change in significant

380
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:38,700
development

381
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,759
and this is just a long quote here that
i think is useful

382
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,009
on this is from a reason overview in the
media as anniversary that got put out in

383
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,779
February 2010

384
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:51,340
it basically says I is I'd call it the
emergence that the participatory web the

385
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,099
quote is

386
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:55,210
for nicholson this guy in Sydney I
talked about who who was

387
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,749
we did this along with another guy
Matthew aronson on these routes are the

388
00:21:58,749 --> 00:21:59,440
two

389
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,440
hackers and Sydney invented the software

390
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,899
on for nicholson the first in the media
site uniquely brought together the

391
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:07,979
hacker systems and communication

392
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:11,539
which is developed in the early days at
the BBS any ARPANET

393
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,940
with an expanding counter the
localization movement and its non-expert

394
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,739
adherence

395
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:19,289
enthusiasts the interactive elements
which were some novel in the in the

396
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,119
media site had a long history

397
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,149
in a smaller base at the open source
community a programmer's

398
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:27,590
were writing web sites for other
programmers and were used to using the

399
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,470
most advanced technologies at the time

400
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,649
to rate improve those programs says the
guy who

401
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:36,450
help develop the software and he is
pointing to up

402
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,229
he is pointing to the relationship here
between what the hacker community was

403
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,989
doing

404
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:44,450
and then what they tried to bring into
this new form germs

405
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,570
okay fast forward 10 years

406
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,460
here we are right this is everywhere

407
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,119
what was new and unique and radical in
1999

408
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,799
is now I mean like this is Twitter right

409
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,499
from the tehran Bureau and we've all
heard the stories right

410
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:06,179
Iranian activists using Twitter et
cetera et cetera

411
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,259
Hillary Clinton the state department
does a Twitter and says hey please don't

412
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,799
shut your site down

413
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,918
for maintenance these activists in Iran
are using this technology and a new

414
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,769
way rate so there has been a mainstream
is Asian

415
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:25,519
up this this has now been mainstream

416
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,749
to sort an incredible degree and I call
this the ubiquity of web 2.0

417
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:33,210
which is a term I hate actually but sort
of using

418
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,960
their own names to describe how they
like to call them sell you know what

419
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,009
they like to call themselves the sorta
ubiquity and web 2.0

420
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:45,669
and what was once Avon guards

421
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:49,279
is now nicely branded with the scene a
little bird

422
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,460
right in its light blue very this is is

423
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,099
black background right Twitter light
blue

424
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,549
right me the collars tells a story here
um

425
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,830
okay the ubiquity of web 2.0 protest me

426
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,408
so the next step or sort of the
character and or the thing that's

427
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,779
happening on the side that's really big
and important that not many people are

428
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:12,599
talking about

429
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:17,509
in these sorts of rooms what I like to
call from in the media to demand me

430
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:20,879
and I'm gonna tell you now there'll be
about this thing demand me

431
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:26,059
um Demand Media is a large company that
was created in 2006

432
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:30,559
%ah by a former sorta venture
capitalists name Sean coehlo

433
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,928
he was a principal in the private equity
industry and this

434
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,940
other guy Richard Rosenblatt who is the
former chairman

435
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,570
myspace top cop and they came together
in 2006 and they said hey I've got a new

436
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,099
idea for a media company

437
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:47,099
think this could be really any um what
does

438
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:51,099
Demand Media do Demand Media I am

439
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:55,468
basically creates online content and
online journalism

440
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:58,979
based on a combination of measuring
consumer demands

441
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:02,190
and predicted return on investment

442
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,999
and and what that all means something to
talk about in a sec

443
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:09,320
on but this is sort of the new way

444
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,840
that these entrepreneurs in his race
every businessman it decided you know

445
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,749
what forget

446
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:17,840
this everybody's doing this what's
really important

447
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,109
is this new thing this new model and if
the

448
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:24,340
it's the sound is working I'm gonna try

449
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,949
to load up a brief video

450
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:34,679
have them talking about it let's see if
this works

451
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,700
and it may not be

452
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,649
I do not think it it's okay

453
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,919
if that's alright I can explain US
anyway I'm usually is gonna look at this

454
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,820
guy right this is Steven kid

455
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,070
he is the CEO of up Demand Media om

456
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,168
I do have a problem but but that's okay
really i mean

467
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:38,349
I am slideshow started again

468
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:42,519
okay so a total over about what in the
media did

469
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,590
on talk about what Demand Media does
okay

470
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,580
what is the man media do like I said it
he creates online content

471
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,559
based on a combination have measured
consumer demand and predicted return on

472
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,668
investment

473
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:59,090
up basically Demand Media employees and
army

474
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,099
a freelancers and their army a free
minute freelancers is particularly large

475
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:08,129
why who's getting laid off right now in
the media world

476
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:12,700
journalists yes they have a huge army
freelancers largely because nobody wants

477
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,789
to do journalism can find a job they're
all getting by

478
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,239
so he's got a large talent pool to draw
from

479
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:22,859
they employ a army freelancers in late
of journalists

480
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,330
um so the they employ multiple

481
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,158
algorithms when they're deciding what
content they want this army a freelance

482
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,259
journalists

483
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:36,669
to make arm they monitor search engine
query data

484
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:39,849
and then monitor bids on advertising
auctions

485
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:43,710
so they have an algorithm that monitors
what people are looking for on Google

486
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,169
and they also have an algorithm that
monitors how

487
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:51,269
on you notes and space is being
auctioned off price how much is ad space

488
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,339
on the front page the New York Times
going for

489
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,869
how much is this space going for and
water people searching for

490
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:01,529
right where people trying to find on the
web so that's those are two algorithms

491
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:05,629
on and from these rights you figure out
what people are searching for

492
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:09,089
and you figure out how much advertising
space is going from

493
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:13,519
from these potential article topics are
generated

494
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,719
right so all the sudden a thousand
people

495
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:20,960
on you know say they've been to hoping
all the sudden

496
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,809
thousand people I just learned about how
to hack your GPS

497
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:30,549
on everybody starts typing into Google
how to hack your GPS really quickly

498
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,950
Demand Media finds that they know that's
going on

499
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,099
and then they will say hey maybe we need
a short

500
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:40,950
500 word article how to hack your GPS

501
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,509
right because they're monitored that
this is actually something that's

502
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:44,769
happening on the internet

503
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:48,219
and then what they do is all they

504
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:53,509
use a second algorithm to determine how
much money dis article could make

505
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:57,729
right so they say if we create this
article

506
00:28:57,729 --> 00:29:01,440
how much money is it going to make for
us based on how much

507
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,129
based on a lot of things I think they
crunch all these numbers together and

508
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:04,739
they say

509
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:08,899
how much for you now to this article how
much money for this article make

510
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:13,399
and then they say they use a third
algorithm to try to farm this article

511
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,599
out to their army of freelancers

512
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,489
right they have their database for
freelancers the a third algorithm and

513
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,159
they say

514
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,159
okay XYZ and a people

515
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,739
would be really good to write this
article and based on how much money it

516
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:26,379
would make

517
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:29,859
we're gonna know exactly how much to pay
them

518
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:33,710
right we're gonna no to that to the
sense how much this article is worth

519
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,809
so they know exactly how much this
article's gonna be worth they know

520
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,639
exactly who can write it

521
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:41,859
and they know exactly how much to pay
them so they can make the most money

522
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:44,210
that they possibly can

523
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,859
write the article has been farmed out to
one of the thousands a free lancer is

524
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,899
employed by Demand Media

525
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:53,129
to take on the assignment and generate a
story

526
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:57,330
loaded with SEO keywords search engine
optimization keywords

527
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,330
and all get to that in a second it's
actually kind of amazing

528
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,139
on Demand Media publishes seven thousand
articles day

529
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:08,729
and their other companies there's
another one called Associated Content

530
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:12,019
summit talk about a minute they
published I think twenty or thirty

531
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,609
thousand articles today

532
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:19,359
a day um if you're one of the people was
lucky enough to

533
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,519
work for one of these companies I your
compensation is between three dollars

534
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,820
and thirty dollars an article

535
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,700
unusually the average price is about six
dollars per article

536
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,149
so you can make fifty dollars a day if
you churn out

537
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:37,269
you know 10 articles 50 bucks

538
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,089
alright what is this content look like
this is this is

539
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,999
almost beautiful really I I don't know
if you can read this but the title of

540
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,889
this article is by Associated Content
it's not by Demand Media but

541
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,289
is the same same up typeof company

542
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:57,229
and the title this article is Speed
Stick must deodorants

543
00:30:57,229 --> 00:31:00,469
product review okay

544
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:03,659
obviously they monitor that somebody was
was looking

545
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,469
you know how good is Speed Stick must
deodorant I'll

546
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:11,769
maybe we should do a product review is
what it says it says

547
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:16,019
as I was browsing the articles on our
local CVS drugstore

548
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,259
I noticed several deodorants with eighty
percent of

549
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:24,429
one of them was a hefty size speed stick
by men in

550
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,789
the real tell price was four dollars in
nineteen sense

551
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:31,169
and it was discounted by two dollars and
39 cents

552
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:35,089
making my cost just 80 cents right first
of all that's wrong

553
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:39,589
the cost was a dollar an 80 cents making
my cost just 80 cents

554
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:44,589
I figured this big guy was twice the
size of the area deodorant I often

555
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:45,609
purchase okay

556
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:50,529
what's a key word there this big guy was
twice the size

557
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:53,659
right this big I was twice the size

558
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:56,899
rare it is this big guy was twice the
size

559
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:00,739
why else would you write something so
totally mara doesn't even make sense

560
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:03,759
that's not that's barely English Friday

561
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,959
when you get in there this big guy is
twice the size

562
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:10,909
it goes on did you order is made for
eight years again

563
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:14,999
your it is made for a guys big hands

564
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,200
but my smaller hand was able to hold it
it is really needs

565
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,950
because it has black grips on both the
sides

566
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,080
the front and back our way with the logo
in black and white

567
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,609
on white bronze and black backgrounds

568
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:34,039
the top of the deodorant is a clear
plastic is now

569
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:37,519
the top of the order is a clear bronze
plastic

570
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,419
on this state's quote smells great

571
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:46,659
all day it goes on

572
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:50,440
I lifted off the top of the order and
there was a clear Pratt plastic

573
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,279
protector on it

574
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,139
okay I pull this off to show the
deodorant

575
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:59,950
which was a clear solid see-through
products

576
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:05,989
them the muck them the musk smell was
very refreshing and not over the top

577
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:09,580
some love them oh and here's your final
keyword I think

578
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,349
sum up the men's deodorants were just
too strong a

579
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:17,149
a fragrance for me to try out semana

580
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:21,190
big too big too strong black

581
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,279
handle on both sides rubber

582
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,299
right what is this this is porn right

583
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,690
I mean this is this is Speed Stick
reviews disguised as pathetic

584
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,859
pornography I am

585
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:40,950
and and this is getting churned out like
a setter to rate over some companies

586
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,339
seven thousand other companies 20,000 a
day

587
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:49,479
and who's doing them some combination of
human beings and machines

588
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:52,649
right what you've really got going on
here is this this

589
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:55,859
hybrid of human beings and machines
right said

590
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:59,609
anyone who wants to learn anything about
speed stick deodorant

591
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:03,289
right you type in how good is speed
stick %ah

592
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:07,259
muscular and right people type this
stuff and that's the thing people look

593
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:10,250
up stuff like this all the time

594
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,260
any idea is that this is going to be at
the top I love your search engine

595
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,359
results when you type this

596
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,399
ok act so here's how I want to frame the
shift in

597
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,598
start to head towards wrapping up here

598
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,929
um this is the ship so you know and I
guess that these are the only things

599
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,490
going on line

600
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,490
these are what I'm I call you know kinda
by deal types right

601
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,190
in the median Demand Media ideal types
they just sorta represent bigger trend

602
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,918
so you shouldn't assume

603
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,089
that this is the only meaningful thing
going on in journalism but these are

604
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:47,500
trends and they are represented by these
two organizations

605
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,779
on they may be a who was a participant

606
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:54,960
right participation was activists
primarily people who were passionate

607
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,418
about politics

608
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:00,308
people who deeply cared about these very

Media the opportunities are endless

619
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,650

that I mention earlier

620
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,779
on Demand Media who's your who's your
pages meant

621
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:45,029
mir leid of journalists um who

622
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:49,849
who seconding who's your core the people
you're aiming your product at

623
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,289
who's your community who are you trying
to Beach arm

624
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:56,420
for in the media you're trying to reach
and engage community right

625
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,470
you're trying to reach all those people
out there like you

626
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,450
those people out there like you who
really care about these topics

627
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,500
really care about these politics who for
one reason or another are passionate

628
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,170
about this

629
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,390
this thing right whether it's the world
trade organization or whether it's

630
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,019
community gardens in New York City or
you know whatever it is that those are

631
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:19,410
the people you're trying to reach

632
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,629
who are you trying to reach with
assorted Demand Media idea but the man

633
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,430
who you're trying to reach the
algorithmic

634
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,109
web right that is your public

635
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:33,049
your public it's not really even people
anymore write your public

636
00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:36,549
is sort of these mashed together
algorithms

637
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:40,240
Google people keyword searches

638
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,760
SEO optimization right its almost hard
to talk about these things

639
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,029
as if their people right there all these
things sort of mush together

640
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:51,869
rights Eve got this just public that's
kinda generated

641
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:56,349
out at this algorithm right who's the
idea what's the idea what you're trying

642
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:57,079
to reach

643
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,309
it sorted this this human soup

644
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:04,180
right that's been moshe together from
all these things

645
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,839
are and one can sort of quibble with
that in a lot of ways

646
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,490
you know I'm sorta being extreme in my
generalizations here but

647
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:15,059
you know I think that their is when you
compare these two things you see a real

648
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,279
difference between

649
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:21,160
the idea trying to reach and engage
community activists and trying to reach

650
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,269
tube random million people a day type in
a keyword search for Speed Stick must be

651
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:28,170
other

652
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,710
okay um

653
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,900
the politics I am well

654
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,079
the politics for in the media are
obviously radical

655
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:42,660
and you can certainly apply radical
politics to too many things I mean right

656
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,348
you can

657
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:46,950
in the LSU easy to talk about the Daily
Kos you can talk about

658
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,109
up a lot of the lessor lefty liberal
blogs raved about the conservative blog

659
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,910
slot I like the conservative blogs a
helluva lot better than I do you demand

660
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,269
me because at least

661
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:58,539
their people who care right

662
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:02,369
that's who you're trying to reach with
this what your politics none I mean on

663
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:05,980
there's there's well yeah right

664
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,589
Kappa capitalism in it really stupid way

665
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:13,250
I mean capitalism in the most sort have
been alway

666
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,529
possible

667
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:20,390
we will we will we will get to this in a
manner I'm I

668
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,180
I'm almost done arm alright and

669
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,038
what's the paradigm here the paradigm in
the media's agonistic

670
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,410
the paradigm with them and media is what
I call algorithmic right by agonistic I

671
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,049
mean

672
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:37,000
people who want to participate in sort
of fight back

673
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,059
mamita politics is the algorithm so

674
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:44,809
before I conclude I just wanna say you
know what are we

675
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:48,930
what are we looking at here we're
looking at this transition from

676
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,220
a dominant journalistic paradigm where

677
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,220
media creation is based on love right

678
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,819
in some ways love whatcha covering

679
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:02,980
love the people you're trying to reach
love in the way that you care so much

680
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,559
about you are willing to do it for free

681
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,150
right that sort it exists

682
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,510
was IA yesterday tangential to
exploitation

683
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,089
right at me look at this this is flyer
from 1999 this is nothing if not

684
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,430
know based on some for sort of love

685
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,799
right and then there's this guy

686
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:30,640
so I just want to conclude by saying
that I think

687
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,990
this as in is an importance and in this

688
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,029
community and in the community of people
who are doing

689
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:43,019
this former radical media production
this is an on acknowledged chefs that

690
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,410
you speak knowledge

691
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,490
because in the boardrooms of journalism
right now

692
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,010
people are not talking about this there
aren't even talking

693
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,220
about this they don't care about this

694
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,900
this is not important to them what's
important to them

695
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,869
is this ya who bought Associated Content
a couple months ago for someone told

696
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,230
millions of dollars you know the company
that made this

697
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,980
was bought by Yahoo for a giant sack up
money

698
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,670
USA Today is sort of taking it stories

699
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,180
about travel from this guy right the
dominant trend in journalism

700
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:23,680
is not about this it's not about this

701
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,279
it's about this so before we get to you
know before we congratulate ourselves

702
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:33,150
too much about the fact that we have had
all the successes with things like this

703
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,210
I think we really need to think about as
people who are you know

704
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,529
participating in the world is for a
technology

705
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:42,609
and media and activism I

706
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,720
you know what do we do about this guy

707
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,740
what relevance does this guy sort of
have to us

708
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,019
and with that I want to conclude I wanna
you so it's

709
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:56,319
11:43 so that fifteen minutes for
questions I love the talk

710
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:03,319
got a mic there to make up front so
thank you very much

711
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,760
and back and you can see if you wanna
say a name or anything

712
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,109
beforehand that though hello blue live
thank you

713
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:16,140
on yes my name's Ian

714
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,710
and I really enjoyed the talk and

715
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,810
I was yeah I actually was part of the

716
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,230
imagine festival that ran during the RNC

717
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,369
so yeah on

718
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:34,180
and we love you guys on I guess my
question

719
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,440
is so we have the porn you know the man

720
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,930
there be a fairly mass porn article so
the idea

721
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,200
just so I'm clear on maybe this is
obvious

722
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,180
is that people searching for porn which
people tend to do

723
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,290
probably more than anything else is we
no on

724
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:55,170
hit on that article and get exposed to
the advertising is that the idea yet

725
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:55,619
okay

726
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:59,330
just want to be clear get that okay
thanks minutes

727
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,140
you know it's really like how you know
back in the day is a free Google you

728
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,270
were just load your site up with you
know Britney Spears clock crotch shot

729
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,609
right

730
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,740
that would be the text on the entire
page and I would be like a blinking

731
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,220
saw an ad in the corner it's sorta the
Google eyes to quit 12

732
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,970
that us cool Chris this is great as
really excited a doctor and use

733
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,320

734
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,010
thank you doctor henderson on little
mutual

735
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:28,080
first time on so I I love hearing about
them immediately to get you need to show

736
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,910
talk about that

737
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,170
and this is just fascinating what
they're doing I'm sorta wondering I

738
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,890
hadn't heard a lot of pages like that

739
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,589
past years have been trawling nether
regions the internet and I I can't help

740
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:40,170
but wonder like in terms of page rank
which

741
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,750
I feel like it's sorta want the main
currencies these days how sites like

742
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,000
that

743
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,980
actually do I'm also not sure it means I
thought disorder ready for audiences a

744
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,730
people

745
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,089
running into you know the stuff that
might end up

746
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:55,130
New York Times versus the substance
appears to be any thoughts on that

747
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:00,330
um that is a that's a great question on
I think what what Demand Media says they

748
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,549
will be doing

749
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,349
but that what they say they're doing
with regard to page rank as they say

750
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:04,890
they're

751
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:09,160
their hitting what they call the long
tail of the web rights if you look up

752
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,740
deodorant that page may not come up very
high

753
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,240
but if your Google query is up you know

754
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,960
I want a product review Speed Stick

755
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,780
musk deodorant this that page is
definitely gonna shower

756
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:29,220
right and think about how you're using
Google a lot of people are using Google

757
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,430
more and more

758
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,080
to type in these very long phrases a lot
of times in quotes right think about

759
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,060
your own Google use probably

760
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,779
you yourself for doing this more and
more right you want to find exactly what

761
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,180
is your looking for so you're no longer
typing in

762
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,549
you know Speed Stick your typing and you
know how good a product is musk

763
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,220
deodorant

764
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,510
and right yes direction for pressure

765
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,270
by so that that's that's their sweet
spot and and that so yeah

766
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,380
and in the in the world is or the front
and world the page rank

767
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,460
arm you know where the sort of you know

768
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,160
safe amino generalizable love search
query show up

769
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,649
this is probably not coming up that high
but again what they call the long tail

770
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,770
at the Internet out this is Shana

771
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,740
ahead back hi I'm Jamie from the first
people in

772
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,900
hey Jimmy I really appreciated the
contrast between

773
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,800
in the media and Demand Media and
learned a lot about Demand Media

774
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,070
I'm and I also understand from what you
said that transition

775
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:34,280
from Twitter Facebook

776
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,290
and and you too to Demand Media

777
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,920
rate I'm not following why you're
calling it a transition from

778
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,250
in the media to demand me to Demand
Media and assigned him

779
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,760
in the media I'd be really interested in
me what you think that

780
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,500
transition from the media is going to in
the sense have

781
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,720
in the media is politics is that saddam
interested track

782
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,099
more than anything else yeah I mean you
know in some ways there

783
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:02,910
you know it's its its this is a good
question is are the thing that I

784
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,509
struggled with the most I was praying
this talk together

785
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,339
because in some ways it's not a transit
its not one goes to the other

786
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,440
right so it's not like all of a sudden
all these cool hackers who were doing in

787
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,430
the media work

788
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,319
1999 are now sitting in in rosenblatts

789
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,960
you know room in there now you know
creating Demand Media

790
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,550
that that is definitely not happening so
in some ways that the transition is not

791
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:29,089
organizational arm the transition

792
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:34,609
is the sort of spirit of the age

793
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:38,810
to not get too highfalutin about it by
you know it's the sort of

794
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,049
the dominant most important thing that's
happening online

795
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,440
and I would say that in my eyes or two
from my observations

796
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,710
it sorta dominate most important thing
that's happening online

797
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,099
has gone from sort of like I said
decentralize participation

798
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:56,580
sort of centralized algorithmic
surveillance

799
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,000
arm so you know now that said I think
that

800
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,130
for many many reasons you know which

801
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:07,890
are two sort of fraud and complicated to
get into here

802
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,029
I think that in the media is not as
strong as it once was

803
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,369
I'm certainly I I think that you know
many of these sort of radical media

804
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,730
projects are not as strong as they once
were

805
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,589
partly because they're sort of their
energy has been absorbed into Twitter

806
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:22,859
and Facebook in this

807
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:26,410
sorta more friendly web 2.0 environments

808
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,799
arm so you know I think that there you
know while the the people or the

809
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,500
organization may not have been making a
transition from any immediate to Demand

810
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,230
Media

811
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:39,220
arm the spear to protests and Sourav

812
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,550
participation have like you said moved
into web 2.0

813
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,080
and the the potential of the Internet

814
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,319
is now being realized in this sort of
totally different other things

815
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,390
you know so in the media is sorted
exactly right enemy is exactly what's

816
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,098
always been

817
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:58,910
here it is right got this this

818
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,759
third just like sliver of the Internet
read it just so happens that the

819
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,810
Internet is now

820
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,220
here now as opposed to hear its

821
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,640
here and what's going all over here
especially financially

822
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,098
is is this thing so

823
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,440
does not a great answer I will admit but

824
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,670
enough but okay so

825
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,380
you know so that the whole I me know
that so the hope

826
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,460
is you know what Juliana solzhenitsyn
people are doing i think i mean we

827
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,010
shouldn't think that

828
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:36,599
you know what we need are we need new
radical projects

829
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,750
arm that will break through right we
need

830
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:44,160
the kind of thing that these guys and
Sydney were doing in the nineteen you

831
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,520
know 1998 1999

832
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,599
right that's that's the stuff that we
were never gonna

833
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,380
we're never gonna take that space back
from the skies were never gonna

834
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,609
take it back from them but we can build
a new things that will

835
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:01,490
get people excited again I guess that's
what I mean right we need new

836
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:05,170
stuff new projects and organizations new
people

837
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:09,140
who'll get people excited again on it
maybe not in the same way but

838
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,470
but in a new way om you know and

839
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,650
and in some ways that's your job

840
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,790
I'll yeah that's it for any pressure on
you by

841
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,759
now I'll we need people to get involved
into you know not let this be the only

842
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,910
thing out there

843
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:29,060
kinda in a similar vein to the
gentleman's question don't you feel that

844
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,700
the growth

845
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,190
things like Demand Media is probably
caused by the

846
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,069
relative growth up the internet from
hobbyist

847
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:40,849
sort novelty more minutes s these days
obviously a lot more people are

848
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:41,950
connected

849
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,700
that's why we have a lot more sell
people on the net

850
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,440
just to put it yep in that regard I
don't think there's really a threat to

851
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,180
people again

852
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,190
in the media because the audience is
still there its pretty much the same

853
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:54,630
thing

854
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,390
I don't think sites again in the media
generate as many those people

855
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,470
as it is that they provide to an
audience that already exists and the

856
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,819
same goes for Demand Media

857
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,849
here's I I think I'm one level that's
true

858
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:08,970
I I think the way it's not true is that

859
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,099
you know here's the thing Demand Media
is not

860
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:15,710
a aid mirror love the way people are

861
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,750
right demand so it's not like you've got
people and then their own sort of

862
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,849
shallow banality shows up

863
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:25,900
India I mean summer that happens right
but

864
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,910
this creates a certain kind of person

865
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,000
so it's not you know shallow people

866
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,599
flock to Demand Media it's that shallow
people

867
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,950
and that people and Demand Media Create
each other

868
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,970
right the existence of this creates

869
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:49,270
the idea of the shallow internet user
I'm still existed before Demand Media

870
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,420
and it's just now being brought to light
by its existence yeah I mean in some

871
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,920
ways it's a philosophical question

872
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,470
right on and and you know there's no
right answer

873
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,430
I mean I you know I will

874
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,520
all I would say that I'm just a little
arm

875
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,580
we locked into say

876
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,720
that Demand Media solely mirrors the

877
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,569
the shallowness so the idiots on the web
either way fuck Demand Media

878
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:17,750
threat yes okay in the back yeah

879
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:21,000
tigress so I just have to say that the

880
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,640
this idea the ultimate audiences Demand
Media being

881
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,830
the algorithmic where is incredibly
scary Yemeni

882
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,970
because it kinda seems like especially
with that you're saying about

883
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:35,119
how these companies are being bought up
by existing big Internet companies

884
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,280
that it's like their comp saying two
things at once which are both terrible

885
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,859
their consolidating the media outlets
that people view

886
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:45,869
and fragmenting the audience to the
ultimate agrees that there's absolutely

887
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:48,430
no possibility for community

888
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,089
inside I i can. like your what do you
what do you think about that but like

889
00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:53,520
that they're stealing

890
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,650
because they're cuz they're running the
system effectively to get

891
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,710
to come up in searches are they stealing
audience from people who have something

892
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,480
more substantive

893
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,010
say about that hit his sorrow when I
think they do and I think they're

894
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:09,569
their fragmenting if they've got they've
got

895
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:12,750
arm they're doing two things
simultaneously day

896
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:17,049
our fragmenting the audience as much as
they possibly can

897
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:20,810
but then they're reuniting that audience
through this or an algorithmic much

898
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,089
maker

899
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:26,160
says right its arm you know I don't know
if they're

900
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,660
taking ya know they're taking audience
away from better

901
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,200
products but they're certainly consuming
a huge amount of money

902
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,500
arm and that's that's what you mean by

903
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,710
Demand Media make stupid people arm like

904
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,319
they take people an inmate think okay
that's yes but the neck

905
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,980
yeah I would say that's one way so
that's a little we got 2 minutes left

906
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,000
arm but I guess what we could we could
do is

907
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,369
army people just wanna so it can it can
people talk for like five seconds

908
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:58,549
at the mike okay

909
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,650
we all hang out at mars and you know it
I guess we can just have his in rather

910
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,330
than me responding at people just want
to sort of

911
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,839
say what they want to say we get through
everybody SodaHead

912
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,299
no I actually had a question I just one
of many who could subvert the techniques

913
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:17,310
of the corporate America guide to our
ends yes

914
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:22,009
the our contact page yes

915
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,569
that's me so if you stuck wish that

916
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:29,859
Demand Media calls itself journalism
hope code is ever just the fact that

917
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:33,060
sometimes things happen that we have no
idea about like people shouldn't be with

918
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,940
Nell

919
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,170
helicopters like that yeah with it okay

920
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:40,869
and that's going to have to be the last
one I sorry but like I said I'll be in

921
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:41,410
the back

922
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:45,549
on journalism still exists right because
like you said journalism

923
00:52:45,549 --> 00:52:49,180
arm they're always gonna be new things
that happen in journalism that this

924
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,150
algorithm can capture

925
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,080
arm and its well maybe there will be

926
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,270
arm by the

927
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:03,049
importance of those people in the sort
of widespread digital ecosystem

928
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:06,299
arm is going to be less and less
valuable

929
00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:09,330
would be my answer okay that's it

930
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:13,810
