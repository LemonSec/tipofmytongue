00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,450
yet okay so I will not look had

68
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,200
the year where should a me understand
backwards and just tell me if I get

69
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,330
anything wrong with it

70
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,940
um so the number should start out nine

71
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,000
5 8 6 one

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,520
one 7 to 0 8 3

73
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,000
8 to 53 0

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,040

75
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,640
9

76
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,000
and the just a prove a point that this
is actually

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,900
filed the way in my brain and basically
like mental filing cabinets

78
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,110
I'm going our site the number backwards
now starting from

79
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,350
the bottom right to left and then okay
so let me

80
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,630
attempt tell me if I mess up so it
should be backwards 9

81
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,800
0 8 arm

82
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,510
7 55

83
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,490
for 8

84
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,950
0 35

85
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,310
to 8

86
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,390
3 8 0

87
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,159
to 7 one

88
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,940
one 6 859

89
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,790
so

90
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,850
those are just a couple love quick
demonstrations to show you

91
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,780
what is possible for you if you take the
time to train your memory

92
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,000
olive you in this audience are keeping
warm doing extraordinary things with

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,690
your memory

94
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,830
are you just need to be taught how to do
it

95
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,049
um before I get into the exercise by the
way it's going to be a very interactive

96
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,809
presentation today quite different from
the presentations i've seen earlier I'm

97
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,370
going there

98
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,410
actually have you as an audience
memorize a lot of things and

99
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,990
recall them hopefully I'll find this to
be fun

100
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,670
as well as educational um quick little
background

101
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,160

memory championship while there many

102
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,949
different events

103

memorize the 132 digit sequence

107
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,240
computer-generated random digits only
five minutes and was able to repeat it

108
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,210
forwards and backwards is no mistakes

109
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,580

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,579
I memorize the 50 line home in about 15
minutes

113
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,180
I those are some other things that I did
in order to win

114
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,600
the national memory championship so

115
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,270

116
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,250
now we are going to get into the
exercises for you

117
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,560
so that you can all do some amazing
things with their memory today

118
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,170
I I wanna say up front that a lot of
what I ask you to do today may seem a

119
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,160
bit silly

120
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,350
but just bear with me because I promise
you

121
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,320
that it will help you to improve your
memory I so I'd like for everyone to

122
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,590
close their eyes and i want for you

123
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,940
to just do your best to a magic what I
described to you

124
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,740
do your best to picture what I describe
to you and see it happening

125
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,020
in your mind this is a warmup
visualization exercise we're going to do

126
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,270
so i want for you all to imagine that
you

127
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,010
walk into your residence the place that
you live imagine

128
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,080
that you're walking into the living room

129
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,900
area of your residence I and the Middle
love your living room you see there

130
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,260
standing behind podiums Barack Obama

131
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,450
and John McCain K for Obama and John
McCain are standing in the middle of

132
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,100
your living room

133
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,950
and they look as if they're are about to
debate now this seems rather strange to

134
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,530
you

135
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,140
but instead of asking any questions you
decide to just hang back and observe

136
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,890
what's going on

137
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,199
okay so they begin to the bait pictures
as best you can they begin to debate

138
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,140
and you notice that the the bay appears
to become more and more heated

139
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,600
and became visibly becomes very upset at
something that Obama says

140
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,850
and he reaches behind his podium and he
pulls out

141
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,709
a pie okay he pulls out a pie

142
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,770
he takes this hi any throws up a rock

143
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,010
and Brock now has pie splattered all
over his face

144
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,020
its do your best picture that

145
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,720
now Obama's pretty upset by this so
believe it or not

146
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,380
he reaches behind his podium also pulls
out a pie

147
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,810
takes it throws that McCain and
apparently Obama has pretty good name as

148
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,490
well cuz

149
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,990
mccain now has pie splattered all over
his face

150
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,170
steer best picture that now

151
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,060
what was once the debate has turned into
a full-blown

152
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,400
Pi Phi and the politicians are
continuously

153
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,500
throwing pies that each other just your
best picture that now if the imagery

154
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,970
is it crystal clear that doesn't really
matter just do your best to see that

155
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,780
happening in your mind

156
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,610
okay now at this point you're all
primarily experiencing

157
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,640
visual images in your mind you're seeing
that

158
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,949
hi-fi happen what I want to do now is
attempt to get even more sense is

159
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,770
involved

160
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,800
as you experience this in your mind
imagine now that you cannot only see the

161
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,620
piper happening but imagine you can hear

162
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,180
happen imagine that you can hear the
pies flying through the air

163
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,320
you can hear the pies as their
splattering all over the politicians do

164
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,730
your best to imagine hearing ap

165
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,810
okay now go ahead and and imagine that
you can even smell

166
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,970
the pie okay imagine you can smell the
Pi Phi happening

167
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,320
steer best

168
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,300
okay take it a step further now imagine
walking up to one of them

169
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,410
and imagined you take sum up I offer
their face

170
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,689
and you feel it in your hands mean he
feels or sticky

171
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,070
steer best to imagine doing that

172
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,950
okay and now go ahead and take someone
the pie

173
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,430
and put in your mouth taste the pie mum

174
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,560
of we're imagining some by the taste
pretty good

175
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,380
okay go ahead open up your eyes everyone
open up your rights

176
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,150
now that was a pretty simple exercise
right pretty simple for everyone to

177
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,050
complete

178
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:33,290
what I want you to know is that if you
were able to complete that exercise

179
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,740
than you actually have the ability to
remember anything that you want to

180
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,560
remember

181
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,320
quickly and easily and here are some
reasons why

182
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,670
reason number one I hand you exercise
your

183
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,940
visualization ability there and your
visual memory

184
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,030
is incredibly powerful example that I
always given my speeches and

185
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,050
presentations the situation

186
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,380
that we've all experienced at some point
in our life where we will see someone

187
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,480
that we may have met even years in the
past right we see them and we recognize

188
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
their face

189
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,370
we know that we met the person we know
that we met them somewhere before but no

190
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,160
matter how how hard we try

191
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,589
we can't seem to come up with the name
why is that while

192
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:16,650
when you met the person you actually saw
their face with your eyes

193
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,579
you saw the face the face was reported
and your visual memory

194
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,920
but at no point did you ever see the
name

195
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,320
that's why it's more difficult to
remember the names

196
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,630
at end of this presentation I'm going to
talk to you about how you can

197
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,200
picture names so that you are better
able to remember them

198
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,150
but for now the snow the power love your
visual memory

199
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,370
another thing to take away from the
simple exercise I had you get many of

200
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,820
your senses involved as you're
experiencing

201
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,829
that scenario happened your mind right
as you get more and more of your senses

202
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:49,380
involve

203
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,959
in the encoding process when trying to
memorize something you actually

204
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,310
activating warm or parts of the brain I
when you're

205
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,459
when activating warm or parts for the
brain you're building more more

206
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,670
connections

207
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,150
to that information he won't remember so
becomes very easy

208
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:09,439
to recall it later on a third thing to
take away from that simple exercise I

209
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:11,839
had you imagine something that was

210
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,560
a bit unusual for a is something out of
the ordinary that you wouldn't expect to

211
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,459
see every day

212
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,490
something little funny right that's
because there is a psychological aspect

213
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,890
to memory as well when we see things
happening

214
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,839
that we wouldn't ordinarily see if we
see something funny or interesting

215
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,880
happening

216
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,339
were much more likely to remember it

217
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,500
alright so now what we're going to do as
we will take

218
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,550
everything that we've learned from that
simple exercise and we will now apply it

219
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,900
to memorizing a random with the words
okay

220
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,209
the random word list is monkey iron role

221
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,670
kite house paper shoe worm and will

222
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,660
pencil River rock tree cheese and Porter

223
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,760
K that is random part its if and as
usually happens

224
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,360
I'm getting looks from people are idiots
like you know there's no way I'm gonna

225
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,020
be able that may arise at least not with
quite a lot of time

226
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,120
but in fact the wall all have that
random word list

227
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,180
perfectly memorized within a few minutes

228
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,270
okay and how you accomplish that is
again

229
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,290
you'll nearly listen to what I describe
to you

230
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,640
and just do your best picture and see
Apple in your mind okay

231
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,910
so the first word was monkey I want for
you all now to imagine

232
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,000
you see a little monkey dancing around
in your mind

233
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,829
little monkeys dancing around he's
making monkey noises who

234
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:34,709
whatever thank you that's how my this do
your best to imagine that

235
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,850
the monkeys dancing around any picks up
now I gigantic

236
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,839
ir because the next word was ir so the
monkey picks up a giant

237
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,949
I and his dancing around with the iron
okay

238
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:49,089
I am starts to fall now though and a
rope attach itself to the I am because

239
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:50,699
the next word was rope

240
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:55,130
rope attach itself to iron feel the rope
imagine feeling the role

241
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,730
you look up the role and you see that
it's attached to a kite

242
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,400
because the next over Skype you see this
kites flying around in the air it's

243
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,100
flying around in the air

244
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,059
may be tried at reach up but you can't
quite get it kites flying in the air

245
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:11,339
now you see the kite crash into the side
of the house

246
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,250
because the next one was house sleep
tight crashes in the side of the house

247
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,930
and you notice that this house is for
some strange reason

248
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,980
completely covered in paper K

249
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,120
it's completely covered in paper because
that was the next word

250
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,910
and shoe now magically appears and
starts to walk

251
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,120
all over that paper the shoe is walking
all over the paper

252
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,000
and it smells really bad for some reason
see decide investigate

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,050
and you see a little worm crawling
around inside this you because that's an

254
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,889
ex where do your best picture that

255
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,290
you see little worm crawling around
inside the shoe

256
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,340
now you see the worm jumps added the
shoe and into an

257
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,580
envelope because that was and that's
where it's a picture that

258
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,320
the worm jumps at a shoot into the
envelope

259
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,970
and a pencil now appears and starts to
write all the envelope

260
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,850
a pencil peers and starts to write all
over the envelope

261
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,139
okay now that pencil you see jumps into
the river

262
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,520
there's a huge splash inches little
pencil but it splashes really big hits

263
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,150
the river

264
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,720
as an extra was River to see that happen
the pencil those in the river

265
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,020
next the river crashes up against iraq

266
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,500
the river crashes up against the rock

267
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,670
the rock now flies out at the river and
into a tree

268
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,860
and you notice that tree is for some
strange reason growing

269
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,880
she's K

270
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,670
that's an extra cheese over some strange
reason it's going she's

271
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,240
and outta each piece of cheese shoot
supporter

272
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,610
okay at a beach peace and she issued
supporter

273
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,440
now I won't go through this again but
very very quickly

274
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,590
and as I do just do your best to play
through this store in your mind

275
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,030
to get a little monkey dancing around
picked up the giant iron a test that was

276
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,129
the rope you look up the rope attached
the kite

277
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,330
the Chi flew in the house the house is
covered in paper the shoe

278
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,720
walked all over the paper inside the
shoe was little worm crawling around the

279
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,330
world something the animal

280
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,220
a pencil appear on them look bright
pencil jumped in the river

281
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,800
the river crash into the Rock the rock
flew into the tree the tree was going

282
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,480
she's

283
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,580
and outta each piece of cheese shot I
quarter

284
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,639
K so now you should all be able to
recall that random westwards and

285
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,960
order by simply playing through the
store on your mind recalling

286
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,990
each major object that you encounter so
we will do that now as a group starting

287
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,300
with the first word which was

288
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:43,300
monte

289
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,140
excellent give ourselves a round of
applause

290
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:59,140
very nice job

291
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,870
very nice job excellent so you can see
you actually

292
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,250
capable up doing you know credible
things with your memory

293
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,720
if you learn the right techniques if you
make the most efficient use of your

294
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,220
brain

295
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,640
that first technique is that a very its

296
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,150
would you start out with with memory
improvement techniques is called the

297
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,049
story method

298
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,240
its incredibly powerful if you practice
memorizing random

299
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,760
random bits of information with the
story method you'll notice many

300
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,840
benefits overtime your memory will
improve

301
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,080
because you're exercising this memory
muscle in your brain

302
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,939
okay your visualization ability won't
prove

303
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,559
over time you'll notice that your
ability to create these

304
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,940
images in your mind one prove you're
creepy images more quickly

305
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,130
and also the imagery will become clearer
and clearer another benefit your

306
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,580
I creativity and your imagination wall
improve

307
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,809
as well I think you can already tell
this is a very good exercise

308
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:58,580
in creativity in imagination also

309
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,710
this type of thing is very good it's a
very good mental workout

310
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,960
it's very good exercise for your brain
and all the current research is showing

311
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,780
that we should try to exercise our
brains as much as possible

312
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,160
throughout our lifetimes they're showing
that your memory ability

313
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,410
does not necessarily decline due to the
aging process

314
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,480
in a bit self but rather due to the fact
that

315
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,150
our memories tend to be less challenged
later in life

316
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,559
then they were early in life some
examples they give

317
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,928
in elementary school junior high high
school college even grad school

318
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,720
you were constantly challenge to learn
cons on

319
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,179
new information from many different
areas and you had to recall the

320
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,530
information all the time for exams right

321
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,030
you're constantly exercising that memory
muscle in your brain

322
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,030
they say that when you first start a new
job

323
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,160
it's also the same thing you have to
learn tons of new things

324
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,350
and ordered and recall all those things
in order to do your job properly

325
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,600
but then what tends to happen is we
enter this twenty or thirty year period

326
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,120
where we basically do the same types of
things every day

327
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,230
even if you have a very mentally
challenging job like many

328
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,309
programmers hackers do you're still
doing the same type of thing you're not

329
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:13,330
challenging your

330
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,250
brain with many different things from
many different areas okay

331
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,179
so the good news to take from that
research is that you can actually

332
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,790
improve your memory at any age as long
as you take the time to exercise and

333
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,450
work it out

334
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,960
I they can actually I'm image the brain

335
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,740
and they can see that some people that
are much cooler and age have brains that

336
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,470
look like

337
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,390
people that are younger age and when
they interview those people they find

338
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,030
that those people who engage in lifelong
learning

339
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,240
constantly challenge our brains
throughout their life

340
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,950
okay so I wanted you I wanted to get
that point across

341
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,679
as well um as another benefit of these
types of techniques

342
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,720
now the story method is very powerful I
can mention but primarily

343
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,500
exercises the right side of your brain
which deals with creativity and

344
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,419
imagination

345
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:07,970
that's very good but the remaining
techniques that I teach

346
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,040
allow you utilize both the left and
right sides of your brain at the same

347
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,620
time to encode information

348
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,870
so then it becomes even easier to recall
it later on okay so the story methods

349
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,419
actually

350
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,130
the least powerful technique that I
teach the left side of the brain deals

351
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,480
with

352
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,990
order and logic so we are now going to
get the left side of the brain involved

353
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,600
in the encoding process

354
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,169
by learning a list of locations that we
are familiar with we're going to learn

355
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:34,610
this list the locations

356
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,299
um in an order that makes sense to us
right logic in order that's logical

357
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,460
us um this will be very easy because
locations that we

358
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,590
we will use our locations from our body
okay

359
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,699
so the first location is going to be
your left foot

360
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,740
alright the next location will be your

361
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,490
right foot the third location will be
both knees

362
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,490
after that we'll be here waste

363
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,320
just above that your belly button just
above that your chest

364
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,460
just above that your neck just above
that your mouth

365
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,480
just about that the nose and just above
that the top of your head

366
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,350
so I will go through these locations
again as I do

367
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,630
I recommend that you either we call that
body part touch that body part

368
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,580
um somehow make yourself more where that
particular body part you getting more

369
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,520
senses on wall that will help you
remember

370
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,530
remember this list so again we have left
foot

371
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,649
then right foot next both knees

372
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:42,970
then the waist then the belly button

373
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,770
then the chest then the neck and now

374
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,918
then the nose and top hat grey I like
seeing people

375
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,740
you have okay so this will be the last
time that I go through it

376
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,960
left foot right foot both knees

377
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,600
waste belly button chest

378
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,330
neck mouth knows top hat great

379
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,860
so now that we know those locations in
order

380
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,610
were we have the left side of the brain
ready to go now we will use our

381
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,899
creativity and imagination to create

382
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:20,080
images the reminders of what we want
remember and we'll link those images two

383
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,899
locations on our body to learn a new
list the words

384
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:26,460
the new random word missus Apple watch
umbrella racket

385
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,870
car football be hearing stapler and call

386
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:36,010
okay you're on that list again by nearly
concentrating on the imagery that I give

387
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:36,590
you okay

388
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,700
if you concentrate on imagery that I
give you do your best to see it

389
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,980
happening in your mind

390
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,880
then the remembering will come naturally
quickly and easily okay

391
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,990
so the first word was Apple underneath
your left foot there's this giant

392
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,940
app on anything left foot you're rolling
Apple around imagine rolling up all

393
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,950
around

394
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,460
you start to step on the Apple crunch it
okay

395
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,320
hand attached to your right foot there
is a watch

396
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,360
in the watch is ticking louder and
louder faster and faster and eventually

397
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,929
the glass part of the watch

398
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:10,590
shatters okay next

399
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,790
attached to both knees is a giant
umbrella for 1000 X word

400
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,860
and push of a button the open umbrella
in it snaps open with the really loud

401
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,899
noises

402
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:23,130
okay umbrella taxable means next

403
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,179
word racket so at your waist use yet
handle

404
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,370
you porn and oh my gosh somehow there
was a racket

405
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,100
lodged into your waz you imagine pulling
Iraq and have your waist you will

406
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,740
definitely remember it

407
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,990
okay next from your belly button you
hear you feel a rumbling coming from

408
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,520
your belly button area

409
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,590
and sounds like the car sure enough a
car shoots at a beer belly button

410
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,559
and you can see the tires spinning can
hear the engine roaring when that car

411
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:53,370
shoots at a beer belly button next
there's a football

412
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,649
football's hitting you in the chest
continuously getting in the chest

413
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:00,070
you try to stop it but no matter how
hard you try you can stop this football

414
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,850
from human chess

415
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,309
okay next word be so buzzing around your
neck is a

416
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:09,460
be you're afraid the bees gonna sting
you sure

417
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,929
be stings you in the neck

418
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:16,169
you imagine that you're definitely
remember it um

419
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:20,149
next word hearing so from your mouth you
feel pain is coming from your tongue

420
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:23,659
and oh my goodness there's enduring
attached your tongue the poll on and it

421
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,309
starts a stretch your tongue

422
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,530
when you pull on that hearing at your
town

423
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,220
next for her stapler so on top of your
nose there's a stapler

424
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,870
and its value China perfectly balanced
the stapler so its teetering back and

425
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,110
forth in your mover

426
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,760
on and to you finally get that stay per
safer perfectly balanced up even dole's

427
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,720
last word combs on popular and there's a
call me start to use the call

428
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,919
and I it starts to yank on your hair

429
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,630
okay now go through this again very very
quickly

430
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,530
underneath your left foot was a giant
Apple year old around it s your right

431
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,440
for the washing our are shattered

432
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,200
knees umbrella snapped open ways to
racking for now

433
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,750
belly button a car shot out football is
hitting you in the chest right

434
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,340
neck the beast on you now you hear hank
knows the stapler you're balancing

435
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,640
up in the head the call so now you
should all be able to recall

436
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,480
this randomness the words by merely
thinking on the locations

437
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,510
on your body in order okay so let's do
that as a group starting with the first

438
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,879
word which was

439
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:32,879
Apple

440
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,789
excite yourself around fonts

441
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:45,889
now what was here what was here

442
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:49,360
umbrella your niece I can see that waste

443
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,639
okay so what's happened here is we've
basically

444
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:57,289
created what equates to mental filing
cabinets okay

445
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:00,639
when we now nearly think the location on
our body

446
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,929
information that we stored there
automatically comes out

447
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,029
back to us okay it's like double
clicking on file you double click the

448
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,950
file the information there pops out

449
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,789
the same type of thing this is
incredibly powerful because it gives you

450
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,010
a way to organize information

451
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,710
I organizing your mind and also it gives
you a specific place to look for the

452
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,200
information that you've memorized

453
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,269
arm this is a huge this is hugely
advantageous

454
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:31,100
over the regular ways of going about
memorizing things the common methods

455
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,649
which are

456
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:35,760
reading it over and over a writing it
over and over

457
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,649
reciting it yourself continuously when
you do that you know oftentimes you'll

458
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,710
draw a blank in when you draw a blank
here

459
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,380
you kinda screwed by the snow nothing
you can do you just hope that it comes

460
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,429
back to you

461
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:50,649
here you have specific place to look for
information

462
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:56,330
see huge advantage also if at any point
you draw a blank say he drew a blank

463
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,408
you forgot at the white at the right
foot was watch

464
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:03,429
you simply get more of your senses
involved at that particular location so

465
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:04,440
I just described

466
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,399
mainly a visual or a and hearing the
watch is ticking louder and louder he

467
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,549
see the watch shatter

468
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,370
but maybe we'll watch shatters pieces in
the watch your hand

469
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,480
and then you those pieces cuz it's made
of candy

470
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,269
if you get those additional senses
involve then

471
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:23,980
it becomes very very easy to recall
information

472
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,139
okay um next thing I want to talk about

473
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:33,019
is remembering names okay how can you
better remember people's names

474
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:36,539
remembering names is incredibly
important in business

475
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:41,080
and in your personal life I often pull I
the famous book how to win friends and

476
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,279
influence people

477
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,169
in that book Dale Carnegie for Dale
Carnegie wrote that the sweetest sound a

478
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:47,799
person

479
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:52,360
and any language is the sound of their
own name and also that everyone's

480
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,580
favorite subject is themself

481
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,870
K cell if you were able to remember
people's names

482
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,970
and other information about them helps
you to build better

483
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,529
a business as well as personal
relationships with

484
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:10,600
so I first give you some practical steps
to take one meeting people aside from

485
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,789
these type a visual memory techniques I
step number one

486
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,799
whenever you're introduced to someone
make it a point to immediately

487
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,649
repeat the name in some way so if you're
introduced to someone named Jack

488
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:26,559
I you simply same things to me jack it's
great to meet you jack

489
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,519
um something like that will go a long
way towards helping you remember then

490
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,840
cuz its force you to put more focus on
the name

491
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,389
that will help prevent it from simply
going in one ear and out the other

492
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:40,710
next thing early on in your interaction
with the person

493
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,809
make it a point to ask them a question I

494
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,580
using their name so jack will brings you
the conference jack have you ever been

495
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,760
to the whole conference

496
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,639
up before Jack how do you know Chester
something like that a question

497
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:56,389
utilizing the name again ideas to put
more focus prevent it from going in one

498
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:57,309
ear out the other

499
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:02,408
third step um take just a few seconds to
think I've

500
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:05,440
any association between the person's
name and

501
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,610
anything at all that you already know I
am i say anything I

502
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,830
I do mean anything so Jack might make
you think I've jack in the box

503
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,970
Jack might make you think the game jak
skills

504
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,210
jacks that you there on the floor a
anything that

505
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,830
I you can associate with the name you
know someone else named Jack

506
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,689
your friend or family member named Jack
maybe a you think I've Jack from lost

507
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,990
anything like that any type Association
like that

508
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,350
will will help you to remember the name
last step

509
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,059
arm when you leave the meeting leave the
conference leave the party whatever

510
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,070
make it a point to say goodbye to the
person using the name by Jack I hope to

511
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,428
see you again sometime Jack

512
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,350
I anything like that you do that it will
go a long way towards helping you

513
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,610
remember the the persons name the next
time

514
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,940
you see them and also if at that point
you don't remember the name I recommend

515
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,750
that you go ahead ask the name again

516
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,830
they won't be offended in fact they most
people will appreciate the fact that

517
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,369
you're taking you're making the effort
to remember their name the next time you

518
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:05,110
see 'em

519
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,299
K now if you combine all those practical
steps with the visual

520
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,649
memory improvement technique that I'm
going to give you now it becomes almost

521
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:15,320
difficult to forget people's names

522
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,399
the visual technique is to

523
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,119
pick out a something unique about the
person okay

524
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:25,619
use your imagination to exaggerate that
thing whatever it may be it may be a

525
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,360
feat facial feature

526
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,119
then you come up with an imager series
of images that your mind you have the

527
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,230
name

528
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,869
and you take the imager series of images
and you

529
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:39,309
use your creativity imagination to link
it to that special

530
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:44,340
feature that outstanding feature I'll
give you an example that I gave one CNN

531
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,830
that they've seen the thing was pretty
humorous I if you need

532
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,409
someone named John and John you think he
has rather be years

533
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,230
you might imagine those years as being
gigantic ears flapping on the side of

534
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,940
his head

535
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,909
and since names John you might imagine
any each year there's a toilet bowl

536
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,369
flushing

537
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:04,610
as in going to the John Wright it wasn't
quite as high

538
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,000
so then when you see if the person again
you see the big ears neck

539
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,159
imagery will come back out at you the
toilet flushing your mind you

540
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,849
the name is John it sounds kind of silly

541
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,250
um but I promise you it's a very
powerful technique you all

542
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,159
really dramatically improve your ability
remember people's names

543
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,830
it's similar to the body US technique
where we stored

544
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,569
a information at locations on our body
but now we're storing it on the other

545
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,440
person's body

546
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,280
another example of you meet someone
named Jane you think she has rather

547
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,530
beautiful hair

548
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,720
you might imagine their hairs may have
chains

549
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,440
okay and the next time you see are you
notice a really beautiful hair again

550
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,530
imagery about being made a chains mean
the chains are clanking against each

551
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,220
other

552
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,470
chain for mind you I've Jane

553
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:55,240
that is another example I granted this
does take

554
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,830
a bit of practice but if you practice
you pick up become very good and

555
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,940
be able to learn a person's name I in 10
seconds or less I've done this

556
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,200
a I spoke at a conference for the
California Federation of interpreters

557
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,359
and a as people walked into my seminar I
should their hand met some

558
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,430
there's about 200 people in the audience
and I

559
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,868
was able to name everybody in the room
um

560
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:24,050
so that the technique is a very powerful
and effective

561
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,680
I'm going to go into the question and
answer session

562
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,690
now um but before I do that I would

563
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,680
like to take some volunteers from the
audience to help me pass out these

564
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,470
evaluation forms

565
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,510
I I want you to evaluate me i've really

566
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:45,510
appreciate your inputs on the
presentation

567
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,789
and I before we start the question and
answer session

568
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:57,089
um people often ask me

569
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,130
you know if I provide additional
training Thu I have a force that will

570
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,259
help improve your memory

571
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:05,219
I do some going to quickly talk about
that I have a home study force

572
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:09,019
they can help you improve your memory I
the course

573
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:12,059
is six hours worth of interactive
instruction

574
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,819
it's very similar to this presentation
fun and educational exercises

575
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:20,630
arm the first session is memory
fundamentals

576
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,229
I am during that session I teach you a
wide variety of memory improvement

577
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:28,269
techniques that can help improve your
memory in general

578
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,819
I teach a number memory session I

579
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:35,839
which teaches you how to remember any
type of information that contains

580
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,489
numbers

581
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:39,839
phone numbers passwords backs that
contain figures

582
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,069
um all sorts of information exchange
numbers

583
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:47,599
the third session is names and faces I
teach you a wide variety of techniques

584
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,229
that to help you a remember names and
faces better there are additional

585
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:52,130
techniques

586
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,170
additional variations on the ones that I
covered today

587
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,369
I that course actually stimulates
introducing you to forty plus people

588
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,439
you'll see a a slideshow on my website
and you'll see the person they're named

589
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,038
Jack

590
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,039
John Alice solve and so forth

591
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,749
see can really build up this memory
skill

592
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:16,539
the last session covers building up a
large vocabulary in a foreign language

593
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:19,819
quickly and easily using these types of
memory techniques

594
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:22,959
it covers giving speeches and
presentations from memory without

595
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,308
looking at any notes

596
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:29,199
and it teaches how to easily master
material for college course exams

597
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,359
and certification exams right

598
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,630
up quickly I want to give you some more
information about numbers

599
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,799
um how I did the number memory
demonstration is

600
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:43,489
I came up with an image or series and
images to remind the beach number

601
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:47,349
and I linked it to locations from my
environment instead locations from my

602
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,999
body

603
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,699
that's something I teaching a course I
teach you a system that

604
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:55,469
you can use to take any number sequence
and create an image

605
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:59,140
and then you use locations from the
environment say this table

606
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,009
then the the the bar

607
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:06,459
stereo box and then the the screen from

608
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:09,348
the chair and anything to those
locations in order to recall the image

609
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:10,559
is there you can come up with

610
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,809
the number sequence arm on the order
form you will see

611
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:20,219
up prices for my home study course
there's also one day workshop that i

612
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,829
teach in San Francisco

613
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:26,219
I that corresponds to the same sessions
a home study course but it's live

614
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:30,849
one day instruction for me workshops
held on Saturdays in San Francisco

615
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,170
um if anyone is interested in anything

616
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,170
that I offer today I'm going to give you
a special offer

617
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,179
for the home study course rather than a
regular price 175

618
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:46,449
crossed that I'll today you can order
from the hundred dollars

619
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:50,130
if you're interested in Central School
workshop cross out that price and I'll

620
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,209
let you register for only two hundred
dollars

621
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:57,038
arm and for the workshop your
registration will count towards

622
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,609
any future workshop day that I have I'm
so if you register today are being

623
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,380
on a list that I maintaining your be
updated as states are added

624
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,449
and you can come to any future workshop
day at this point a question

625
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:14,589
questions and on anything that i've
talked about hi could you will just take

626
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:18,689
maybe three steps to write do those
numbers again backwards to be really

627
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,578
impressive but

628
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,839
okay you want me to go through the
number sequence we had to stop trying to

629
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,569
determine yeah I mean anybody can
members

630
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:29,619
well I probably couldn't a lot of people
to memorize things very short term

631
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:33,359
okay another kinda figured out the stick
those in short term it is. you next week

632
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,359
for those numbers are

633
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,369
on so with water view I it

634
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:41,309
its unique to the individual how long it
will last but using these techniques

635
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:43,670
that will stick a lot longer than the
traditional

636
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,089
methods memorizing things if I were to
have memorize this just pyro

637
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:50,558
how people use the writing i5 forgot
about that but I should still be able to

638
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,199
repeat it forwards and backwards at this
point um

639
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,239
and all go and do that but I finish the
answer because we're making very

640
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,150
efficient use of our brains with these
techniques okay

641
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,959
um that is the key I've spent the last
10 years of my life

642
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:07,868
%uh studying the most powerful and
effective techniques for memorizing very

643
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:09,719
specific types of information

644
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,849
so that I could perform at extraordinary
levels and when the USA national memory

645
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:14,839
championship

646
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:18,499
actually represented the United States
in the world memory championship

647
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:23,400
so you can be you can rest assured that
the techniques that I'm teaching you

648
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,289
are the best techniques out there. so we
repeat it really quick

649
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:30,329
it was 95 8 um

650
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:34,049
61 one 720 83

651
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:37,779
8 arm 3

652
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:41,349
Oklahoma a to

653
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:44,909
5 3 08 for

654
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:51,909
arm and then it was a %uh

655
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:56,809
well I know the last 3809

656
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:03,809
on

657
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:19,060
although and

658
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,200
he got a hand hit you so choose message
up

659
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,620
I of I got it

660
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,330
its 557 site 557 809

661
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:38,020
great backwards night backwards I feel
bad i mess it up so let me go back over

662
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,750
its so backwards it should be nine 0

663
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,120
8 7 55 right

664
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,600
and then um for

665
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,790
8 0 I am

666
00:41:53,790 --> 00:42:00,180
352

667
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,549
83 8 027

668
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:09,380
one 16 859

669
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,940
terrific maybe thank you guess

670
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,520
%uh so all these techniques that you've
shown a really cool

671
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,700
if you have in mind already that you
have something she wanna commit to

672
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,130
memory

673
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,000
to him however if you find yourself in
the position of trying to recall

674
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,420
something that you didn't

675
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,250
previously used to so she was something
a

676
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,860
using one of these techniques deserve
method for delving

677
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,990
back in some memory that should be there
but is harder to access

678
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,770
on you know I specialize in teaching you
the proper way to encode information in

679
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,670
the first place

680
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,890
so that it's easier to read if you
didn't include it properly in the first

681
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:50,299
place

682
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,240
so you learn to just by rote
memorization techniques it's going to be

683
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,930
harder

684
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,960
I mean I can get I'm not an expert in
what you've described I'm an expert in

685
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,550
code encoding a properly

686
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,760
I can give me some recommendations which
is I try to

687
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,660
you become very relaxed alright and I
try to think about everything I can

688
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,649
around that piece of information

689
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,830
I often if you can think of as much as
possible surrounding that a banner that

690
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,870
piece of information

691
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,509
it'll trigger that particular memory
that you're looking for SATs

692
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,880
recommendation I could give you

693
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
again I'm really an expert Inc encoding
it properly in the first place

694
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,720
okay thanks yep from so I guess my
question be what was your initial

695
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,630
motivation for going into

696
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,640
memory work which I wouldn't think a
contest would be in your first initial

697
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,129
in of I'll so I I became interested in
memory techniques I saw

698
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,160
a segment on the USA national memory
championship on ABC's 20/20

699
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,390
it just seemed really interesting to me
I am you know but I when I looked into

700
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,980
what the top scorers in the country or
scoring

701
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,750
I realize that there's no way I would
feel they do the things they were doing

702
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,620
so that's when I started studying a wide
variety of memory improvement techniques

703
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,940
I started practicing

704
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,210
and I came up with what worked best for
me for each particular

705
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,510
event and then I iced train with those
and

706
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,310
and i ended up doing doing pretty pretty
well

707
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:21,360
so Nazi TV didn't actually tell your
mind this one

708
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,270
yes it is on aside a question haha I as

709
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,940
a you know a group move technologically
inclined people are used to working with

710
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,140
an amount love storage space and
computers for example that is

711
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,920
finite is there any idea about how much
information the brain can holes

712
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,760
um its supposedly limitless

713
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,800
in the mountains information that we can
store it's really

714
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,050
you know a matter if you forget if you
organize things properly in your mind

715
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:51,410
right

716
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,950
and you store these things away in
specific locations in your mind

717
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,760
you can recall crazy amounts of things I
mean in the world memory championship

718
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,140
I perm perfectly memorized a 1000 digit
sequence in only one hour

719
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,259
I memorize ten separate decks of playing
cards in an hour

720
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,860
on may first time this year I did a
memory demonstration

721
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,680
I was on NBC news at one point where you
know people

722
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,040
call though any random year between 1875

723
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,480
and 2009 and immediately told them the
name love the winning

724
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,100
force the winning jockey in the time
that took the win the race down to a

725
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,210
hundredth of a second for the Kentucky
Derby

726
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:30,850
arm so I mean this is this is this just
another example the types of things you

727
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,660
can do

728
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,470
when you've mastered these techniques in
your your filing things away properly in

729
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,960
your mind that cool thank you okay
thanks for the talk

730
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,540
on to know if it's possible develop a
photographic memory

731
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,860
so I've read extensively on the
supposedly there's no such thing as a

732
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,270
photographic memory

733
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,500
at least not in the way that we think of
this as we has its perks trade in the

734
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,460
movies

735
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,390
arm they've done many studies to prove
that there is a photographic memory they

736
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,509
will take people

737
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:03,150
they'll have them come in people that
have extraordinary memory ability right

738
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,830
safer numbers for instance I and they
will have no

739
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:11,029
does show that person a great have
numbers and they will say go ahead and

740
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:12,330
memorize this recall

741
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:16,670
the grain from top to bottom left to
right in the report that time right

742
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,960
then they say the person okay now we
call that number sequence diagonally

743
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,290
alright and therefore the time in it
significantly longer

744
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,620
so if this were actually a photographic
image

745
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,640
that they're looking at their mind the
recall time should be approximately the

746
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,629
same

747
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,660
so what that proves is the person is

748
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,089
actually and they have it running them
either actually reporting in their mind

749
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,080
in some way that's meaningful to them

750
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,049
but it's not photographic image another
study they've taken people's

751
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:51,880
extraordinary memory ability and they
will splatter some dots onto a page

752
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,710
there's no meaning at all to a rape um

753
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,910
and they will still take feet away and
say okay perfectly rip reproduce the

754
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,529
splattering

755
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,290
dots no one's ever been able to do that
so it's not

756
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,500
a photographic images at that they're
looking at another thing chess players

757
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,880
have amazing memory for the places on
the board right when they give chess

758
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,500
players

759
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,800
aboard that has some sort of meaning in
chess

760
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,890
and the act they take away and ask them
the reproduce that they can do it when

761
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,520
they give them another board has no
meaning

762
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,870
they would have no meaning no sense in a
chess game they can't put the pieces

763
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,799
back in a

764
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,750
right place thank you yep

765
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,900
arm I was wondering about

766
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,030
om how this process scales

767
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,370
when you're dealing with different kinds
of information

768
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,980
or even just different scales and
information for example

769
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,460
would you use the same techniques if you
were going to study physics for four

770
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,470
years and wanted to remember all

771
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:56,470
arm yes so I teach in in the home study
course in my workshop on the thing i cum

772
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,480
where things like cover is college
course material

773
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,620
arm and I cover some complex type
concepts one thing I teach specifically

774
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,120
and the course is how to memorize that
convection is the transfer of heat

775
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,930
from an area of higher temperature to an
area of lower temperature

776
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,560
its always basically coming up with an
imager series of images that remind you

777
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,970
of what you want remember

778
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,590
in this case I I will always remember
that back as I see in my mind an image

779
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,760
of the Convention

780
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,330
the convention reminds me of convection
right so I see convention

781
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,620
its it consists of two levels right
there's people appear on the

782
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,100
higher-level

783
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,180
people appear on the lower area to area
is right an itch

784
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,919
each area I see it tomorrow thermometer
to remind me of temperature I

785
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,880
and then a fire breaks out at the top
level people are screaming the fire

786
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,760
breaks out that reminds me of heat

787
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,910
and the fire transfers from the higher
area and its to the people at the bottom

788
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,250
start getting burned

789
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:54,060
running around %uh so that image it's a
crazy funny image I have it stored away

790
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,190
in a journey

791
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,010
which is another technique that I teach
in the course um so I see that their

792
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:00,230
minds me that

793
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:04,150
convection is a the transfer fee from an
area of higher temperature than a review

794
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,530
for temperature

795
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:09,950
so even complicated complex concepts can
be memorized using these

796
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,340
types of techniques hopefully that

797
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,450
hands I'm

798
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,430
I wanted to ask when you if and when you
find yourself making a mistake say

799
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,460
blank on series of numbers or your

800
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,960
you're straining to catch your

801
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,190
catch the connection to the next what is
it that goes to your head

802
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:37,020
or what is it that you do to mitigate
that problem in the future

803
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,370
or what is the binding point where you
yeah

804
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:43,750
so again you know really just tryna
thank you

805
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,100
relax urself I goes a long way

806
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,800
and it's about the initial encoding so
if you're reviewing: in your spine that

807
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,200
you

808
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,620
forgetting it again really again
additional senses involve

809
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,390
if you do that it becomes very easy to
remember

810
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,960
was just wondering if there's an
difference bottling which to use to

811
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,260
remember stuff from my mom things on
English but it was perfectly able to

812
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,020
record

813
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,710
for instance least any difference in
using them open

814
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:18,280
on as long as you can picture whatever
it is you know if you can free and image

815
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,410
in your mind and see the image then
these techniques work Fri

816
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:26,410
but still the English repeat it. so I'm
not asking you to see the words right

817
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:30,100
I'm asking you to see an image so if
you're you know

818
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,550
what somebody said to you monkey and
whatever language

819
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,760
as long as you're seeing the image

820
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,300
I yet okay so we're

821
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,730
you did have a little trouble at the end
you remember XO

822
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,280
could you possibly take us through your
slater

823
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,940
journey to remember that particular
sequence because you were choking in

824
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,220
three digit pieces yeah so this is your
got some kind of technique

825
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,730
to get 3d yes so I'll go through very
very quickly

826
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,580
um lot it's not gonna make sense to you
at this point you don't know how the

827
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,080
system

828
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,390
XIII teacher system that allows you to
it

829
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,379
take any number sequencing create an
image from that sequence

830
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,260
and up because I compete in the world
memory championship I have an image in

831
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,260
my mind associated with every

832
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,800
possible three digit sequence sells for
every so there's a thousand in the go to

833
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,940
my mind

834
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,780
so whenever I see a three digit sequence
automatically this image comes to my

835
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,390
mind

836
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,990
so 95 days this purse I know from high
school name Belva

837
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:33,370
661 is this girl who in my mind is very
jaded

838
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:37,740
that's what 66 are 6-1 once I 611

839
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,970
611 as jaded um and then 720 this guy I
know

840
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,330
for my tennis club named carnes and then

841
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:50,590
838 is earmuffs but it's you know
whenever I see those sequences

842
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:54,510
arm those images come to my mind so
comes with training

843
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,550
it's very easy for anyone to do but it's
gonna take a little training most people

844
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,450
want your start out with a 0-0 through
99

845
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,960
you'll come up with a hundred images and
that's the first thing they teach you in

846
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,310
in the home state courts

847
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:14,370
it's a lilac I

848
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:18,400
I was wondering in case you tried any
supplements or drugs to boost memory

849
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,580
such as

850
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,549
Arbaaz a press in our seato calling
boosters and your thoughts on those

851
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:29,180
how okay so you know we are very very
serious in his memory competitions

852
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,520
so um you know I do try to

853
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,570
a take things that are that have been
shown to improve your memory

854
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,680
I mean I I'll tell you what I take for
six starting six weeks prior condition

855
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,140
well every day take a multivitamin
because you know the ideas healthy body

856
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,299
healthy mind

857
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,210
but closer accomplish I'll take a bit
start taking B vitamin complex to

858
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,720
improve concentration

859
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,100
also take up fish oil because

860
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,350
your brain is composed of omega-3 fatty
acids very important a proper brain

861
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,400
function

862
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,880
I don't eat too much fish or seafood so
I really need take that

863
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,580
also taking gold global which is been
shown to increase the circuit the

864
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,480
full blood to the brain muscles are some
things that I take

865
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,320
I do know some people take choline

866
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,190
tablets which colin is a precursor to
seal choline

867
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,790
which is important to memory and
learning in the brain I don't personally

868
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,680
take that back

869
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,130
okay that's my answer awesome talk

870
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,310
enjoy this thanks I can barely remember
my own phone number because

871
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:36,250
off-loaded almost everything onto a PDA
like a text file

872
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,150
whatever so I'm curious 1 like what your
thought about technology and justly

873
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,940
leasing muscles atrophy are to

874
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,410
I could see me learning indexed media

875
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:54,040
actually find the data but I think right
now we to achieve that remembered

876
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,900
yes so you brought up a good point I
often talk about the point is you know

877
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,120
we all use to have the ability to
remember so many

878
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,890
phone numbers so far friends and family
members right

879
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,900
but now with the cell phone which if you
were asked to remember one number you

880
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,580
start freaking out on I gotta write down
I

881
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:17,140
oh man that's because you're so used to
enter in things in a phone

882
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,680
but this pools I have one minute left

883
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,960
this proves the use it or lose it
principle I if you use your memory

884
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,420
it will get better if you don't use it
will decay

885
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,250
one last thing about the class home
study course workshop

886
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,660
actually forget that just give me the
form either way

887
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,509
a bring it up here said it on the table
or if you don't have a chance to do that

888
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,570
I will be in the back

889
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,680
give me the forms I what even if you
don't want to order anything

890
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,930
arm I want at least evaluation above the
top

891
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,950
yet I just want to point out that marine
phytoplankton

892
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,190
is another thing you can take to to
improve your mind by

893
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,140
let's first what was it marine
phytoplankton it comes in a little while

894
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,230
0 simple to take and it's better than
anything else so you're done

895
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,560
rate unless all its full ATP which is
self

896
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,000
and in it kicks off growth inhibitors
and her

897
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,060
sorry growth factors you bring what's
really good stuff

898
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:15,890
thank you

899
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,859
at a question about people who have
certain

900
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,760
senses that be don't work has been
purses blind because visualization is so

901
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,690
important

902
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,880
your study to review for it to work with
people who have some middle

903
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,850
hearing disabilities speeches believe
visualization disability

904
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:38,069
and how it affects the memory with these
techniques yes so you know with the wind

905
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,120
it depends

906
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:46,100
okay but you know again if they can
picture it

907
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:53,100
okay yet

908
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,550
smartphone ownage is up next in this
room
