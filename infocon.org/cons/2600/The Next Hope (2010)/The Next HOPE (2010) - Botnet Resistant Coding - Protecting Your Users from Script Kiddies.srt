vendor tables we have hammocks so after
the talk going down to

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,580
why mezzanine check it out lotsa stuff
what's a good stuff happened there

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,650
other fam wants mention on track for

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,990
is going to be starting in the Morris
room track for

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,880
is open so they're actually sign up
sheets posted outside the courtroom so

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,399
if you guys want to give your own talk

your own talk over and

12
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,000
in the Marshall with that said if

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,410
on Zeus botnet scissors Trojans their

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,300
readily available they are pretty easy
to use for the

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,340
technologically on Saturday we have
Peter greco

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,960
and Harbin rothschild here to talk to us
about how to work code to

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,960
resist barnett's MP

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,159
unfav we're here to talk show you

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,250
on techniques to mitigate against
barnett's

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,650
particularly focusing on postal orders
am

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,110
we'd like to put a disclaimer that on
were not intended to teach people how to

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,840
use

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,930
botnets and post loggers in in
particular and that on

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,259
criminals web servers were harmed during
our research

25
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:30,729
we're gonna talk about the

26
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:34,400
brief explanation of what botnets are
particularly the Zeus Trojan

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,130
we also looked at spy I to but for this
talk

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,140
we're going to focus on six because it
seems to be the most perfect

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,079
one home we're gonna talk about the
psychology behind about master

30
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,079
a little bit about each small basics and
we're gonna show

31
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,820
methods have medication that we came up
so

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,970
on little things arm it for

33
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,158
are for personal computers out there are
infected with

34
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,030
now we're mostly including this one

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,560
on Zeus

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
collects logins passwords cookies view
state parameters

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,190
virtually everything past in a post
requests

38
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,530
hence the name host loggers from the
infected machines communicate with

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,970
communicate role server

40
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,170
which is a our PHP web application

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,610
through your server issue P-forty post
requests

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,540
that on take the post 80 I'm compiles
its into a text file

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,810
zips it off rc4 encryption sends it over
to the

44
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,940
web server arm malicious deals with the
web browser

45
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,709
and reports are entered into an SQL
database on the actual server

46
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,019
or text files depending on how you set
it up on the command control centers

47
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,150
definitely a user-friendly PHP
application so

48
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,209
don't need a lot of skill to know how to
use it

49
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,220
Zeus

50
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,730
works the propagation methods is usually
by spam and phishing

51
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,109
are infected cryptid p2p where's exploit
packs

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,599
are the largest one of theirs Eleanor
arm

53
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,830
usually followed by Frank is for unique
their iframe droppers PDF

54
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,620
and the sometimes include flash

55
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,680
exploits to of social engineering some
me and larger part of its

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,890
getting people to download Fig codex is
software

57
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,920
and the other things others fear the
actions louise's works

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,430
infects fax machine arm in Jax

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,440
threaded to services sexy and

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,590
it's pretty much invisible the tax
measure the windows anywhere you can use

61
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,930
across six foursomes

62
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,580
thread by for the most part visible arm

63
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,260
the configuration files are Windows
folder

64
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,370
in the system32 folder arm it hides the
folder using key

65
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,150
technology and for the most part

66
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,730
hard to detect has a very low detection
made by any fires

67
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,450
because how how many

68
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,090
different variants there are people
returns for people encrypt

69
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,280
lot methods of obfuscation where it's
really hard for

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,739
TV vendors to actually all good

71
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,130
basically the life cycles use for SANZAR

72
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,570
with 30 a builder it's inexcusable file
if to run on Windows machine

73
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,290
which is kind of ironic on done zips
into a an actual

74
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,759
up paleo generator and %uh the php files
that you need for your webserver

75
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,150
from there the generator payload usually

76
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,820
gets sent choose the machine through
various web expose her tits of hers as

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,610
we talk to use

78
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,620
earlier infection sheen post logs

79
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,080
since the back post transmission to back
to the server which then gets put in the

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,919
database and financial data

81
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:53,969
is then harvested out if this

82
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,949
large collection posts are here's an
example

83
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,380
blogs use control panel and usually
tells you what version it is this is

84
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,199
kind of an old version

85
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,570
endured organizes the your infections by
country shows you how many online

86
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,300
are offline and the major thing that
we're gonna be focusing on

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,289
is the report section this is where one
of the means that

88
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:19,509
bot masters harvest the credentials that
they need

89
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,580
to get money the primary tool used as
searching database

90
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,960
57 files are searching files another
interesting thing

91
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,388
is a Jabber notifier as we know arm
Jeter is a

92
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,690
an open-source into messaging system
that the

93
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,979
on Zeus will actually notify the bomb
ass ur

94
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:42,349
waiting to see that comes around
searchers of a bank login session

95
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,370
or any of the other there's many plugins
that you can get that work with the

96
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,270
journal too far to send you

97
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,180
that information types use work on this
is a sample reports file

98
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,020
as we can see you have the body PR
operating system

99
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,389
know what country it's from and the
website that it

100
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,440
visited for this as we can see arm

101
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,630
this website sample reports felt this is
the actual post log data that we could

102
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,240
see

103
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,590
as as you see every single post
parameter get spoiled

104
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,930
into a tax for a text file or injured in
the database

105
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,240
here we have email my first name last
name credit card information basically

106
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,000
everything that I can flip

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,289
for about twenty dollars on subprime
market

108
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:33,030
psychology apart mister

109
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,210
on basically most part masters

110
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,180
as we look at it we're actually slowing
technical skill they're very impatient

111
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,970
with harvesting have credentials

112
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,800
and a lot of times they were lying
others to set up their botnet so

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,780
there are actually people that do that
sell services feel

114
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,840
of Matt fun at home installations which
is usually included

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,460
30 an exploit kit which the log on to
whatever server they have

116
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,090
the install the botnet install the
exploit kit the set up the campaign for

117
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,620
them

118
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,310
and then the BOM issued a six pack and
uses the means of

119
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,240
getting the campaign out there and
collecting the information

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,580
arm this is the basic flow chart where
the bot master sits

121
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,469
on the on the actual crime flow we see
we have the bot master and one and

122
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,289
he works with the character the
character actually help support master

123
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,530
cell data sometimes the character is the
bomb Master but

124
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,020
a lot of times Eagles over on another
thing our trust is very important

125
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,409
in cybercrime market from there day
tickets sold to

126
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,130
carter's mixed orders pornographer
spammers

127
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,250
and the service is going we might use
you okay

128
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,370
what does a character look like this is
a typical character that's being

129
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,669
advertised on forums that is selling

130
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,440
botnet data okay when who buys partner
data

131
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
well this site was created

132
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,810
this is actually purses home do choose
the

133
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,629
economic collapse a lot of pornographers
cannot afford models

134
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:08,650
so now they're going to hack data as a
cheaper fare

135
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,080
of collecting the information and as we
know the Internet is worldwide

136
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,250
we found horses accounts on

137
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,389
all language sirs

138
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,740
so HTP basics arm

139
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,349
there's two kinds of East request that
we're concerned was really

140
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,940
we're gonna have fun sp get requests on

141
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,229
normally I guess most you know what this
is fun its

142
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,690
browser us for our some data from the
server deters

143
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,709
server responds data arm you have a lot
more these

144
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:46,480
than pulls requests on an users na
landed in there

145
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
arm you know when developers don't like
putting

146
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,830
on lessons in the league record numbers
things like that

147
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,290
the get requests because that'll show as
far

148
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,920
if if you showing you know credit card
numbers yeah just for you got your palms

149
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,240
is

150
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,680
arm sp post requests

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,149
arm pretty much would

152
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:14,839
zoos is designed to to do is just log
these pools requests

153
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,370
souls what usually goes through here is
anytime you submit a form

154
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,120
goes through the post credit card
numbers

155
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,510
user names passwords or anything like
that

156
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,470
we sold the important thing is that zoos
does not

157
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,660
only locks post requests and does not
long get requests

158
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,230
soldiers a lot of information that we
can pass from

159
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,490
the server to the client get request for
the various methods that were

160
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,450
going to show you from here we hey we
came up with four basic methods of

161
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,450
communication now

162
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,070
these are a hundred percent foolproof
and we weren't looking

163
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,480
to you come up with black and white ways

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,500
blocking if the person's good they're
gonna get the data that's guaranteed

165
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,500
and we're focusing on what can we do
from a server-side web application

166
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,120
development process

167
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,450
when we know that the client machine is
compromised

168
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,779
to save them from losing all their data

169
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,149
so we came up with the basic method
which is all methods that can be changed

170
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,149
in the following sections of 2 pages
think it serves to the client

171
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:23,730
on which you are medium at its
introduces JavaScript methods have

172
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,279
posted obfuscation

173
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,790
hard methods we had elements have
javascript and server side session ng

174
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,560
which includes AJAX requests and then of
course nightmare

175
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,880
we shoul symmetric encryption method

176
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,070
in this we're gonna show that there's
now it's important as

177
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,779
web master that you need to focus on
server load

178
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,820
so throughout this presentation reassure
you different

179
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,019
and the examples that we've created um

180
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,570
icons that show how heavy the server
loaders

181
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,700
saw basic investigative basic methods

182
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,730
mitigation includes obfuscation a very
big names

183
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,180
an extraneous hidden post parameters

184
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,440
as we can see you don't need to name
your variable CC number

185
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
okay the look through this four things

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,550
CC number everything the UC

187
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,910
as you saw your port section they
searched through it you could name this

188
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,829
variable

189
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:24,810
anything you want and as long as the
server-side and client-side knowles

190
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,860
it's great you can all as you can see
here

191
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,279
this is a prominent website that name to
their password password

192
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,689
and their confirmation confirmation
which

193
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,089
as the bomb ass to go through the post
requests can easily find us

194
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:47,200
of course we all know hidden fields you
can also use this to put in

195
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,709
falsely data as I have listed here

196
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:55,820
and to the client Regency that I put
into extraneous hidden post primers

197
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,950
just junk data and from the client that
uses it

198
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,339
they see their main field being the
account number but

199
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,279
in the actual post request we see a
whole bunch of other junk data

200
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,350
that blokes Laux but master cell

201
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,079
Laux they sell their massive chunk data
as a per

202
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,060
megabyte bases and trust is very
important so

203
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,779
quality of those logs includes more
money that they can make

204
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,180
after quality isn't that good they're
going to make less money

205
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,920
and its gonna really hurt the
marketplace

206
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,110
basics have medication basics

207
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,029
methods of communication medium includes
all basic methods

208
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,360
and the actual obfuscation

209
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,320
of the data through pre-fixed in Postfix
thing

210
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,519
parameter modification and rejects
replacement using javascript

211
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,010
as we know post looks post loggers to
not

212
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,610
log get requests so we can send our
JavaScript functions to the client

213
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,760
computer and they will not be reported

214
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,760
in the zoo stator from there and we use
on

215
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,670
are hidden parameter creation from the
on Submit button

216
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,970
which shot then the javascript function
takes the form input value in blanks the

217
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,060
original one

218
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,139
loaded on the page and sends it back to
client

219
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:18,740
which then on the server side code gmail
user here's a simple

220
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,000
jobs for function for prefixing post
fixing you can do

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,990
any number 12 string manipulation that
you want as long as you can

222
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,660
undo it on the server side which
whatever server-side code using

223
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,089
on here's already X example replacing
the five into with the number

224
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,399
percent from here you can use arm

225
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,589
this is the most important thing here
would you take the very issue take the

226
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,360
field

227
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,220
loaded create a hidden variable do the
data Mangler

228
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,579
putting into the form in this all
happens onsubmit

229
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,860
and then it takes the original input
value and makes it

230
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,490
any arbitrary number so when the bomb
Master goes to look at those logs

231
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,860
they're gonna see the CC number thinking
they're getting a valid one

232
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,350
and other getting his job data when the
original one is now

233
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,399
mangled by the JavaScript and then
teaming

234
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,480
on the clan on the server side

235
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,269
methods of communication hard this we
actually introduce basic c4 concurred

236
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,899
encoding and concatenation and
tokenization

237
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,329
up to values this is our a little more
def called

238
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,720
too little harder in the server
server-side thing and we use

239
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,110
Ajax are posting messages to fill the
data with

240
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,699
fill the locks with Victor

241
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:36,440
this is the basics of 64 encoding and
decoding if anybody doesn't know

242
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,519
auspey 64's we're sending our picture
data

243
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,589
over eight extra-base media and can be
very useful

244
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:46,870
in obfuscation techniques okay web
server session

245
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,050
this is very important because we can
store home

246
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,180
to we can have several different
JavaScript data mingling sessions

247
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm functions that we can use with the
session

248
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,070
so as we create a session with the
client computer in the web server

249
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,709
we can assign a day to make links a data
mingling function

250
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,790
that goes to the client is unique to
that session

251
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,699
soul when the bot master then goes back
old a day later a week later a month

252
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:15,339
later

253
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,769
and then try to go to the site to get
the actual jobs for mingling function

254
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,279
it's going to be completely different
and make your really hard for them to

255
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,279
determine

256
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,910
what is validator in one isn't

257
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,149
so this is how we do missus mitigation
heart this is actually a little more

258
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,310
worry actually have eighty input fields

259
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,350
without foreign tax okay then we use

260
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,720
regular each email button with unscrewed
on click javascript function

261
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,690
from the onclick javascript: function it
creates a hidden form

262
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,699
through JavaScript cat meets all the
input tax

263
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,230
into one long string with the delimiter
then use a hidden form field to put the

264
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,649
concatenated value

265
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:00,940
base64 encoded you can also do a rejects
replacement of certain characters so the

266
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,630
candy b64

267
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,149
and then it sends their former as a post
back to the server

268
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,610
as you can see here here's an example of
that of the concatenation function

269
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,180
with the helmet creating the former and
then sending it to the server

270
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,759
on on this from the onsubmit

271
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,250
here's another way you can use Ajax to
send intermittent post requests

272
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,579
to fill the logs ok useless junk data

273
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,589
and then have a server recognize wanna
real

274
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,740
on post comes through basically the fall
everything is loaded from the GET

275
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,459
request

276
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:41,240
to the client-side with the HX function
the Ajax function starts up as user goes

277
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,290
through the page

278
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,470
looks at it picks out what they want and
it's ending arbitrary useless data

279
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,610
posted back to the server

280
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,529
this will fill up the botnet logs and
cause a lot of data that they would have

281
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,860
to sift through to figure out what's
going on

282
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,170
from the onsubmit there's a parameter
number said

283
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,820
by the the web server that will tell
that this is the real POST request to

284
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,120
pay attention to

285
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,949
that would be sent in the server will
then get the data and be able to

286
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,169
and to these functions okay as we see
here this is a a basic Ajax

287
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,620
script you can use

288
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,240
from here we have perfect poster
function that sends the uses random

289
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,439
number function

290
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,939
to send phone name you know you can send
credit card data

291
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,900
and then of course you use the same
function or pretty similar function

292
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,320
with that unique number in it that would
tell the server that

293
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,668
this is the valid post to pay attention
to okay

294
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:39,730
methods have medication nightmare

295
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,880
this we actually picked up rc4
encryption with rotating keys

296
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,900
as we know rc4 encryption is not a very
good encryption algorithm

297
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,690
preferably used by web but the method
that it does

298
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,850
uses the same key for all transaction
but

299
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,379
if we rotate the key through a session
variable

300
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,809
and send in change it every time they're
supposed to communicate back and forth

301
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:05,980
we can then have a different key for
every session

302
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,080
that to fear is in the submit which will

303
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,980
cause to sent back encrypt the data

304
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,090
the UH uniform is pages loaded the
JavaScript

305
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,409
with symmetrical rc4 cue sent to the
client

306
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,600
now that sent in the GET request which
is not recorded

307
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,230
in Zeus postmarks from there the
consummate your

308
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,330
Darcy for cryptic post is sent to the
web server

309
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,360
the stolen data is totally useless

310
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,660
4 the typical Bob master

311
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,390
and as you can see the rc4 encryption
for javascript function is

312
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,190
only 10 lines so as a client-side

313
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,480
looking at the JavaScript it's a very
minimal load

314
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,900
and wait for their applications

315
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,929
so on these are just examples to prevent

316
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,360
identity theft we know they are not 100
percent and we're looking at going to a

317
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,630
generalized

318
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,740
medication a whole and we know that
there will be

319
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,760
people out there that can bypass all of
this

320
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,440
there are many modules that people make
force you specify

321
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,410
specific to banks and are also through
the web injects function apps use

322
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,450
akin pretty much bypass this

323
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,110
and %uh Fabian is going to demonstrate
all over demos that we have the actual

324
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,460
code sections

325
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,600
alright so I haven't talked very much
we're lucky we're jockey

326
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,600
speaker

327
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:57,540
little fix say hello my friend he scares
world's writer

328
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,369
its here's the damn arm normally

329
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:20,509
actually this said

330
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:26,190
next yes connection

331
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:33,190
source of saint nothing

332
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,340
picture the rear brakes today this

333
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,320
okay

334
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,919
so normally have the HCPs

335
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,830
only and way this works is type in your
username

336
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,240
your password and hit the

337
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,320
the login button animes what's UC's

338
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,360
is

339
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,799
user name here as you can see I'm
dumping the the array see the user name

340
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,549
and the password right there but let's
look at the

341
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:34,960
simple site here arm

342
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,470
just basic thing here step in your
account number and then when we

343
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,280
do summit that again they're gonna get

344
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,480
some extra post renders here with much
junk data

345
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,630
the real stuff

346
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,910
and a lot more junk data

347
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,110
us school thank you

348
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,140
medium just

349
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,419
in your you know you credit card number

350
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,030
your account number

351
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,860
and with this one does is when you hit
submit its gambling out

352
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,140
the top form here with just

353
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,809
which opposes and what we're gonna get

354
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,410
is the CC numbers going to be John Deere

355
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,490
the other text box within

356
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,540
put anything on there and the real one
is gonna be

357
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,320
in here hard

358
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,510
so

359
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,980
what we're doing here is in the
background is actually doing

360
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,540
post requests arm see take

361
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:53,540
parents here news

362
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,960
capers conference over here arm

363
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,700
she name the address credit card number
expiration date CVV

364
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,910
and when you submit this arm

365
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,640
we'll get some it is this long

366
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,760
b64 you can see here's only a single
parameter

367
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,820
has concatenating all the yom can eating
all the parameters into one

368
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:29,149
long Bay 64 string and then

369
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:34,400
we can do demand on the server and we
have on the

370
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,160
information now you can also use the Reg
X replacement function

371
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,790
when you pay 64 to office key to be 64
function and make it harder for them

372
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,030
to decode

373
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,350
now for night so

374
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,540
this one is also doing the same thing
except the sending

375
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,129
are random data in cryptid with a random
key

376
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,670
every few seconds RM soul

377
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,070
if you're looking at the logs you're
gonna see

378
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,790
a buncha logs all this thx omitted hands

379
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,860
you can you could do you know which one
is a real one

380
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,030
and it all looks pretty much the same

381
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,940
so we put in our name phone numbers
number hostages rent

382
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,390
ransom demands and once we submit that
request

383
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,730
his with the post looks like the post
parameter

384
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,230
name is actually part of the office
cation arm

385
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:41,650
everything was random posts has a
different md5 hash

386
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,770
to some random number think it's
generated client-side

387
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,780
and 108 in here that's just

388
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,760
again reindeer doesn't mean anything

389
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,060
to anybody server rejects it but suspect

390
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,950
on the SE four key again is an md5
hashes number

391
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,580
but this one is the the actual real arm
key

392
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,669
and here's the secret to data arm

393
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,940
on server-side which hopefully did not
get picked up by the box

394
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,060
that's it for now

395
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,270
questions in the recalled one thing to
mention arm

396
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,710
with %uh flex of flex 4 has

397
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,700
actually has our MF encoding built into
it that makes it

398
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,120
really hard to decoded it can be done

399
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,260
it can be done with known programs out
there but most part masses will skip

400
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,180
over it because

401
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,770
they won't know what it is solar are new
technologies

402
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,680
with encoding encryption being built for
web applications

403
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,700
we're also looking to make a are dotnet
plug in module

404
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,750
that will do all this for the developers
slim

405
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,500
really you to do that is future
researched looking for right now these

406
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,880
examples are in PHP

407
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,750
are too busy many questions about
botnets

408
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:06,100
and or resistant coating arm

409
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,850
C sharp most people don't bother
encoding

410
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,600
there the state information with areas
pick servers 19

411
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,370
disease on Azadi could have used
information presented a whole bunch

412
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:23,000
Dennis home yep that's a very good
question artists use

413
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,210
just captures it does not decoded

414
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,280
points almost a few states as we know is
simple basic security code

415
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,420
and they do looking at view state and
they do use ViewState decoders to get

416
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,050
data on

417
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:41,399
that is on a major thing that I have
agence

418
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,860
seizure you know I do like seizure dude

419
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,360
secure but there are settings that you
can do for C sharp to

420
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,380
& Co encode right and encrypts the
ViewState

421
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,580
right yes ok think so that if we have
any seizure

422
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,629
developers here please encrypt review
states please

423
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,810
technologies any other questions

424
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,050
I guess is questionable Trojans to

425
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,860
yes

426
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,250
all just passing a GET request

427
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,930
soul specifically against Zeus for the
most part it's not going to begin on

428
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,260
I'm sure that there's ways of

429
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,450
configuring it to me to pick it up by
Nam

430
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,550
for the most part I mean right now
there's nothing

431
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,760
that's that in general but Pitt there
are

432
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,010
programmers out there that make plugins
forces use

433
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,370
that are specific to certain banking web
sites

434
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,510
soul they will create a module that will
grab those

435
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,180
get request arm encryption keys and will
store them

436
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,030
I V really ran into this but I have seen
a lot of plugins for Zeus

437
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,450
that do a lot of stuff but more so the
plugins for Zeus

438
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,420
just focus on the web in Jax portion of
it

439
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,460
Zeus is ignoring get requests because
they think it has no valuable data in

440
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,340
the channel

441
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,500
that's correct for injure I C and

442
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,310
and they're not parsing credit card
numbers an arbitrary feels

443
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,070
even though they have you know standard
forms

444
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,149
they look like in digits and they have
the checks will

445
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,900
we can go home we can go back to actual
for the most part

446
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,130
the I mean to use them

447
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,730
public versions virgins we've seen for
most prodigious grant

448
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,950
of course not talking about the
perceived results

449
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,430
the post results it also going through
it com

450
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:41,010
well depends on how much time the person
has usually manual process

451
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,040
yeah a manual process as in writing I
and our sister the take anything

452
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,780
the looks like a credit card other there
are plugins that do that the

453
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,730
they have separate programs that you
load in is use data in a par SES all the

454
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,570
interesting information

455
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,179
that you're talking the other stuff like
that surprised you didn't suggest people

456
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,090
start using flasher

457
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,870
Java to do these kinds of education and
take a nap

458
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,250
chunk well flat with Flex 4 it does a
lot of that for you so it's easier

459
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,420
if you're developing applications your
word about

460
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,260
data to use flex

461
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,990
someone and when you heard saying and

462
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,570
when you met some medication was sending
rent information to post requests

463
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,649
in javascript on you said there were
some very below on cement

464
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,420
a good said to tell the server-side that
this state data

465
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,090
ignored or this is the real data on
since this is actually post is actually

466
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,450
a lot and posted at

467
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,420
with a not be able to for example find
out what that

468
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,450
hey this is real thing as and just sort
filter out their logs

469
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,390
other the key that the arm the pay
attention key

470
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,620
is sent in to get request as as part the
javascript function

471
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,730
ok XO was going to suggest when he just
sit do something like a

472
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:01,020
in your post requests how to get
variable on colic and fake equals 1 yeah

473
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,080
yes that's what that's what we do we not
release get verbal we send it

474
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,750
with the javascript function that loads
we have the

475
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,470
the young to pay attention i think im
this

476
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,640
tumor size what about if used like God

477
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,180
chasing in San its CC

478
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,720
CCK whatever that string

479
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,890
continued as has at work with opposed to
rate payers is like

480
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,910
having to go through and figure out what
things you put

481
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,390
yeah I mean have UGC because just

482
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,130
house just was mister

483
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,620
we're focusing really on the client side
and methods to send over there

484
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,740
to send it back radiation

485
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,140
give you can created create a string
from the whole project

486
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:54,140
here on the client side insanity age

487
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,480
hi spycam that client-side you know if
running as a

488
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,540
Windows restricted user prevents this is
infection in the first place

489
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:09,010
i've seen infects users fun home

490
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,870
I'm not sure

491
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,070
that would prevent because usually its
its exploits

492
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,450
if a lot a lot of the infections get
there

493
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,810
through users saying yes

494
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:27,530
through some sort so she was fired yeah
at ninety percent of the night that

495
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,520
we've run into is some form of social
engineering

496
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,600
and sole person purposely installs with
L

497
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,170
but its no hard to the point being
restricted users you can install

498
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,490
anything

499
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,260
it's not that simple but a superior yeah

500
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,610
I we really haven't explored that too
much but what we've seen a nobody ever

501
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,900
runs a restricted user

502
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,110
yeah but the infected machines we've
seen on

503
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,780
on botnets has been

504
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,149
I've seen corporate machines i've seen

505
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,410
cash registers see users

506
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:07,470
we've even seen safe tokens

507
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,860
calling Lord POST request so you say
most antivirus programs K

508
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,860
cedar detective have you detected hun we
detect yet

509
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,300
I we monitor traffic and phone

510
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,390
eyes conserve rc4 for today to that was
up for

511
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,750
every half hour

512
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,090
thank you

513
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,490
it seems like part of the issue here is
not be you trying to make it

514
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,470
impossible break you trying to meet your
data not worth the time

515
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,860
because they move on to the next yes
exactly we're trying them

516
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,350
were trying to mitigate most of the
botnet users by frustrating them

517
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,080
completely and having them go on to more
vulnerable sites

518
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,730
which third seems to be times really
want to the going

519
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,940
traffickers on from zoos

520
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,940
so much time this is but if United Bank
as you mentioned maybe you're a softer

521
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,670
target this night is worth their time

522
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:06,090
yes and they might because it is close
only yes

523
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,160
yes i it seems that

524
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,250
hurt your strategy here is she just
explained

525
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,560
is to make the data that your modified
sites generate

526
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,300
the work less to the but mister yes
that's another strategy that we look

527
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,600
up if you thought about taking it a step
further

528
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,770
where the botnet my esters seems

529
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,770
to them it looks like they've got real
credit card data but it's stuff that

530
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,570
you've generated that's fake credit card
data

531
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,679
so it gets farther up the chain in

532
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,160
in the middleware market before it's
finally discovered to be bad

533
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,080
seems like that would push the the
countermeasure higher up the strategic

534
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,790
levels

535
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,080
with that work yeah act it would
somewhat work

536
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,140
home surprisingly a lot on the low tech
my masters can

537
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:58,000
the memorize the the buildup in the
makeup of what a credit card is

538
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,610
a lot of them can immediately look at a
credit card number tell fits me P so

539
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,190
sacred american express

540
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,990
and generally word comes from so but we
did look into

541
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,639
arm algorithms generated that does it
but there's

542
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,089
a lot at the BART masters Inc in
Carter's actually have

543
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,100
forms to do checks so immediately when
they get a list credit card numbers

544
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,159
the run it through these checkers which
are of third-party applications

545
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,489
or other programs to see if it is a
valid number

546
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:31,010
not so it's committed date me to get
there pretty quick leon

547
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,510
there and through through checkers a lot
of times the use

548
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,580
not-for-profit foundations to run a
dollar

549
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,210
donation to check the credit cards and
if the dollar donation goes through the

550
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,350
nutcrackers

551
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,489
I'm still a little bit disturbed that
you think that office cation works in

552
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,710
the real world

553
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,480
at any practical level I'm because

554
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,410
mean aren't these people Hatchell aren't
they motivate it actually

555
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:05,140
crack to stuff in if they see bad data
coming down from a big side

556
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,240
for some financial target go to start
doing the analysis they'll

557
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,960
start fielding to get data and

558
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,740
supply yet circles a dedicated
individuals that actually build plugins

559
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,520
and stuff we're looking at it from a
general population how agile

560
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,320
are they in fact based on history

561
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,940
im how involving reassignment you for
like plugins installed here

562
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,410
i've seen

563
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,480
the really pretty quickly year bullet I
mean which ironically with percentages

564
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,210
trend games was writing the code we're
trying to get the other

565
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,700
bodies of right I have I'm all in favor

566
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,240
dirty tricks if they work I mean if you
can spoil what are these guys Saturday

567
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,020
night

568
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,150
every Saturday night for a year

569
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,390
maybe I'll go somewhere else

570
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,600
so on the subjective dirty tricks how
well code it is

571
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,580
use and the back end you take another
step inject something naughty into

572
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,620
post bail screw up the back in scripted
a minor

573
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,430
review now owns is we've actually
looking to

574
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:20,109
cross-site scripting apps use

575
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,330
yeah yeah

576
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,819
people to a lot actually

577
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,040
from they they're not all bodies

578
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,250
and they attack each other along with us

579
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,530
yes so you'll get guys from

580
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,650
yes kinda nasty stuff I've

581
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:46,940
yeah I've actually run into some really
well written code

582
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,890
that would automatically search

583
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,470
and takeover sues botnets

584
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,370
and install their own on all their
clients

585
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,670
its yeah I've seen some pretty

586
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,050
impressive PHP scripts on you will
actually have

587
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,710
some examples in this down hack Miami
booth

588
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,860
soul if anybody wanted have like long
detailed discussions we can definitely

589
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,920
do that

590
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:21,420
as earlier questions on to answer that
enough for you

591
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,160
russians a couple things tomorrow
various other 9:30

592
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,910
glasses questions see calls

593
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,920
stellar and we have our server ok

594
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,820
if you come up future seeking on Misrata
yourself
