1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,090
its speaks

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,600
an hello everyone

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,110
and thanks for coming here tonight I

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,980
my name's Peter swim I am a blogger and
chief musician

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,630
i block free website name church it til
death acecomm

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,299
you can is that right now if you like
well we set up

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,890
i'm joined on the stage name hour with a
etching his position at

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,410
Germany I am records as animal style an
aged

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,130
musician his West DJ

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,719
we had this argument earlier today this
list Don Miller

11
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,890
who is forms is no carrier

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,170
they're also the organizers a a monthly

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,559
in philadelphia need eat static which
you can learn about he said network

14
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm hey where's teasers he doesn't
forget the name the event I

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,300
we're going to start in the beginning

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,369
and dizzy calmly walking toward history
I'm not gonna go over I love the fax

17
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:08,900
I you can 3 the many debates on how this
bridge in an online but

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,820
all-star this basic back achieve music
is music that is produced real time

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,130
of classic hardware from the 80's and
sometimes nineties

20
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,259
so you'll have your honor systems like
the Nintendo Entertainment System

21
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,250
at the comer 64 computer the second
Genesis

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,540
and Nintendo Gameboy I am

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,240
and what these artists and musicians do
is they take the hardware using either

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,820
software they develop themselves

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,130
or the acquired or purchased from other
developers

26
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,408
an easy to create original works music

27
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,700
and visual art and movies and games and
stuffed

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,700
we're still waiting on the projector so
still well

29
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,420
my my second is less visual in your guys
I I think I could just like look over

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,180
and talk I

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,890
you guys only disagreed words a go
through and Sadie

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,670
I think next in line I where to start
with the early days

33
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,010
and what was to music am you have to go
back to the ET's

34
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,410
and it's a large part and accidental
discovery I

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,690
you have eights offer in the eighties
for common 64

36
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,640
other hardware systems disturbing and
floppy disk

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,170
and with the advent Baltimore systems
you start seeing people

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,569
share these games and files with each
other I'm sure most have you have

39
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,569
downloaded a crack

40
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,379
well or have friends down to crack I

41
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,480
there while it's installing here like a
happy little game music

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,649
%um psychiatrist nestle

43
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,500
tune and then you continue installing
software well the game software

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,870
originally used as as a kind of calling
card for their crack you know

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,319
I have gay max and

46
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,629
I cracked copy protection act for anyone
else did so I'm gonna put a little

47
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:04,760
greet screen on the front says and its
own so crew did this

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,420
and weeee wanna get shot at our friends
n

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,690
check out more for cracks in where the
best and

50
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,609
beginning and this was very simple you
know I just feel like a couple lines

51
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,300
attacks may be a scroller

52
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,470
now and as I got more and more complex

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,970
as I got more more complex they would
add things like

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,510
graphical home and see what code little
graphic animations

55
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,329
and eventually this %ah recording music
I the music

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,769
you know would be Lake fanfares or
something simple but as the production

57
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:36,950
became more and more

58
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,269
sophisticated you would find that day

59
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,150
music and graphics are often better than
the actual game South commercial game

60
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,299
gas so endemic in point where people
didn't want to

61
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,349
have to crack a game to showcase the
south and these are making demo

62
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,580
productions where they would

63
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,930
you know do the most they possibly can
and six lines a coder

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,269
you know pushed much added they can add
up the program

65
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,730
so this arms race is kinda like the
Genesis

66
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,860
a the chip using the chip art scene you
know I am

67
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,500
lot of the people that worked on this
early scene eventually became

68
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,209
you mainstream programmers and
developers for software companies

69
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,940
arm but there were a number that skeptic
producing software for the community

70
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,009
an valley towards the mid to late 90's

71
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:29,699
it was kinda firmly underground because
the commercial software was moving on to

72
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:30,930
see Bay systems

73
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,669
and other piece of hardware that don't
have a sound chip in a

74
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:39,460
you know it's like would you rather
listen to you five boys Nintendo chip

75
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,460
would you rather listen to a CD audio
free tickets machine

76
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,530
by your skateboarding you know for the
man majority consumers a choice was

77
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,639
raised his machine unfortunately

78
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,290
I am but the people who like the sound
like the trackers in South still kinda

79
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:54,930
felt

80
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,340
you know a desire to do it an they
picked up these tools the developer

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,870
tools where they left off

82
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,419
and the tools enable them to incentive

83
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:09,729
you now rating registers directly to
chip in assembly programming sup they

84
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:10,219
had

85
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,690
simple interfaces like sequencers

86
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,800
and the sequencers enable them to I am

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,889
easily make music so you're no longer
limited to hard for programmers you're

88
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,940
actually

89
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,190
get more the creative types and
musicians are in town

90
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,340
and some other early software that kinda
crossed over to

91
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,840
now on programming decisions in with
things like

92
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,070
screen tracker and protractor for the
meager and then later programs for the

93
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,969
Gameboy

94
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,669
became very popular because the game was
very easy to get with Sony's artsy

95
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:43,780
programs like

96
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,110
little sound DJ which is a tractor

97
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,210
some fans in the on into that I Nana
loop which is a more cat esoteric

98
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,789
sequencers even for people who aren't

99
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,830
familiar music pick it up and start
doing things

100
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,090
on irate so

101
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,110
our past demonizing roots that we're
getting into the Micronesia care

102
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,789
my for music words that can have their
name the label

103
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,900
and seen in europe which was the first
really embrace

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,580
this a.m.

105
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,068
I'm I use this time to please turn off
your cell phone I don't mean compares is

106
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,240
gone the front but

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,600
only bleeps and bloops you see here
today are coming from a pure

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,729
irate so Micah music about whether

109
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,340
as a European collective who now has
route all over the world San Francisco

110
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,720
and England

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,550
African okay sheesh

112
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,610
I am Micah music

113
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,440
is a a European collective musicians and
their kind of unique in the sense that

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,940
they word bind together not to make demo
productions

115
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,650
or two showcase the technology but they
want to make new

116
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,210
interesting music with the software
that's been developed so

117
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,210
then see that the competition was other
demos seen urs

118
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,789
or other seniors they were going after
you know topic label people

119
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,710
wanted to make songs to compete with his
passion Odin

120
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,729
that mainstream electronic artist at
Baker up with

121
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,430
so and Mike music is also the first

122
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,120
achieve music movement the axes

123
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,410
interested in playing for outside groups
you know before you head Emma seen

124
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,650
parties which are basically Lake

125
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,000
hell small hope conventions can things
where you know

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,060
a buncha guys are over and take a gap
year and showing what you can do

127
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,449
in you vote on who's the best and
Michael music was really the first

128
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,090
organization that kinda took it into a
club atmosphere where you had to compete

129
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,139
with

130
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,379
now Nirvana cover band for

131
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,539
you know like commercial music and turns
a for

132
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,650
respectability in a Sept so it was kinda

133
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,050
it was interesting because the the
approach that they took

134
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,539
that they took to do this ways to kinda
just

135
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,889
ignore any of the demoss in conventions
0 you know

136
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,280
the cliches the sound chip in when a
I'll

137
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,560
Ice Palace take a moment to describe you
know the limitations of cheese eggs on

138
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,470
ships

139
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,789
and most are the first generation
chicken sound chips

140
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:25,729
are extremely simple I am you have basic
way forms like you'd find

141
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,740
on me inexpensive synthesizer you rarely
have a fax

142
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,899
you rarely have things like Reaver been

143
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:37,990
distortion and stuff like that so you
have to program

144
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,399
what in your mind's eye is dietrich have
the effect

145
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,880
you know like if I wanna do reverbed I
play the sound choir choir you know

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
awake

147
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,719
fire you know you do that have a fact

148
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,860
and you know the ear is tracked

149
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,420
and you're on stage for Game Boy any
sound like

150
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,610
you know you got orchestra that is the
ultimate goal I love

151
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,620
you know the chip musician so arm

152
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,750
back to my point love the makermusic
people as a

153
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,890
you know assert claims get this up this
are fining more people

154
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,470
and getting more people into music who
had no idea about the demoss

155
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,589
roots and which is kinda like blown away
that you can make music on a gameboy

156
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:25,950
so I am in London next thing I'll

157
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,540
the movement also had its mir's in the
US I have

158
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,529
and 1999 students NYU

159
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,230
on Germany johnson et que no sleep and

160
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,089
minus baby and other artists iraq found
each other

161
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,820
making music on these game way platforms
and common reasons that

162
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,690
and these are two do gigs in the New
York area on

163
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,839
is kinda uphill battle first you know I
moved to New York in 2003

164
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,899
and at that point you know they had
found each other this core group of

165
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,800
musicians

166
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,690
comes a minor no sleep which I mentioned
bit shifter

167
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,579
glow mag bubbly fish I am

168
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:08,829
and there are dramatically very
different you know other than the

169
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,470
Yun the the room share hardware they're
very

170
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,600
different approaches the way they made
music but

171
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,029
you know it was such a competitive
environment in the new york music scene

172
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,019
that they quickly found themselves like
playing shows together and stuff like

173
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:23,860
that

174
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,870
and you'd see a lot of them

175
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,329
you see a lot of a.m. shows a galleries

176
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,420
and that other new media events I'm

177
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,469
hacker spaces such as that arm

178
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,410
but I wasn't really into like two or
three years into it that they are able

179
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,510
to cross over

180
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,510
in New York into the professional music
scenes IOM

181
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,700
an even then it was it was kinda they an

182
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,390
have a crap shoot you know you would
have one night where you're playing a

183
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,519
gallery

184
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,769
and computer speakers repair PA you know

185
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,709
and you'd show up and very early they
realize that

186
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,920
they were gonna get a leg up from the
commercial music scene 2

187
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,519
you know play bigger venues on their own
so

188
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,620
they are able to mom connect with a
local arts organization copper tank

189
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,930
which is up here in midtown Manhattan
and it was a chance to check out they do

190
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,260

191
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,310
great events theater dance

239
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,860
just going to use Adium have your own
shows and have your own venue

240
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,480
and around that time we had email from

241
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,960
number musicians from Japan who working

242
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,800
over the Internet who wanted to play a
show here

243
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,730
an it was kind of too big for the past
five years and that's kinda burned for

244
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,839
the first but that's all

245
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,319
up with assholes an hour concert have
we've had heard

246
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,800
for years now I am and

247
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,169
it's had a you know and the average of
thirty to forty artist

248
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,660
and we can from all over the world
Australia Japan

249
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,600
UK on China and

250
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,900
what this is really done for the new
york seen as kind of like

251
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,830
allowed us to connect with other ours
elsewhere

252
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,629
I am an there probably would have been
possible without without web sites like

253
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,960
I a pic collective I am the will sound
DJ mailing this was a really early

254
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,270
connection point for artists I am forms
like shit is a go at work now

255
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,720
I am and the Internet is really cannot
wake

256
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,170
essential for us to gay any Catholic
networking

257
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,230
I had to share resources how it's made
because there's certainly a lot of

258
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,350
arcane questions we get you know

259
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,409
like you know where's the game you're
playing you know

260
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,700
where is you know our what are you doing
onstage

261
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,410
you know dancing and jumping on folding
tables our

262
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:23,020
so the Internet has been really kind of
like our showcase because every time

263
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,040
you know media organization has tried to
you you know talk to your dad sec day

264
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,520
you get you know the Mario at a rave
reference are you get

265
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,520
and the guys and Fox News Lake now

266
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,850
chips a hoy down South as many Ponzi
could be

267
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,530
let the chips live they may for tomorrow
you know I am

268
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,520
break and a we've learned early on that
we have to you

269
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,879
you know runner on image because if you
let them

270
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,310
pigeonhole you is kind of like make some
novelty

271
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,139
act in a lake now I don't offend any
barbershop fans in the audience

272
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,500
anything by down you knowi its

273
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,020
it's a serious you know in maybe have a
juvenile sources music but is a serious

274
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,200
tool and as such you know you go online

275
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,750
to find resources there is quickly
becoming a lot of places that you can

276
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,100
learn how to do things to talk about the
artist

277
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,090
and that's how I like the chief departed
the scene where you have

278
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,439
you know as a person who only knew

279
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,810
no sleep in them from I will sound DJ
mailing lists a Lambo dear

280
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,870
I introduce myself but it wasn't like
breaking into a stranger cuz I knew them

281
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,670
from the internet and

282
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,510
it happen time and time again we really
ya strange comes up and says you know

283
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,710
I make a little music here and there and
then they play pulse wave

284
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,030
and then there really something on I'm

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,390
factor

312
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,110
you know there's a visceral traction to
making music on the honors

313
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,230
have hardware on and

314
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,920
where to find a good shit you know
there's a there is the

315
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,980
with the crease man and usage you know
there's Greece amount that we can chat

316
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,880
as it were I am so netlabels are very
important

317
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,970
in terms of for the casual listener on

318
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,780
a bit people's is a great label as I
said cause kidney rock

319
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,500
II there's a european Lina you victim

320
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,630
microM using is still active and Europe
they do a

321
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,610
quality filter system where their
experts 15 sciences evaluator chip be

322
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,450
sick for two

323
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,820
highest surgeon he's a quality and I

324
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,419
you may say what you will about their
secretive process but all the songs are

325
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,320
very good

326
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,639
I am but you know that you can get

327
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,380
is deep into it as you want to you know
there's a you know

328
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,130
the stuff that filters on to the
mainstream block Press I can catch em

329
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,080
point point

330
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm wanna do is turn over to Joey now
who tell you a little bit about how the

331
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,030
music made

332
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,300
animal a more technical detail and I
think if you can

333
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:31,110
so is doing man

334
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,390
okay %uh so other question end up on a

335
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,700
on the search this thing here's up what
is a chip music

336
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,170
and Dom basically it's el you know we
forms created from sense that we're

337
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,960
inside all computers

338
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,970
night is a computers because you know
than nintendo's computer

339
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,120
calmer 64's computer and Dom also

340
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,190
ice again to fight off guys back in like
2005

341
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,660
%uh on these forums they would be like
gophers are coming up from a chip

342
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,150
snatch a tune you know is there a bit
like very purist

343
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,410
and literal but it can also be emulation
up to the waveforms basically because

344
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,740
there's a lot of

345
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,850
people who don't necessarily have money
to shell out on all the

346
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,740
different equipment and all gadgets you
can buy it can improve your sound so

347
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,820
and someone may even be programmer heavy
settle actually build their own like

348
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,810
VirtualCenter

349
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,440
om you know in like a PC environment or
Mac firemen

350
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,540
so um so I just kinda like to say it's a

351
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,700
sound sources originating from the IC
chips

352
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,980
typically vintage in nature and they're
usually limited and sound

353
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,700
on you know and usually lyndon in number

354
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,620
outputs and Mike options as peter is
talking about the echo effect you could

355
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,790
do by just

356
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,970
you know which is your volume before om

357
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,310
so you know and also its kinda have its
age its genre music that's very

358
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,000
difficult to define and salsa too
dangerous to define

359
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,380
to find because I you know you could buy
a shitstorm on the forms to

360
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,710
because these kids will go go crazy if
you start you know defining stuff so

361
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,570
I think we all know the Internet is
equally interested in music as isn't

362
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,120
rolling

363
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,440
she answer oMG

364
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,470
so I just put up your you know is not
marry a music

365
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,530
you know that's that's something that
peter is talking about you know we get

366
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,990
pigeonholed into that kinda category

367
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,690
because it's normal people to see nooo
it sounds like Mary a music or something

368
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,920
but you know they're

369
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,730
bike back here you know you can have all
these various waveforms

370
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,750
way a lot of different affects arm

371
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,630
that you're doing in that really has
nothing to do with Mariola has more to

372
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,820
do with programming and Dom

373
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,080
and although an electronic music and all
those kinds of things

374
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,580
so you know I try to stay away from that
whole

375
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,980
that whole thing there are docking wrong
I like

376
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,910
a lot of the old video game music and I
probably wouldn't get into this music

377
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,400
led

378
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,780
had that have that make initial kind of
catalyst

379
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,580
but you know it at some point when your
car is you gotta go you gotta

380
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,620
kinda branch out basically so om

381
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,920
these are just a couple pictures of us
some situates they're all the different

382
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,100
revisions over them

383
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:15,100
you know this is a a this is stuff that
I like to look at on the Internet

384
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,540
yes anarchy yeah this is a little chip
musica

385
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,290
chipper musician pornography writer arm

386
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,639
so why chip music okay I am

387
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,810
so creating electronic music

388
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,360
within limitations from another era it's
challenging you know

389
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,840
you don't have %uh some crazy commercial
a interface that she can deal with a can

390
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,660
do

391
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,460
you know pretty much anything you can
think of so you have to sort of it's our

392
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,580
forces you to be creative

393
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,879
arm you know and also to are if you're
using hardware

394
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,660
you gonna get certain artifacts in the
actual

395
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,310
you know timbers and sounds that you're
creating within their and it's in

396
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,020
perfect

397
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,580
you know in perfect imperfections that
are gonna make

398
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,629
by you know you know

399
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,860
your sound sound good basically so I
like the way the side

400
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,060
the sting sound when a IC chip doesn't
exactly do everything you thought it was

401
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,240
going to do

402
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,740
arm it sounds good om so also you know
the noise your mom hated

403
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,070
you know my mom would be like a can you
put your headphones on with a gameboy

404
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,550
because it becoming a speaker you know
it's not like you rock n roll music you

405
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:24,820
know

406
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,270
and that there's nothing more beautiful
than that I mean they've you know their

407
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,900
parents hated their music

408
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,710
maternity my music so it's it's pretty
good like this so

409
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,210
also to um art within limitations

410
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,400
arm I like to use the Star Wars example
we all know that the new Star Wars movie

411
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,790
stock

412
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:46,440
but the old ones are awesome because
they didn't have all this crazy

413
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,010
technology to deal with

414
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,169
you know and they could they were
created with what they had

415
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:56,169
you know and a it actually made use your
imagination a lil bit more so

416
00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:00,300
that's a beauty a budget in music as
well to so and I also like to

417
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,890
pass on some are commercial software
here sell commercial software sorta like

418
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,909
a shallow girlfriend

419
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,310
looks hot but your fridge might begin
around the block you know like every

420
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,389
season it

421
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,960
pushy cost too much to take out all the
time you know so the initial cross a

422
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,470
bite some commercial software is

423
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,690
you know it's crazy you know why

424
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,350
why even go by those things when you can
not download family tracker for free

425
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,360
you know you mean it's an open source
program you can start reading music

426
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,120
right away

427
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,919
you know you bought a computer you know
I feel like summer software should be

428
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,880
definitely free so

429
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,690
you know if you go by Propellerheads
reason or something like that you know

430
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,540
itself you know Salah Amani shop in the
beginning

431
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,389
and a lot of people point out is so on
so and also to you know

432
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,720
nostalgia is powerful you know watch out
barrio now as you were each year career

433
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,300
for breakfast basically you know

434
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,000
says so if you play into that too much
you know people to see more take you

435
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,530
seriously

436
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,940
and on you know just it counted

437
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,690
demoralized hearts arm but yet recycle
reuse and rock

438
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,810
so that's another thing you know up you
know we talk about recycling all time

439
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,100
%uh what's better than recycling like
all the

440
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,290
video games from the past account using
them for future that's like

441
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,139
that's something that's I think it's
something beautiful and definitely

442
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,530
related to a

443
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,678
stuff it's going on now are

444
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,370
okay so there's a but a different ways
you can actually make chiptune music

445
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,190
I'm I put up here there's an ML you can
use me D

446
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,340
which is musical instrument digital
interface and then you could use media

447
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,900
trackers switches

448
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,210
what I have on this game were right now
it's a tracker where you can actually

449
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,280
write music but button presses on the
Game Boy or you can use a PC tracker to

450
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,010
which is like something that you would
write music

451
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,908
on your computer with okay so um

452
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:53,919
your music macro language if you if you
google search

453
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,510
MML you're gonna get something that says
music markup language in that something

454
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,100
different

455
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,360
okay and um no sleep actually the guy

456
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,679
the last case on the video basically he
has a

457
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,000
job its light his shoes wet tits website
pro-life for a specific reason

458
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,830
he is a MCK NML beginners tutorial on
his website so

459
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,980
arm so that's one way if you're heavy
into programming

460
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,330
you wanna mess around with it you might
be even more comfortable with like it

461
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,760
and then I'll kinda thing

462
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,600
so our media hardware there's tons in
these options now

463
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,990
on there's like things you can buy this
meaty nests

464
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,960
there's all sorts serve others aren't we
know boy which is a something that

465
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,060
trashy eighty me to believe he actually
played here

466
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,408
at one time Rd why don't I see pictures
have had them him here

467
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:45,070
ballpoint sober he made a whole lot MIDI
interface for the Gameboy

468
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,010
on through Arduino and then I V blank
who is here

469
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,740
he's going to do in visuals leader he
built a R YM surf its

470
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,470
got some atari features and Dom little
scare has a release this year but he is

471
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,010
the

472
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,220
me to MIDI interface for Sega Genesis

473
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,230
there's also this thing called messiah
which is another

474
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,650
up is a common or interface that uses
many

475
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,370
arm the the options are endless there's
tons of things okay

476
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,669
arm and then I have over here there's a
link here i know it. obviously guys can

477
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:15,500
click on it

478
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,300
but I A I oMG liquid yeah if you

479
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,700
if you google search a Mughal charm up

480
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,270
trackers something like that armour
charm ever been as Google or so maybe it

481
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,940
sounds like that he can remember that

482
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,650
up but they have a with a

483
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,720
oh yeah that's what the exact all but
they have a list I'm almost

484
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,020
every track or you could possibly
imagine on their website %uh

485
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,908
need trackers and PC tracker so and most
of them are free

486
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:48,370
so now you guys should try or something
good up so LSD is really popular

487
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,570
on MPC trackers are for people who have
money to

488
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,158
shelhah hardware so Scott computer

489
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:00,460
and its so l this is a picture LSDJ on a
EMS flashcard and you

490
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,380
basically put the LST G ROM onto the
flash cart

491
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,240
with the USB cable and then you can save
your songs with the

492
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,820
it saves them with a battery backup
basically so if your battery go so your

493
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,408
songs

494
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:16,380
but you can backing up your computer to
I also use a

495
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,990
Sega Genesis flash car to from my Sega
Genesis music in this is a total tech

496
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,050
Andy pro 64 flashcard arm

497
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,629
and it uses a serial cable so a lot of
people don't want to use it because they

498
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,400
don't have serial port honor that
printer port on the back

499
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,440
here anymore but um

500
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,980
its see also people use the

501
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,360
just a standard mixer a lotta times to
mom

502
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,220
help the sound of the the Gameboy or
other

503
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,090
you know things are deploying and on the
EQ you can bump the bass

504
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,960
on and it's also useful if you have a
good DJ style approach to

505
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,270
where you like beat matching in you know
putting

506
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,260
may be using to game was at the same
time for something because it'll

507
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,530
independent control

508
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,310
and a can also use in like you're
recording chain so if you wanna get in

509
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,639
the queue before you actually record
your songs

510
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,880
some people like to actually record
hardware

511
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,090
so and then I put up here

512
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,280
that sorry but a video before there was
like early days have my stuff so

513
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,000
II I'm very ashamed actually I

514
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,390
very but that the stuff that I worked on
after that %uh

515
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,800
Ahmad I'm a guitar teacher and ima I
have a jazz guitar degree so I want to

516
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,850
come up with a way to cut improvise

517
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:37,050
arm chip music so what I did was I built
a gameboy for controller

518
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,320
so that I could trigger group with my
foot in and play guitar over top of it

519
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,610
and then I also are got a guitar pedal
that kinda makes my guitar to a square

520
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,310
wave

521
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,730
so that Tom you know you and you dislike
like

522
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,820
game would be nelson's its weird tar
sound over top

523
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,918
everything with some kind of %uh you
know

524
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,150
one texture almost basically so lucky
because min ago I don't know what you're

525
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,940
doing on the guitar but it on a good
okay

526
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,440
I also built a recently a homebrew are
to me know CBC concern that have stepped

527
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,800
on my pedal so that it on

528
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,820
can see Chris the polls with my guitar
and %uh that's like a

529
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,290
very standard thing that one the NES
could do

530
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,300
for the comer 64 to do and %uh you know
I like to add

531
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,830
I played sagesse sagesse as well as
light so

532
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,909
I make a lot of music with that and all
user yamaha DX 100 that because as a

533
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,100
similar

534
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,659
sound chip and it's a keyboard basically
so has a similar sound ship to Sega

535
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:33,460
Genesis

536
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,179
so again I was kinda do try to come go
about that the same way

537
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:42,150
as my good pulse guitar thing to keep
the textures the same basically

538
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,990
so so here's some my jock

539
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,290
that's the secrets are built this is the

540
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,908
the top you know the game with work for
controller basically just census which

541
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:55,080
is down to a breakout box I can

542
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:02,080
hit two buttons with foot

543
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,899
okay so yet there's a buncha hardware
modifications you can do

544
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,950
you know I was just talking about like
the full control over everything but

545
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,949
I you know there's a process on output
for a pizza sums

546
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,049
you know people overclock under clock
there %uh game boys

547
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,990
are people back late the game boys so
that they can seat in the club cuz it's

548
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,280
really hard

549
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,909
is also a crystal clear %ah passing mod
for the Sega Genesis it you can do

550
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:31,450
anti-noise c64 mothers endless
possibilities you can do

551
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,460
and I put it and here you can be
creative and try to come up with your

552
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,230
own unique approach that's always good

553
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,260
arm and also to have a you know people
have been

554
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,480
%uh increasingly sort of like not just

555
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,960
doing what I'm doing to keep the
textures the same but they'll bill

556
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,360
basically a integrated with other
instruments

557
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,669
Anamanaguchi who's a new york-based
bennett star scream

558
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:58,020
they both have like drummers and bass
players and guitars and all these things

559
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,250
and they make like a whole

560
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,520
rock show out a bit I have to shop here
glow mag Chris playing guitar and he has

561
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,160
a lot of vocals with it

562
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,850
arm dinos can be fine leader he plays a

563
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:13,080
keyboard with the and there's a guy and
hear John better

564
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,710
back in is a new Philly guy who's also
point keyboards and everything like that

565
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,530
so let people use conventional
instruments with us up to I don't you

566
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,380
think it's just always just here have my
game way in

567
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,800
that's it are but also cross-genre
compatibility

568
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,800
om all game soundtracks pretty much

569
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,830
covered every John Reid jerry can pick
up so out these guys tried actually in

570
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,640
corporate a

571
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,830
a corporate does into their music so

572
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,180
mom you know it has a curse

573
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,649
seems to have a good John responding
ability basically where we just kind of

574
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,550
like absorb all these different genres
is also becoming

575
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:53,570
a new genre because that so on and many
types musicians have experimented with

576
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,420
chip music

577
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,619
arm from popular musicians like back
actually

578
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:02,400
Tom to experimental musicians like
oliver which al from Germany

579
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,660
so and there's like a pretty much in our
open-minded us nature in seen arm

580
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,750
is for genre and musical tastes Co
there's a lot of people go about a lot

581
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,970
of different ways

582
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,900
so on also covering non-electronic songs
extremely common

583
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,560
and it sorta brings a casual listener in
up

584
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,259
so you're sequencing music makes it easy
to play down stuff that might otherwise

585
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,610
be hard or impossible to so if you're
not really good at playing want sell

586
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,400
music you can always sequences

587
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,030
the game we played a part for you at
some stuff and I do if I can play it on

588
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,880
guitar 0

589
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,700
a two-game way to do it and this so
we're not official list the

590
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,740
talk a second and %uh so II you know if
you aren't getting it to chill music you

591
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,840
got a visual us

592
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,480
so you know getting the visuals to make
you a call you might want to give us

593
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,090
from

594
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,260
alcohol for some money or given some
praise

595
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,560
you know his support to publicly thank
him

596
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,220
because they provide the atmosphere and
movie I just the music he knows the

597
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,010
visuals are really important part in
there they're like the base where they

598
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,780
always get

599
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,790
sort of like you know it's like after 20
years like

600
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,180
our style by endo carriers something
like dat by I

601
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,879
I does more than I'd I do have to agree
that when I first started booking as

602
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,290
possible shows

603
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,000
ice on the website I am I ate new as
good book

604
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,580
musicians and then someone said 00 a.m.

605
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,640
and a.m. visuals who records is Paris
graphics

606
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,819
wants to BG for the show and Mike iraq

607
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,360
how a split the bill that much you know
I had tweet we don't really need it

608
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,570
any you know they talked me into letting
him perform %um

609
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,020
money him and he blew me away it's very
you know

610
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,820
I i think you have what to do with how
the medically were used to the graphics

611
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,940
and music together

612
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,240
and it really does kind of glue the two
things again is our firm we have

613
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,430
to artists at the top of their game
doing their thing and some eternity done

614
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:51,940
right now

615
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,000
talking about the gym thanks

616
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,369
on

617
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:03,580
so arm again yes he said on ship visuals
are eight so on

618
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,200
is something that if you don't know much
about should music you probably know

619
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,619
very little or nothing about

620
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,730
chip visuals and I'm you hear the term
Vishal issue popular term vj before

621
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,440
I V J might mean something different
here from Europe than it does in america

622
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,900
but a time share American you think BJ
oh I've seen as hosts on MTV dir the

623
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,700
ones endangers the videos the top 20
countdown

624
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,250
30 from europe you probably think the VJ
as someone who is

625
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:31,020
at a club providing visuals for a DJ and
that's what we're talking about here

626
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,430
I would use the term vision lost a lot
and down what's the difference you care

627
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,690
so I'm gonna cares

628
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,490
there's a difference arm mostly up and I
say visualized

629
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,590
I'm usually talking real time verses
prereq pre-rendered

630
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,040
as we say live is a list a thinker that
is different from VJ

631
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,740
VJ video Jackie you're playing video
clips where

632
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,800
on when I think it's meant to visualize
I think if someone that is using dynamic

633
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,590
content in real time

634
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,740
using a variety of different arms of a
higher options

635
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,920
various computers various consoles but
most often usually somebody vintage

636
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,040
our computers and consuls eight see
people making music on

637
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:12,000
and like joey said it helps complete the
experience for the concert attendee

638
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,020
right and watch officials again on

639
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,130
dynamic visuals versus static movie
clips i've seen. VJ's before who

640
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,410
wailed take a haircut from Star Wars
raid and at affects 28 near

641
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,060
motion blur but you know I do so much to
static movie clip but if you have

642
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,140
endemic fish or that you can control I i
think that something

643
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,970
much better again Chris clear but out
the resolution a static that is a

644
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,810
Munich for some people probably the
people that are coming to the Chi music

645
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,930
shows to begin with

646
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,368
and finally again to police experience
for the viewers this year's picture

647
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:46,580
oxygen star playing at a monthly eight
static in philadelphia

648
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:51,770
as a wig on and uS officials by V blank
is performing at tonight's chicken

649
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,640
concert and I'll continue to promote
throughout

650
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,000
the rest at this time and

651
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,640
again different techniques before chip
visuals just says there's

652
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,779
as I chose had this many different types
I love music

653
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,550
choices have the same thing for visuals
ever most every visuals though has a

654
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,930
different set up in style

655
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,040
where there's a lot more software
available a gusty day for the Gameboy

656
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,009
for music

657
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,940
a lot of people doing video myself
included tend to write their own

658
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,900
software

659
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,770
or build their own hardware and few
programs like I said exist

660
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:26,040
on and it's very common to see custom
setups

661
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,400
summer talk a little bit about local
chip Vishal iz ones I and down

662
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,050
very erotic so I put this in the order
of people I've worked with in

663
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,240
chronologically

664
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,690
because you need to know that Thomas L
I'm first time on a 10 does a great guy

665
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,180
I saw some is visuals

666
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,759
and other video that Peter show he's
been doing it a long time his circuit

667
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,970
bad hardware

668
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,060
distant NDC right here the patch bays
his work Paris graphics used to be known

669
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,259
as voltage-controlled

670
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,880
our new york city as well rights custom
software

671
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,730
I V Blanca German from Philadelphia on
he'll be the concert tonight

672
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,880
he does custom software and hardware so
he's like

673
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,119
kinda thinking hybrid the first you guys
and %uh finally and so it is pixel art

674
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:07,410
and

675
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,649
animation which again has its place in
shit music visuals because if you think

676
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,340
a lot of the order video games

677
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,550
the animation John pixel by pixel arm
animations and frame by frame there's no

678
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,119
training there's no 3d models in the Ori

679
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,210
I games so that pixel static kinda holds
true for

680
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,260
visual performance in the chip seen

681
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,470
Nintendo this is a picture wanna miss
consoles and again you can see the dials

682
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,630
and switches its

683
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,150
on circuit bent and up here some
pictures um

684
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,280
a performance he did I believe in Prague
last year and you can see this very

685
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,220
glitchy

686
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,420
armistead it but he's kinda become known
for and on his

687
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,600
work is very amazing and down II

688
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,090
he's been doing this for a long time and
very recognizable when you see

689
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:54,010
%uh his stuff up on ustream Paris
graphics on this is sum up his

690
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,950
artwork arm when we re in Denmark last
year for blip Europe

691
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,420
and on as you can see here there's
patterns at a procedurally generated by

692
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,530
summers offer that he writes as much
different feel than that glitchy random

693
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,720
circuit bent our stuff that no tendered
us

694
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,119
on he also incorporates on you know I

695
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,359
and recognizable imagery in there almost
like traditional

696
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,759
%ah VJs that mike is movie clips but
again on

697
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,330
kinda badges on twist to it with some of
his ass offer that he writes on his own

698
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:27,150
the blank again he'll be out tonight you
should definitely come the chip concert

699
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,320
later we'll have the details

700
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,440
Canada's top and out this is sum up this
custom software

701
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,240
discard the pocket the Black Keys begin
be selling this after using

702
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,840
his circuit board on his bread board
version at concerts and this is

703
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,140
something you can buy

704
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,640
and you can plug in your own music and
visuals react in real time

705
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,000
on this is another one of his shots
armor from our show at Philadelphia

706
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,210
and sell again on his ex libris so all
these

707
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,980
logos this year this one for tony lake
chrome maximises for a rival

708
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,960
he does these pixel by pixel so these
aren't fonts these are things that he's

709
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,550
drawn

710
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,550
see takes an incredible amount of time
to prepare although he's not

711
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,270
programming is on software he's expense

712
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,100
as much if not more time on
painstakingly laying things out

713
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,480
arm to make sure everything's right and
out is another design appears

714
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,190
on this is an its static logo he did
this is projected on a wall

715
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,970
in this is %ah it is ecstatic and that's
a a rip off of that Castlevania string

716
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,980
and a but a lot of work into that and
his stuff is very stunning live in hell

717
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,320
also be performing

718
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,890
this evening he did the poster yes if
you see there's a there's very few these

719
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,009
posters around they've

720
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,550
understood there for sale later which is
interesting because especially promotion

721
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,880
on but a

722
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,420
you may find them later at around
finally

723
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,359
up my chip visuals I performer the name
no carrier as a picture again from our

724
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,509
show in Philly

725
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,820
I O mostly use of I've written for the
NES

726
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,990
and down reside in the picture via

727
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:59,550
mine from a tank in New York City and
again on

728
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,700
I have Ramos offer for any as Commodore
64 it I 2600

729
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,520
a number of different consoles and arm

730
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,650
you know when I really got into this
site I at one reason that really I was

731
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,680
interested in the church music scene

732
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,460
I to begin with is because really like
the music and I

733
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,310
here I really enjoy going up shows but I
didn't see a lot video

734
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,080
that I thought match well with what was
going on onstage

735
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,569
site CVJ set using video clips and Mike
Leigh's geyser putting so much effort

736
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,670
into making music

737
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,600
arm and then you have this specific
doesn't really seem to fit

738
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,900
are behind them being projected being
shown so on

739
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,100
you know at an ally to work on my lawn
software and releasing it open source as

740
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,310
well and trying to really help other
people get started on that same path

741
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,070
because

742
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,310
arm I think it's really a important
thing

743
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,080
I'm to have the whole experience there I
think it makes the show a lot better

744
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,470
gonna show quick video clip I motion at
the end if we have time

745
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:58,369
at a performance arm I did with that cow
pea a Japanese guy

746
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:01,810
at Book Festival 2008 on

747
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:05,900
for someone to talk about how you can
get into it and down

748
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,450
we have a party again in Philly caught
eight static Anders

749
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,020
open mikes available a lot of shit music
ships as peter said there's a lot of

750
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,810
people getting H

751
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:18,170
music all the time so if you want to
match I your hand at playing a song you

752
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,150
can come out and play song

753
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,660
on before the main show starts 18 Sadeq
we actually start doing open Visual

754
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,140
Studio self your

755
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,509
are into making video you can come out
and why domi performers are playing

756
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,730
their songs you can try out some video

757
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,160
and years never really been a place
where you could do that before eight

758
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:35,830
static

759
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:40,330
and I it's been very successful so far
i've a number of open source

760
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,480
arm programs on my website

761
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,890
and shit music died at work has a form
for motion graphics not a fancy term

762
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,868
let live visual system makes a sound a
lot cooler than most of us are

763
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:55,710
so again a motion graphics um if you
wanna go there and check that out you

764
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,400
can see other people that might be
getting into it as well

765
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,040
on there's one thing to think about
though and I'm gonna stresses last

766
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,820
couple slides

767
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,030
a meeting is very important because on
again

768
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,880
many of you may know people at the
musicians maybe not know so many people

769
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,480
that I've

770
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,140
done live video and lighting or anything
like that but it's kinda different

771
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,160
around sometimes so again besides just
this offer the hardware if you can use

772
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,690
our laptops you gonna use nintendo's
whatever you're going to use

773
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,840
on you gonna need some type mixer I use
an air of the four

774
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,020
which is used to mix between separate
video inputs a monitor

775
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,560
you see a preview a single-channel think
a bit like a DJ right if you have a DJ

776
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,230
he's got two turntables his mix and the
Middle

777
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,240
he's got headphones to listen to the
next track the same thing you need to

778
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,720
preview its coming up

779
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,750
before you put it on the screen so again
set up a color monitor

780
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,359
hopefully arm will help you do that on
again

781
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,720
a hardware if you can use consuls think
about concerns or parts for performance

782
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,200
and especially taking these things
abroad there has been a time I've gotten

783
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,180
to another country in taking out my
suitcases my stuff for a cake in there

784
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,759
has been like a notice from

785
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,000
multiple government agencies that have
routed to my bag

786
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,650
because they see people bringing
20-year-old computer hardware through

787
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,520
security there the usually a little
curious you can imagine nintendo's

788
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,840
half yeah no tender has those circumvent
consoles that look like bombs

789
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,890
attach based on the top so I feel bad
for him

790
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,060
our computers there's concerns outputs
of course right Obama

791
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,150
most on some places that you go might
only have

792
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:28,670
aid I S Video war arm compass at line
run class alignright

793
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,990
not DJ and projector you thinking his
resolution really important if you're

794
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,210
screen resolution is 256 by 2:40 that
you're projecting

795
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,560
probably not look for projector that has
brightness or throw

796
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,990
contrast other things that are gonna be
meaningful

797
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,900
putting it all together these are two
pictures of my life set up as you can

798
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,660
see I have a

799
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,930
video mixer here a monitor right here
and to Nintendo's on each side

800
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:54,839
and this is some and is this kind of
another shot right here

801
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,170
but again on live set up it's a lot to
bring out

802
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:01,900
and I you see that later at the concert
on things to keep in mind while

803
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,330
performing again you're performing with
someone else just like joe said

804
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:09,359
on you know chic rescued officials to
mind on you know I try to keep musicians

805
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,650
in mind trade

806
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:13,859
on don't compete because if you're up
there you're performing

807
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:17,240
its it's a lot better if you're both
performing together then performing

808
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,160
against each other

809
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,410
try to upstage the person that's fine
music by you know

810
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:25,609
constantly strobing light Serena give
people seizures but this isn't you know

811
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:30,150
i mean but yet don't don't like rick
roll ham

812
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,030
try to have haces face on Rick Astley's
Bodywise performing there might be

813
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:34,800
distracting

814
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,270
have to set this has happened but have
courts

815
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,160
beat matching and counting rate if you
fuck idea how music works and you can

816
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,629
count of time signatures and you can
synchronize

817
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,849
with the musician its gonna make
experience better for everyone

818
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:51,020
when the best compliments are people
come up to me afterwards and said

819
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,540
wow how are you synchronizing arm you
know your video to his music and usually

820
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,590
like my you know

821
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,599
beer and my hands traders alike the two
tools necessary

822
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,760
and Dom that's very important rate
because it again

823
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,890
people getting into the music they may
not always remember

824
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,040
you what you're projecting but it was
synchronized to music it may be

825
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,050
meaningful enough for them to walk away

826
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:16,090
wow that was a great show not a great
musician not a great visual list but

827
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,480
everything fit I'm again on

828
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,670
different types and mixing a crime
became on how you're going to

829
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,910
put your stuff together background
foreground layers on

830
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,480
these are things at all are set to deal
with on but it's especially important

831
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,790
when you are

832
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,560
you know mice have you drinking um

833
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,710
dealing with promoters and venues this
is something again i really wanna stress

834
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,910
is a lot and I talk about this type
stuff

835
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,118
if you're doing video get in touch early
in often

836
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,420
will come much trouble we had trying to
get a projector setup here

837
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,500
for a laptop for her break before the
stock now

838
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,090
um but again get in touch early and
often know what you have and what you

839
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,710
need for something you need from the
venue tell them

840
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,820
they probably have no idea what you're
doing many time I've gotten there and

841
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,000
then set up in surrounding video tonight
there are

842
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,830
know where you got a tape I think this
is the best angle if you're trying to

843
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,770
get the stage

844
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:12,500
to know I'm not filming an iMac I'm
doing live video chat kick

845
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,890
rather talk about that facts I've hey
I've

846
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,930
yeah dad we can we don't have time
thankfully on

847
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,779
so again know exactly let them know
exactly what you do

848
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,540
don't get overlooked because if
ignorance to rate you need to let them

849
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,390
know you're doing live video and this is
what you need

850
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,810
push for proper pay and promotion most
the time

851
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,940
year as a musician you play one set for
35 minutes sometimes video

852
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:40,210
artists have to do an entire night's
worth of music but end up getting paid

853
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,660
are not nice for the video but and
getting paid less are not at all

854
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,420
user their names are left of the Flyers
so you gotta be proactive because most

855
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,250
people just don't understand

856
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,580
%uh load in when the band's tracks do
I'm not blaming

857
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,779
performer I'm not blaming these venues
all the time don't shop 10 minutes

858
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,980
before and Sarah Adams gonna set up my
table in the back and think the sound

859
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,480
guys gonna be okay with that

860
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,000
rate get there early when the bands
download an and always be over-prepared

861
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,590
on thank you very much for coming out

and for those either inched and how it
works this is the best time to

876
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:05,630
on see it up close and I guess we won't
use rather time and take some questions

877
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,160
if anyone has a question the audience it
began

878
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,690
to put your questions tuna short concise
questions

879
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:16,730
any when another microphones in the
front

880
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,910
I a rigorous

881
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,790
chariot POW white you describing
something

882
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,850
I you put your guitar through something

883
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:31,790
paul's possible if I get is a couple
that there's a great battles on

884
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:36,220
I use a there's one up by accompany
affects doctor

885
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,390
job it's basically a hike in fuzz pedal
and it just turns your guitar into a

886
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,390
square wave

887
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,450
is actually a couple DIY schematics and
a geyser can put that stuff together

888
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,690
%uh online %ah and

889
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,980
the 1i the other one that actually use a
lot to is the

890
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,800
is called the pulse munger sort of a
book boutique bed or two used its kinda

891
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,730
expensive

892
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,920
that's the 1i don't that CV sequencer I
didn't know how to

893
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,460
build the one of those pedals with a CV
outplayed which is controlled voltage

894
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,750
so that's why I bought the panel
basically so but dirt lot served their

895
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,760
skiff you like

896
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,920
lookup square wave guitar Lake eat
picket are schematic on cool you find

897
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,060
all sorts of stuff

898
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,570
om it would be cool if some some people
here got more into it

899
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,810
you know Chris and I could use your
stuff you know I

900
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,730
are and when I'm sorry he's performing
tonight if you have questions you can

901
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,600
see that stuff there

902
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,850
sir one last question I a could you
elaborate a little bit more about what

903
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,640
you meant when you were talking about
Mario music were you just

904
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,770
getting at it's not covers its not
remixes but its original work or would

905
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,210
you rate again I mean

906
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,610
the perception is like you know I have

907
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,650
i've seen video perfect interviews where

908
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:52,600
I when I first are getting a cheap music
someone had done a techno remix

909
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,300

911
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,700
