1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,900
laszlo you

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,760
here alright

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,760
moving into our Friday night it hope
your

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,110
the term is up a little bit our

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:26,110
housekeeping just a reminder

6
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,390
your

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,719
there's also the 2600 good for sale back
issues T-shirts conference T-shirts

8
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,289
I'm as well as strange money from other
countries that was smuggled out by a

9
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,019
manual

10
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:47,620
on that's got out to slow on it so

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,910
if you'd like to own some smuggle
currency

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,010
but I believe it's been a manual box
team's pants

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,199
p what's a smile but right across it

14
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,829
and less you have on those horrible body
scanners that they could see your face

15
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,550
much money and so

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,798
how tough it is to get started %uh I
would remind you that the

17
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,479
hotel Pennsylvania is the great time to
us so we're make sure what this

18
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,310
information that you do no harm

19
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,750
there's a lot of hotels within a few
blocks a

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,860
they were not associated with it so

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,040
%ah

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,450
as the old saying goes don't shit where
you eat

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,390
they don't serve the Lord don't shit
where you had

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,210
a if you're not familiar with till

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,470
this organization has released some
amazing videos online

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,679
come locks that people claim are
unbreakable

27
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:50,179
non hackable up in seconds are opened
its

28
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:54,479
makes you feel really safe in your own
home other website is a is a good

29
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,750

ever look at it check that out and I
believe that you guys are downstairs at

31
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,130

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,189
ya so you can if you want to sit down
and go hands-on and try to

33
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,890
try to pick a lock the real definitely
help you out to bring the lock picks the

34
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,599

yes I was gonna come later yeah

36
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,840
I I can attest to their how well these
work because I locked myself out drunk

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,430
and I was able to pick its my own home
but she worked out well

38
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,400
was our address right exactly I'm

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,400

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,709
a put put put out a a word to

43
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,220
on in Bahrain which unfortunately cannot
be here today on

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,500
due to its even mentioned a variety
reasons the main one being

45
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,489
health-related

46
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,420
but nothing major make me turn up with
it can be here today

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,850
but not so major where things are not in
a result well so

48
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,980
we look forward to seeing yes soon and I
wish them well if you if you see him

49
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,630
online

50
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,670
absolutely and we thank you guys for
letting our bumbling asses come instead

51
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,579
of the rock stars that they would have
been

52
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,739
yup alright so outlets in this is wrong
with this

53
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,220
absolutely that the time on this talk is
actually you know housekeeping

54
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,359
hacking a hotel locks indeed there's a
will there's a lot of lock mechanisms

55
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:30,090
around hotels and all them do really
funky stuff

56
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,810
so our hotel rooms are supposed to be
nice little sanctuary

57
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,549
supposed to be your little place home
away from home this cozy little spot

58
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,069
that you can be comfortable and you can
be yourself the other not always this

59
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:41,530
way

60
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,849
when you travel as much as we do but
sometimes you know in this increasing

61
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:46,330
hotel

62
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,530
this is all we had very few it's like
the Waldorf but do you know

63
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,360
appear in Midtown okay I'm so yeah you
know you want to just curl up

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,810
if you wanna curl up and sleep or not
sleep either way your room should be

65
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,620
your room which shouldn't be with your
friends kick in the door down you don't

66
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,900
want to be this guy

67
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,129
and we're gonna hopefully I'll teach you
how to not be this guy

68
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:10,370
or you know if that's your girlfriend
how to come in on this guy I don't know

69
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,329
so yeah let's just simply let's talk
about hotel room doors and some other

70
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:16,409
really cool hacking

71
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,380
that bar in Hana put together for this
talk which was in the program as you saw

72
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,719
if you were expecting to see their their
awesomeness

73
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:26,419
you're about to bobek so

74
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,810
this is a interesting to look carefully

75
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,760
has been around in the intelligence
community for a while and it was

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,250
discovered and publicize a lil bit
recently by

77
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,320
Bergenheim and its for lack of a better
for on word

78
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,800
the undead or tool it's very aptly named
as you will see

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,770
and we happen to have one right here
that are one or the other more directors

80
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,810
Erica show

81
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,169
was able to weld together very fine
welding sir

82
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:59,659
so this is a video they had actually
prepared

83
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:03,820
and we're just gonna play it for you in
their stead yeah they were at to

84
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,990
it was one that was the essence security
show I think a

85
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,570
was it was i defend it. yes Andrew
Germany so you're saying the lock is

86
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,310
nice it's not just an ice jam proof lock
the deadbolt

87
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,010
right meaning see can't just let the
match so to speak but there are other

88
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,130
ways of getting an

89
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:24,500
without you know had key cards so is
sliding and the tool

90
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,020
and what he's doing is is tilting at up
and is gonna rock it

91
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,380
over the door handle from the inside
which is that safety release right you

92
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,130
have to

93
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,860
and over movies n so

94
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,319
yeah it's its it's pretty simple

95
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:47,460
and here's a video from the inside you
think it's a still frame but no

96
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,710
their dance so there's the to all its
gonna swing upward and it's got a strain

97
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,349
is gonna book

98
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:59,350
around the door handle and we're for is
it would

99
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,860
awesome when like the best attacks in
the simplest ones that anyone can come

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,979
up with don't panic

101
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,199
there's a solution as every geek knows

102
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,520
the most mass least you can have the
tile

103
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,318
thankfully you all know you're jealous
it's in your restroom

104
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,850
sticker on the door handle and I no one
can now use this trick

105
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,250
so however

106
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,139
go

107
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,310
as a result we actually have decided to
make

108
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,680
mister douglas adams is an honorary
remember

109
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,930
post-mortem because he really had a
going on

110
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,180
and his memory yes excellent excellent
who knew Hitchhiker's Guide was also a

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,150
security manual

112
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,310
yeah so let's say you're afraid of this
attack which by the way how many people

113
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,860
followed that whole Masada Hamas
assassination scandal

114
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,340
is a lot of people who believe this was
one of the tools used

115
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,860
in the process and some other trickery
use that we're about to cover here

116
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,560
%ah so tell you what is no easy way
liking this right i mean

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,220
even if you'd like trying to keep cards
there's no access logs for this

118
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,490
a I don't think there's any actually any
hotel

119
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,900
locks that record or audit you know
doors being open from the inside because

120
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,290
that seems like a kind of a silly thing
to longer on it

121
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,440
right right so

122
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,590
it really currently is very difficult to
figure out

123
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,960
if a if room was open easing attack we
haven't had the time to

124
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,030
look everything forensic right we have
it at the time to do it here at all

125
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,289
either right so yes yes

126
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,200
so let's say you're afraid above this
attack and you like I want people to

127
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,810
marginal gonna use these extra you the
extra features that some hotel doors

128
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,260
have

129
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,710
with holders the chains not always what
you see today but there's

130
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,660
plenty of ways of breaking through this
chain no this is not your hot as the sex

131
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,160
talk

132
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,190
this is a these are different its

133
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,169
so first time all summer these chains
you would be amazed at how badly they're

134
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:00,810
installed

135
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,150
and with your common criminal today
being a method being really skinny

136
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,389
like this is really hot this this kid is
not an iPad

137
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:14,389
this is my anything could you queue yet
a shirt from the Midwest is a method

138
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,340
you know and I'll anymore second still
when I resident right

139
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,979
now this is a video the Bari put
together also documenting fun things you

140
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,550
can do with chains again

141
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,770
as long as you can get your hand in the
door at all you can sort a trick around

142
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,779
and play with rubber bands an elastic in
tape in

143
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,419
all kind of thing some people say this
is a method for real locking the chain

144
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,958
they think the assassination now that
the Amazon pulled out my to relock the

145
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,500
chain making it look like a suicide or
natural death

146
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,030
but again if you wanna unlock the chain
the same principle applies

147
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:53,079
try to reach around as best you can
reaching around and robbers together is

148
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,580
not you know it doesn't work well

149
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,839
but as we've said before the frame the
phrase a that's what she said

150
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,700
works all the time with everyone making
them a you every single

151
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,070
yes yes that is exactly right now he
said

152
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,530
thank you many pilots entered my own

153
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:17,530
fruit so yeah I mean the chain is pretty
well and busted the chain is awful if

154
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,560
you still use one

155
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,470
on your house you're probably in a
rent-controlled apartment here in New

156
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,060
York City

157
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,300
because it's really old modern buildings
don't have the modern building so if you

158
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,690
know things like this when you got to
have a guy that looks nice rate I mean

159
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,640
this this hotel has them it absolutely
is the new way is the new way that's

160
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,980
right no it's really not about a chain

161
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,600
you gonna do a budget drugs off the back
up a hooker he might think that like a

162
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,270
hotel security can come in and get me
cuz I've got this

163
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,640
you know borrow my door now every hotel
security man has won a vis in his

164
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,250
arsenal

165
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,140
it's called a slacker tool for lack of a
better term you just get a place and

166
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,530
then

167
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,150
however

168
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,569
yeah it looks like just a really thin
bent piece of metal thats

169
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,000
because it is just a really thin that
piece of metal now let's say you are you

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,390
know you don't have one of those because
he lost one if your security man in the

171
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,900
in the

172
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,530
I know man who's got a slap to we got
evict all these deadbeat guests from

173
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,000
hope

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,910
they're all being used right now i cant
get in the room no the security and

175
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,699
other government for those high dollar
clients for picnic

176
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,850
you can always just take you know the
maid

177
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,360
do not disturb or please make up this
room sign and if you do it a couple

178
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,579
times you'd be surprised at how
effectively discovered

179
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:38,579
yeah

180
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,270
so so that's all that now it's actually
not as easy as you might think

181
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,270
to do some unease attacks here at the
hotel Penn has anyone ever notice the

182
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,650
doors at the hotel Penn

183
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,250
much like myself are really back they're
like the they're they're way bigger than

184
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,050
a debate

185
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,620
have how many people been like what is
up with this yeah

186
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,069
that's actually a really cool piece of
history and I bet most if you don't know

187
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:05,740
these are called stop were servidores
and you don't see them

188
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,449
except in really awesome all buildings
like this that are being torn down

189
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,920
pretty much everywhere hotel pan is
probably the only place I've seen them

190
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,199
in New York anymore

191
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,480
back in the days when it was you know
everyone was business travel whenever

192
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,490
was a spy

193
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,270
you could smoke on airplanes in the room
worsens and you have your shoes polished

194
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,949
and they be left outside your door with
the paper

195
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,980
the valet would clean your suit

196
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,250
if you wanted your suit return to you
without disturbing the guest

197
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,280
the valet could open the outside the
servitor

198
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,470
and hang it in the door that's what the
compartment was for

199
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,010
and then you can open your door and get
it you know after your mistress had left

200
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,900
without you know your life I now know
that shit in the sixties

201
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,900
you watch Mad Men it's the fuckin
top-rated show on cable Jesus Christ

202
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,270
yeah but you know so valid these old
buildings they stink in a creek in the

203
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,760
water scrappy is no power but you know
there's

204
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,300
the crate this is one a little it's nice
thumbs up 0 xn

205
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,440
its quaint the peeling paint is quaint

206
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,650
Pennsylvania six five thousand okay

207
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,920
you do do do do do so

208
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,740
one more thing about you know common
hotel doors most to them have people

209
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,130
have you noticed this again it's how you
know that you it's actually the hooker

210
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,579
coming to your room and not security to
Buster in the lobby

211
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:22,180
obvious the state we know what these
people are up against its all true

212
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,790
so peoples are supposed to be a security
mechanism to protect you you look out

213
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,910
into the hallway

214
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,959
well what are your friends demonstrated
amazingly it not a con

215
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,110
that you can really do a lot of other
things the hotel doors

216
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,250
was anyone around CP like fucking with
your room at not a connoisseur

217
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,150
did you have like laser lights being
shown into your room when you're trying

218
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,790
to sleep with somebody did you have
strings looping around try to grab the

219
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,890
handle

220
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,390
yet out most to these hotel dead but
like my so much these peoples are

221
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,770
installed really badly

222
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,530
you can unscrew them from the outside
constantly I will go to constantly go

223
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,300
different hotels and the first thing I
the first thing I do when I

224
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,339
go in my room is I wonder how you know
elicits people as Muslims in from the

225
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:03,940
outside

226
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,880
just record with your fingers and and
unscrew it yeah because the outside a

227
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,770
nice varnish they're not going to really
do that

228
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,430
like repeatedly not gonna treat the door
the inside the door that painted

229
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,770
they're gonna paint it so much that the
peoples in a kinda Wheldon place on that

230
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,490
side

231
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,470
and you can just you know grab the front
and spin it open so absolutely be

232
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,310
mindful that the people's for a number
of reasons

233
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,740
it's also very hackers to do this kinda
shit with people's if you call your

234
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,709
friends seen over like getting stoned to
the room you like dude

235
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,980
I think the cops were beyond year look
outside if you have a nice printer a

236
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,449
steady hand with some scissors and tape

237
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:44,449
you do this here

238
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,010
that is not our trek alright just came
up when I did an image search for people

239
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,880
and I was too good not to include

240
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,050
so %ah

241
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,840
but you know I stay in your room right
sometimes have to leave the room no

242
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,550
right cuz

243
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,090
you know you can only be entertained so
much in your room I consider myself a

244
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,180
lot my reply

245
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,960
dynasty was not even in town yet moving
on

246
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,200
flight was delayed when he won for me
I'm a man so let's see

247
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,210
let's say to settle your room and of
course

248
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,750
you may take an elevator cuz no the
stairs are

249
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,860
so awesome we are not instantiate and
inside the elevator

250
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,090
there are usually you know some
wonderful buns including a door close

251
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,670
button

252
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,230
now there are a variety of myths about
this button raise your hand

253
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,630
if you had someone tell you that either
they or someone they knew

254
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,630
was able to use it express correct
therefore by holding down the floor

255
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,070
and the door closed one how many other
actually said this works to someone

256
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,820
and ambassador is it okay for those
alright I want a minute lies

257
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,300
on I told somebody this once cuz I was
young and naive

258
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:02,110
its it's a total total for King ly on in
fact and many brands and models

259
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,870
elevators the buttons actually not even
hooked up to anything and

260
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,480
the reason for that is because when you
really think about it though it is kinda

261
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,340
freaky right you're in a tiny

262
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,270
in closed metal thing that is moving up
and down a very narrow shaft

263
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,449
and share I I knew it was gone

264
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,970
anyway so people like to have the
illusion of control

265
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,730
so the door close button in many
elevators doesn't actually do anything

266
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,230
you president-elect argument all there
goes a closed no

267
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,170
it was gonna close anyway it's on a
timer it's really there just for you now

268
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,280
the door open but does actually do
something

269
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,819
but the door closed of the few that myth
to punch someone in the face if they

270
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
keep trying to perpetrate

271
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,990
Smith yeah

272
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,200
and some in sunny in a lot that I've
been hooked up with ninety percent it

273
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,000
does nothing right

274
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,030
right so

275
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,060
there are also some elevators that have
the

276
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,340
isolation offer different forsaken turn
four on offense

277
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,260
as if you were delightful and oftentimes
these are protected by

278
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,560
very high security you know way for
locks the cost of two dollars to

279
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,360
manufacture

280
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,650
how many people have picked way for
locks down a lot think village yeah

281
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,470
real real top shelf security million
right now heights high quality stuff

282
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,740
that we're talking about here

283
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,990
and oftentimes this is used as a
security measure

284
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,890
right i mean oh well no one can get this
for because you have to have a special

285
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,689
key

286
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,740
or special access card in order to
activate the floor

287
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,320
yeah well except for this one that one
was America right

288
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,810
with yeah occasionally occasionally
you'll see a proper Lao

289
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,390
I got to know what's on 47 in that
building yeah because that's that's not

290
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,250
only for like it a lot of times we
actually gonna see if you can see I

291
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,860
skewed locks on an elevator

292
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,180
sometimes it's just part of a consistent
security policy as the example I was the

293
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,720
University a lot of the buildings

294
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,490
had medical soldiers in the elevators
not because they're protecting the

295
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,360
specific but because it was just
security policy to have standardized

296
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,650
cylinders and certain types of equipment

297
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,699
so you know bravo to any facilities that
do that

298
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,440
speaking more bad locks in elevators a
lot of times you'll see really bad locks

299
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,730
on little access panels and elevators
have anyone ever notice these

300
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,449
will tubular locks very popular sometime
also very I security

301
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,050
yes who's your pick to Turlock with the
with the proper tools a pic material on

302
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,290
a ballpoint pen

303
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,959
yeah so you'll find these

304
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,450
and not you know sometimes you get an
elevator in like its open who crew left

305
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,640
this open certainly

306
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,050
we found it this way and you know we did

307
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,510
you know know it so stop laughing it off
as a joke we found that this year really

308
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,950
for things yes but inside their desk
fascinating stuff

309
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,980
not just turn on and off the fan because
you're all sweaty and hot internal likes

310
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
of military medical

311
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,820
gonna rape party yeah now you can do
things like

312
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,100
what's called independent service mode
independent service mode if you turn

313
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,750
that on

314
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,820
the elevator ignores all calls from
other floors it doesn't go to its recall

315
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,270
floor

316
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,470
it does exactly what you say for any
purpose at any time

317
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,700
yeah if there aren't floor you're not
supposed to get to

318
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,480
independent service mode you can do with
it would you say your fandom independent

319
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,020
service

320
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,900
I am a fan of people who are not
affiliated agencies that is correct

321
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,820
okay they're pretending not to laugh
okay

322
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,270
all right now this is this is not a lock

323
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,280
in an elevator however UCIS know it no
Islami got

324
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,379
the other thing it's not this is not

325
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,170
independent service mode INS is a
popular breed the Asian

326
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,230
in an elevator for certain types of
functions independent service is

327
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,880
abbreviated

328
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,190
inde INS usually most ill manors means
inspection service mode

329
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,230
sounds similar it's not very very
different

330
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,700
your that's when it drops the elevator
halfway between floors and stays put

331
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,970
with its doors open seating on a roof

332
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,100
arm yet don't they have not something
you wanna find out by accident

333
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,740
yeah like our red team this company
gonna be and we're gonna be out we get

334
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,090
the bank records got no

335
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,830
no sir taking the stairs on our job

336
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,620
your audit job will take a turn for the
worse absolutely

337
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,480
0103 time in elevators cuz you know
somebody cylinders

338
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,000
when you turn a lot of them just
snapback when they're picked

339
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,480
some get locked opened and I have to
pick up close and that way for a lock

340
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,750
that was so easy to pick first the
second ago

341
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:39,930
it I know I'm not a movie like I

342
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,590
at and you know you're being you know as
an auto rearview being paid to do this

343
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,439
so

344
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,400
you they're paying big bucks because
you're supposed to look slick doing it

345
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,650
and

346
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,540
this does not look slick when you know
you get stuck any photos you see the

347
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:51,920
request

348
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,740
it's not us with to let us with our
company the core group taking these

349
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,630
photos online

350
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,760
jobs at night the fire service mode

351
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,830
where it will get their asses jump in
ahead of the game yup

352
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,429
when they bring in cookies for the girls
birthday you don't get one set down

353
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,500
instead wait to get those q2 smart you
should be an AP program

354
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,420
know where to get that a promise

355
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,800
wow thats awful and scary and don't tell
anyone where you live

356
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,260
I so I love this particular panel that I
saw wants

357
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,940
because we just told you about the whole
independent you know inspection

358
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,110
regular this is like the power just pops
open with the emergency phone

359
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:38,110
hey although thank you for your best

360
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,450
yes fuller they I'm so yeah so inside
the regular panel

361
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,020
there's a lockable panel that lockable
panel has other type a quick minute

362
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,170
switches and the like as a whole see if
awesome goodness again you know turn off

363
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,920
the fan turn off the lights

364
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,740
independent mode is in there inspection
mode is in there

365
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,340
do you notice however that well I guess
at a circuit breakers

366
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,419
the labels are in between each switch

367
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,940
and if you know you're not really
closely paying attention I my first look

368
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,670
at this photos like damn I don't know
which which is actually which

369
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,580
I swear I think someone probably fucked
up and drop the elevator stuck in

370
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,928
between floors because someone went
around the dime a label are clarified

371
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:25,600
which switches which

372
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,280
you see that was circuit breakers to
sometimes you have you have it on this

373
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,110
and the breaker itself but then yells at
the key next to it is a good career you

374
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,990
never know what you're gonna come across

375
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,910
so now for the gentleman in anyone's
been curious so you gonna tell a little

376
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,120
bit about how fire mod can go

377
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,410
yet so fire service mode

378
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,890
the in this is actually almost the whole
talk unto itself we're going to do an

379
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,150
elevator hacking talk

380
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,270
one day we only had like 17 hours to put
a replacement talk together so we did

381
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,920
this

382
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,270
and borrowed from some of our other
material but a

383
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,820
farm owners interesting and that

384
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,970
its it's like independent service but
quite

385
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,160
yeah it'll actually override other
security protocols sometimes at a really

386
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,390
high tech you know I secure building

387
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,200
independent mode still not respond to
certain floors if there's a lot of

388
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,080
walkouts engaged

389
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,810
if fire mode is enabled again that's a
you know risk of life

390
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,340
safety of life issue fire mod can do a
lot of things that you're not supposed

391
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,740
to be able to do including group
basements

392
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,410
ignoring car readers now it is not true

393
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,990
maybe you can just engage fire mod from
the cab this key

394
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,640
in the elevator cab will not turn on
fire mod in the cab

395
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,290
that's called fire mod to way but down
the lobby

396
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,389
you can so everyone has probably seen
and the lobby ever

397
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,620
most facilities a nother

398
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,210
way from lock in the lobby that says
fire

399
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,990
you know it's couple fireman logo honors
fight fire here just fire on it

400
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,730
and that is kinda made master control

401
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,850
that much the whole system in the fire
service mode one

402
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,130
so when firefighters have to enter the
building for whatever reason

403
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,500
and they answered their keen flip it to
on it will recall

404
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,060
all the elevator cars all a cab down to
their home floor as which is usually

405
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,010
lobby

406
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,290
and have them open now all the elevators
are on their home floor

407
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,320
with all the doors open and now the
firemen enters the cabin

408
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,970
takes a different hearing because this
key usually has to stay

409
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,970
in the original some wonder takes a
different key ring

410
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,970
engages the other I'll locks on your end
for fire mod

411
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,290
and now there are no two and now they
can go to any floor overriding any

412
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,620
security protocols

413
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,290
its what about the letter what happens

414
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,050
nothing right yeah

415
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:50,500
usually it's not unless its program ROM
I found elevators were havin gauge fire

416
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,720
mod two for no reason whatsoever

417
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,630
%ah that was never supposed to happen
but yeah so if you're really interested

418
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,929
in elevator hacking talk to us some more

419
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:03,690
who shall be over there you're drunk
tuna what you need to know

420
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,010
yes I know sir it's my force my or
adjust commands

421
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,750
know it really is just simple cheap keys
keys that are standardized across

422
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,919
a lot of manufacturers keys that you
know

423
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,130
we we have Ashley com

424
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,100
if you try to buy them through
legitimate channels you'll be told no if

425
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,260
you try to buy them a fake

426
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,960
Fire Department letterhead you can but
they cost like 250 dollars

427
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,470
they don't cost that much if you talk to
us later if you actually are proper pen

428
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,790
tester and we speak to you I mean if
this is really a career

429
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,899
talk to us about it maybe will enable
set you up known as caring as you

430
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,690
imagine

431
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,280
ans only as as you know universal
because

432
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,570
when they ship the elevators you know by
UPS

433
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,620
on they have to come the locks already
installed so this is generally the Sonos

434
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,179
installed for this key ring

435
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,390
has much different car keys for
different makes and models and such

436
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,550
and as long as a facility has been
swapped out the cylinder

437
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,480
then one of these keys will very likely
work this is actually a

438
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,000
a mini version of the risk is that is
like a master boers never call crack

439
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,760
that has

440
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,310
about three times as many keys for you
know that one elevator in the hostel in

441
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,158
Europe

442
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,320
that you know you're gonna be auditing
yeah

443
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,960
but any any facility should have a small
panel somewhere

444
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
in the building that has the master
elevator key usually the service pump

445
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,220
like that pneumatic pump rumor elevator
electric room key

446
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,770
usually is panels controlled by a
medical lock that lucky standardize

447
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,030
there's one for every state

448
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,820
you can get a ring a fifty medic Okies
which I've never been able to get

449
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,030
so much I tried and that will just
completely you know

450
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,908
pones or the universe

451
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:44,120
so fire service keys not only open
interesting panels you know in the

452
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,630
elevator an axe which is in the elevator

453
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,940
occasionally make make it interesting
place because you did

454
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,030
this is there never remember tells lies
ago we talked about how

455
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,440
you know it kinda overrides the default
security protocols and takes it a force

456
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,900
that most people should be in

457
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,320
so sometimes also the strange things

458
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
on not now normally there is

459
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,428
you know hatch on top at the Cannes I'll

460
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:12,720
for maintenance purposes and they're
actually is usually locked from the

461
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,470
outside

462
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,990
yeah it's not like in the movies we like
oh the elevator stopped I'm gonna climb

463
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,300
the top right now know if you actually
stuck in elevator chances are there's

464
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,409
years you're stuck in the elevator so
the video that guy who was stuck in an

465
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:27,950
elevator for like two weeks are you know
if it was the only days is

466
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,000
pretty serious your okay

467
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,060
else on the guy yes much I know I think
you'd like the rest

468
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,470
yeah so this one actually had a lock and

469
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,870
and on the bottom for some reason and
I'll let's get to the

470
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,740
top at the Cannes and on a you can also

471
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,409
you know go to certain maintenance
elevators and I'll take it interesting

472
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:49,700
places nope

473
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,200
you really don't wanna be messing around
in here and there's a lot of equipment

474
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,990
that does things that no one is not
familiar with you can easily get hurt

475
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,010
and such

476
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,169
but you know our you also this is
something that you want protected

477
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,570
because you know it to be a liability
don't want people

478
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,899
you know screwing around in here
potentially creating issues

479
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,810
ago so yeah like that this equipment
it's dangerous dodgy stuff

480
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,970
you don't want to be around it you don't
wanna be in the freemen video if you're

481
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,530
subcontractor on a red team job who
wasn't you know officially hired by the

482
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,710
company

483
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,740
it's actually legally 1099 and
everything was fine

484
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,810
but yeah

485
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:33,389
so are my lovely photoshop work see can
see who actually works for us

486
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,520
but keep telling the story when you were
in the maintenance area or no

487
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,790
are like a guy was in a maintenance area

488
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,710
somewhere I don't know and there was
found

489
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,020
a a set of keys

490
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,320
thats EQ

491
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,780
you could enter by those who see this
show 11 times in 10

492
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,010
its delicious ok anyway what anyways so

493
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,190
there was fun to set up a home for the
phases with something from yep that the

494
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,050
started you know mmm just tried a
different Saunders

495
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,490
and eventually you know but it by the
way behind a

496
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,750
in the in the background the for you see
the a axis control

497
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,850
panel and mechanism for for the owners
actually pretty modern system

498
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,679
very much hanging in there panel yeah
the keys were in the end it's areas if

499
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,820
you do ready with ARC

500
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,010
a fucking keys like you know once you're
in that door with a stand-in so what do

501
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,600
you do about his key is right if your
maintenance I mean gotta put them

502
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,429
somewhere

503
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:34,360
and one would think you get like a key
can to organize the keys

504
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,990
or have some sort of a master key to
them right right

505
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,280
but now they had a different system this
stuff the mall in a drawer

506
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,830
and locked the desk drawer with lewinsky
right and as if the test or for the keys

507
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,330
was a disorganized or not they decided
to add a little bit organization at

508
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:51,780
their own

509
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,370
there's actually outwards 10 on the far
right that's labeled

510
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,890
he's for

511
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,190
I so what are these keys lead further
I'll good

512
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,020
I was looking for all these other keys
skirts a tremendous

513
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,350
skis so where was that other door

514
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,909
yeah sonnet photos

515
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,260
that yeah that eventually leads to you
know also

516
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,030
more places

517
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,158
the forest up top security I'll

518
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,600
the people who know that is left the
people who don't don't wanna know

519
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,040
now set in and some facilities %uh

520
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,340
you know sometimes you right there'd
down on on their financials need to get

521
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,900
some extra income

522
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,480
so day may have results parts thereof
facility to

523
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,960
a third party like you know say at cell
phone company

524
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,050
and they have to put that our common
somewhere and

525
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,399
you know someone her lotta noise behind
on our room with the grill on the door

526
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,370
which is kinda been on thing and

527
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,000
he kinda put the camera up to the grill
and you can start seeing some the

528
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,350
equipment or acts like how it looks
interesting

529
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,570
I want to try and those keys right and
and so you go to traffic

530
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,210
try the keys and it appears that someone
probably can't find the keys in the

531
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,220
drawer

532
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,370
and they decided you know next time I'm
just gonna kinda

533
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:25,400
put tape on the door latch which is the
state that we found the store and

534
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,370
and now you are in a telco a room with a
lot of equipment that

535
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,010
you should not be near but

536
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,490
with the you know were closer people had
been there and everything

537
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:44,490
you can I journal spear absolutely no

538
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,860
they'll never know

539
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,010
so let's get back to the room yeah I
know we've gone around the corner you

540
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,840
no not them you can do this someone is
gone around the hotel enough let's

541
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,210
you can only you know when your pen
testing you always carry the ice bucket

542
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,880
because you know depending on where you
are if you like old this isn't the ice

543
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,640
machine

544
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,320
that only take you so far that homework
when we looking fresher towels and stuff

545
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,600
yeah it may not work with any other
e-mail Korea the photographer hotel

546
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,169
work this is in woodshop class

547
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:28,700
sorry back back back to your room take
the elevator back down

548
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,960
got some love you may notice a lot of
elevators in swanky hotels

549
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,200
you know kinda like this one although
this one to have these in this hotel the

550
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,520
disc in other news 'em

551
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,100
some hotels will have key card readers
but only let you to certain floors

552
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,950
come even in a hotel like that exactly I
don't have stuck with someone like an

553
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,330
end parties in 4915

554
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,550
and you like fuck did no one told us
that fourteen I don't have a key that

555
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,330
gets me there

556
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,790
well sometimes it's just a little over
I'd like that yes just

557
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,260
slipping anything in there sometimes
it's a mechanical reed switch

558
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,720
don't discount that right it might get
you you know

559
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,179
but a lot of times it is a proper card
reader you can bypass those in a number

560
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,480
of ways we're about to talk about

561
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,540
for instance you know the switches don't
forget the switch is there is one that

562
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,030
just you know

563
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:21,690
turns it off

564
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,070
this is almost a hollywood level I love

565
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,869
you know in security right cuz there's
always override no matter how many bits

566
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,800
of encryption there are

567
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,619
and and the in the national security
system there's always an override

568
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,290
usually just type in a bright for recall
correctly a crash crash over

569
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,889
but here you can

570
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:45,020
you can I meet you can just turn it on

571
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,560
what card reader yes so yeah there's
that

572
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,040
there's there's other ways to mess with
the card reader to really come back to

573
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,668
this we talking to max trade cards in a
little bit

574
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:57,330
also know if you noticed this is some
this is from a black at the Caesars

575
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,460
can you do a little math on this
elevator here this elevators estimating

576
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,690
that the average person

577
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,100
in Las Vegas and a nice like casino
weighs 150 pounds

578
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:13,450
I don't think so be seen the people at
the slot machines no food no no no

579
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,830
like a car warranty whichever you hit
first that many people

580
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,080
or that many balance speaking in the
elevator maximum weights

581
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,850
the elevator the ex the Express one that
goes from meds to

582
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,510
18 hedge but next time you're in there
just look at the maximum weight limit

583
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:28,879
and

584
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:32,300
and look at the people around you that
and decide it italian-american actually

585
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,980
handle that

586
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,360
because I am pretty sure can't

587
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,310
yet yeah I can handle going down that's
correct spare

588
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:47,149
gonna get here that fast take a
stopwatch

589
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:50,260
so right back but now back in the floors
were gonna talk about a room keys

590
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,408
towards the end what we got like 20
minutes left maybe 25

591
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,980
leaf not questions yet we're doing
pretty good for a talk we threw together

592
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:03,980
without sleeping in 17 hours this is
working at he's liking it so far

593
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:09,580
it's all for you with a letter for you

594
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,969
see you don't see these as much water
Kal Penn matrix cards and whenever

595
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,780
see when you get to the European events
yes your night very happy to see their

596
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,070
world travelers they're not normal
American deviant was adamant that the

597
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,399
zone exist anywhere in the US anymore
but I told him that I actually stayed in

598
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,029
a hotel that still use these

599
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,340
and the further so my point who is set
in a hotel in the US that uses one of

600
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,480
these

601
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,730
I a kind of a Down I because I'm

602
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:38,668
you know I'm sayin swanky places was on
a barrister bring a lady back to

603
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:42,138
because these guys came out in the very
very early eighties their popular in the

604
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,710
eighties and through the nineties and
had mostly been phased out in the US

605
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,389
they're still really popular parts of
Europe because that's where they

606
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,110
originated

607
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,730
retrieving company or think our division
at the tree having company which is a a

608
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,659
Scandinavian

609
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,110
Nate askin even country makes this and
it's a really

610
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,510
really neat design just from my serve a
lockpicking mechanical picking

611
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,760
perspective the the design involves

612
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,700
pins tacks like you've seen in a lot of
blocks a lot a pin tumbler locks

613
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,650
the whole thing the whole affair has but
I would call a drawer

614
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,310
and this drawer has to slide out

615
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,779
to engage you know there's a tail piece
that has to engage the proper hand or as

616
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,630
the hell does nothing

617
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,360
but if you notice I didn't just sorta
you know scam because I made this

618
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,820
animation at 5am

619
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,369
a couple days ago I actually you know
I'm representing us properly it's

620
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:34,220
actually the same size pins

621
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,369
in every chambers the same driver been
the same keep an

622
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,960
a ball bearing on top of that because
the pins when they are at rest

623
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,210
require the insertion up one sickness

624
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,890
above in a room key card in order to be
set at the proper position

625
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,810
so how does this work as many of you
know most hotels have moved away from

626
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,020
the old fashion metal

627
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,160
keys in this week or two get them how
many people travel in Italy and other

628
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,600
but we actually get a medal room key
it's nice isn't it

629
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,640
but if you lose the key if they need to
make more keys they need to recombinant

630
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,910
the locks there's really no effective
way to do that

631
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,149
so hotels near the way up quickly and
economically

632
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,970
changing locks out without you know
taking the door part that swerving car

633
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,630
became one of the first systems to do
this

634
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,350
the way the system works is a control
card

635
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,440
is inserted in the back up the walk so
inside the room you can usually pop the

636
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,770
panel open with a hex not our special
little security hex not

637
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,720
and you insert back at the lock

638
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,910
so here we have a control card being
installed

639
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,080
click click click my animated gif skill
serves me well if anyone doesn't really

640
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,830
fully appreciate how awesome some these
animations are

641
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:48,390
TV in animates these frame by frame I
have no didn't give him a lack of

642
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,819
a crash flaca way increase speed in
which people

643
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,869
in a always animations were done in one
night just

644
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:00,810
go on yeah thank you sir it's fun I like
I like

645
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,049
I like the looks on their faces when you
when you just get it you know I

646
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,020
it's sometimes hard to talk about this
stuff but we like to make it simple

647
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,180
that's our job that's what we're tool

648
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,609
at or about see how this lot you have
this control card in the lock

649
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,810
now notice sum up in stacks are at the
proper position now

650
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,750
so these two pins tacks are the proper
position

651
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,480
and the card itself can can wiggle the
court has to be a

652
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,190
because in order to put a key card in
the front of the lock

653
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,610
the ball bearings need to be able to
move including ball bearings that are

654
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,440
now blocked because they're sitting atop

655
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,680
the control cars that make sense so
imagine

656
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,810
a pass card the room key that you're
actually issued

657
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,040
that slides in completes the rest

658
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,619
I love the the the lot the bearings that
need to be pushed down the stacks

659
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:52,350
now the drawer can slide back because
every stack

660
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,339
has exactly 1 thickness of card added
into the situation

661
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,220
whether it was the control card making
the thickness or the pass card

662
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,710
that'll work if you've never tried
parity you know it's like that has

663
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,369
parity

664
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,950
yeah it's pretty neat if you've ever
tried Avion card

665
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,820
likely in a staggered home late at night
you not sure that everything was the

666
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,270
same in this hotel in Oslo it so stoic
and very very

667
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,310
Scandinavian and you're sticking around
or it almost seems like your card will

668
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,890
go in all the way

669
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,950
what's actually happening is your card
will go when all the way you can't

670
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,780
engage the drawer the drawer won't slide
back that extra little bit

671
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,510
that's what you're bumping up against so
that's how these work it's a really neat

672
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,420
notion

673
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,960
now it's not just a simple array on the
side like that

674
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,640
a course if you pull that out you put a
new pass cardin now the old room key

675
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,960
won't work

676
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,240
but the next room key that was issued
paired with this card

677
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,180
will work bang it works hoop make sense

678
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,618
now it looks simplistic what's actually
going on it is the pen matrix is huge

679
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:56,770
it's even bigger than I could fit in
this you know artwork here

680
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,950
it's a whole array of pins altogether

681
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,550
may actually go up one more row so there
are 32 pins

682
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,900
laid out together here now the control
card

683
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,050
that slips in and interacts with these

684
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,660
has two engage these two what you see
still in red

685
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,859
those two key pins do not have ball
bearings

686
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:20,230
those are called control pens and we'll
get into that the second when I mean by

687
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,740
that

688
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,960
so see these big fat control pins they
don't even have a up

689
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,140
a pin chamber appear imagine if you will

690
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,589
a room that's been cleaned by made it's
been vacated and they have no control

691
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,170
card at all

692
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,490
with no control card at all someone is
that saying how many minutes

693
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:41,510
fifty oh we're good yet we're sweet I
can't believe this is working so well

694
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,460
so with no control card at all knock on
wood you can just look like a credit

695
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,200
card

696
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,740
and then that's the right sickness
everywhere film it would work

697
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,950
so to prevent that these control pins
have to be

698
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:58,390
acted upon by a control card so you at
least have to press them down

699
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,960
so this would like never wear this
control car doesn't for small be stupid

700
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,660
to have this many

701
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,080
controlled it difficult cuts but at
least you have to trip

702
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,540
the control pins on the sides so this at
a minimum

703
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,660
would be a control card again it would
be stupid because now

704
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,259
every Penn stack is waiting to be
pressed down

705
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,660
theirs and you know they're just they're
all waiting for position the bearings

706
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,759
are free to move

707
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,430
this would be a room key or credit card
like that would not work so course they

708
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:24,680
don't

709
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,580
issue that you know both opens the door
similarly

710
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,590
this would work as a control card
because it would push down the Control

711
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,720
pins and every other Penn

712
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,930
now all you need to do is stick
something in there that doesn't mess

713
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,410
with any ball bearing

714
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,170
because if you push any ball bearing a
push the whole affair down to fuck it up

715
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,470
so you know if this were your room this
would be here your room key

716
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,030
so that equally and you understand how
works but that wouldn't make any sense

717
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,770
issue somebody that what actually works

718
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:57,220
in practice is a car kinda like this a
control card will have some of the holes

719
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,000
cut

720
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,800
other holes you know these are not cut
so these pins tacks have been pushed

721
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,320
into position they are fine

722
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,619
don't mess with them any further don't
touch them any further

723
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,369
all the ball other you know those pens
are in position because they're blocked

724
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:15,330
all the ball bearings now the ball
bearing should be pushed down

725
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,910
except for the ones that have arrows
because remember those are already in

726
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,040
position

727
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,020
so that's where you don't want cuts I'm
so that's what you do want

728
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,960
cuts in the key so the key is actually
perfectly complementary to the control

729
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,760
card

730
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,350
it's a really elegantly simple system
when you think about it

731
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:38,270
take out those to control pins and you
have thirty effective pins in the matrix

732
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,570
even though they can only be higher low
that's enough defers to have won a

733
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,290
billion companies to the thirtieth it's
over million right

734
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,680
yeah it's really really need system
it'll work

735
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,080
for most things although we keep a lot
with I'd love to find more these guys I

736
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,259
think we could find ways to attack them

737
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,560
if anyone just occurred put it out there
for anyone who runs into some place it

738
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,279
is getting rid of these hotels be
decommissioned whatever

739
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,140
send us an email because we really would
like to have a couple these to look at

740
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,080
further

741
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,779
spinning out there absolute

742
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,980
loaded questions at the end better than
so my first thought when I first saw how

743
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,050
the system worked

744
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,500
I was like oh shit like if the maid is
cleaning the room in the doors open

745
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,869
did you like slip a solid control card
america's then everything's imposition

746
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:24,050
everything works

747
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,910
but of course that's wrong because
anything that touches the ball bearings

748
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,420
that point will then screw it up in a
won't work

749
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,609
but the idea of attacking through the
control card could work if you had like

750
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:35,470
a dimpled control card

751
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,080
so would set everything up the right
position the ball bearings which would

752
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,210
not be in the way

753
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:44,080
and now any room key technically would
work you would you would like click

754
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,440
but I'm betting if you had like Selina
let's come back to this guy's room later

755
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,460
when you know

756
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,890
whoever fuckin norwegian name ladies in
their cleaning the bathroom I'll ever

757
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,140
get a boom

758
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,170
you know grows in a clean the bathroom
and who didn't have con-

759
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,460
Hogan what's hooker who meet you in Oslo
with me government

760
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,050
I'm going to end up I so you could make
this just by dimpling a regular control

761
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,010
card

762
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,020
if you had access to like a milling
machine CNC milling machine you could

763
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,869
probably make control card that's just

764
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:13,650
like like a cookie tray if you will a
depression again the ball bearings hang

765
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,369
low

766
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:17,369
everything would worry be like the the
the door that everything

767
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:20,700
opens so the person whose room key
really belongs in it that still works

768
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,500
for them

769
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,430
but you could come in later and you know
poems or their wares or whatever it is

770
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,210
you kids today do

771
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:31,950
nope ask our day works ask our viewers
everything works everybody happy

772
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,750
we however thought that there might be
ways a decoding and picking

773
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,670
because of the different pressures that
can happen because the control card in

774
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,000
the pen matrix

775
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,090
a pin stacked that's totally free
floating only has the pressure have one

776
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:45,770
spring

777
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,490
underneath it a pin stack that is
supported by a control card

778
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,550
so technically a ball bearing is
supported by multiple

779
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,780
springs in the stack that would have a
lot more pressure when almost bind up

780
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,960
against you

781
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,450
so the idea either putting carbon paper
in there with a piece of paper and

782
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,300
scraping a credit card in out sure make
an impression

783
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,130
Baba kinda really called really really
lead Oostende I can flick

784
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,820
a sensitive spring card thing that I had
no time to animate at like 6:30 in the

785
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,060
morning

786
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,640
but yet so did if you have his back or
if you wanna visit us at another maybe

787
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,660
European con when we're gonna try to do
more about this

788
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,480
we want to explore this further I think
there's a lot more potential there

789
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,590
even just the idea you know he said
raking like right if you could push in

790
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,410
the drawer

791
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:33,390
and just scrape something in and out
unless these pins are security pins

792
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,500
you could probably rake them into
position with a couple passes

793
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,540
YouTube about to make a custom tensioner
tension the drawer

794
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,190
but yeah you could probably you could
probably easily rake block him

795
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,720
impression is gonna be a lot easier on
the yeah

796
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,920
so yeah we're gonna play with this some
more again if you have any let us know

797
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,250
we

798
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,060
really wanna mess with these but of
course you know you might also realize

799
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,200
there's no easy way to master key a
system like this

800
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,530
most cities being card systems
especially the old pin matrix they do

801
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,230
have a master key just override for the
maid and everyone else

802
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,130
you can see them on the lock usually
sometimes they're hidden by a logo or

803
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,880
something they're still there

804
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,220
sometimes they're installed really badly
they're not even screenwriting just

805
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,250
gonna screw them out and we found that
out

806
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,510
so you take block apart you wind up
being able to get the pin cuts to make

807
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,390
you mad money like the people

808
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,960
with no tools yeah that was bare fingers
doing this

809
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,340
but not I asked though it wouldn't do
this no there was no

810
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,470
it was somebody I don't overdo this is
on the inner tubes I saw it it's real on

811
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,310
the Internet

812
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,830
so Leslie though another place your CDs
override keys

813
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:41,440
are not pin major clocks they are mad
card locks

814
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,460
max try Bloxham largely replaced pin
matrix

815
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,170
VIN card makes them a lot of companies
make them you guys have all seen the ski

816
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,320
you know it's it's a mag stripe card

817
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,430
now the tracks are usually non-standard
it's not something that will always read

818
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,819
perfectly in a basic reader you getting
expensive reader

819
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,740
that'll do raw dump data that'll just
show you whatever is on the card doesn't

820
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,510
worry about timing spacing tragedy one

821
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,849
usually it's hard work yeah exact if
they break standard

822
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,720
yeah if the really cheap stuff right
that they can't do all the decoding and

823
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,400
harbors the wisdom the raw data to
software and the dude in software

824
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,160
and you want your %ah you know TNT this
kinda stuff and then there's the really

825
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,118
expensive stuff

826
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,390
underdog decoding and thank you

827
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,859
it does all the cutting hardware but as
an extra feature

828
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:30,180
then though you know and a little rodham
option

829
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,540
the ideal extreme might be your source
if you wanna fuck max red carpet smile

830
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,710
fades

831
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:39,109
crying a that children will help you
poems or the world

832
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:43,270
so yeah out what's going on with Matt
cards really quickly

833
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,869
we have to be at given really big thanks
to major malfunction as anyone ever seen

834
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:51,240
maxed right madness are old-school
hacking a couple hands

835
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,849
major malfunctions talks about this were
an inspiration for us to look into this

836
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:55,859
further

837
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,869
every room key we've ever inspected is
like this

838
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:03,660
the formatting is very similar you'll
have some kind of start Sentinel

839
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:08,160
many people don't know this it's really
a most mag stripe systems work

840
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,390
the card will clock itself so each like

841
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:16,540
bit that it tix the timing establishes
what it expects for the next timing

842
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,650
so he could be you know really really
fast and I could be really slow and long

843
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,390
and drawn-out

844
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:27,089
nobody that's what she said there you go
there was a plush though yeah I'd set

845
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,830
that one up eight so easy pitch to hit

846
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,340
but no you but the clock will expect
it'll expect the bits intensity that

847
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,290
emotion

848
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,400
is is what what makes a weird if you
change the speed above this white

849
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,890
then it's its that's going to give in
air so the site that has been issued

850
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,920
this system will have its own code

851
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,480
every hotel you know gets their own but
you know that it's all just in the clear

852
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,910
you have a room number

853
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,220
you have a key number you have what's
called a magic number will get into that

854
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,750
and then when it expires in some check
some in ending date at the end

855
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,619
so if you go downstairs to the Destiny
say hey you know my wife checked in now

856
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,310
she her flight finally arrived

857
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,630
can we have another key to our room and
the like okay see you have your key

858
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,840
your key will still work sir okay here's
the next key

859
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,490
what they'll give you is usually this
it's the same key just increments the

860
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,710
number

861
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:17,050
the locks are usually passive locks they
just expect

862
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,940
what they've been trained to expect
we'll we'll tell you what that means in

863
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,340
a second

864
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,890
how many people however have ever been
given a new feel like I need a second

865
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:25,350
key

866
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,020
and then all the old keys fuckin don't
work anymore how's that happen to you

867
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,620
yes

868
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,549
are you try to try to be sneaky like oh
I only have double occupancy but I want

869
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,990
more people fell just say that I for got
lost my keys and would be more keys

870
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:39,670
mmm non doesn't work what they actually
do in that instance

871
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,130
they will issue a brand new you know
your ski number one

872
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,070
but they'll change the magic number now
the algorithm for

873
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:50,560
incrementing the magic number can be
really simple like

874
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,020
walking a bit or can be really
complicated

875
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:59,310
but all the locking the door knows is
hey this is a new magic number

876
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,580
I have to respect this number knockout

877
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:06,130
every key that I saw before and as long
as the check some

878
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:11,990
works the key is valid so the lock will
usually stored the last what's a hundred

879
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,190
magic numbers

880
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,720
you can brute force these you can just
keep trying magic numbers

881
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,030
it'll disable the old keys and all of a
sudden the door opens

882
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,410
it's really really easy to do if you
have one of those raw alright

883
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,450
rocking a robbery draw great racked up
track straight readers mates really

884
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:28,890
really fabulous

885
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,190
and you know most systems a as he said
the passive they're actually not

886
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,660
centrally wired

887
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,759
there's no big computer the tie into at
the front desk where they gonna kill all

888
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,930
the old cars it's just this

889
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:45,080
although the company on occasion there
are you know since that are wired and

890
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,730
there's a

891
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,990
wire running through the door jam you
can see it when the doors open

892
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:53,040
right and yeah if you try and this over
and over

893
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,900
every now and then you like I let's try
to reprogram his car to 10 what is due

894
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,570
in any comeback even a slice of pizza
beer reprogram the card with see what it

895
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:00,260
do in

896
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,530
and have had enough times do in that you
open your door to try it again

897
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,910
and as major malfunction tells a story
set go hello

898
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,310
hello sir mister security sir how you
doing

899
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,860
I DS did they send you up because we're
having trouble with his room piano

900
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,440
what's been going on

901
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,540
I'm gonna go downstairs in a sort that
out

902
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,020
so yes sometimes it will set off an
audit event but usually no usually is

903
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,540
all

904
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:27,279
passive and I it's really really easy to
do this now there are

905
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,580
other special modes that we don't have
time and we don't to

906
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:34,210
will trust these nefarious people to
talk about a lot there are other mods

907
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:38,290
that have to do with changing the magic
number changing the room number two

908
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:41,960
either no or two nines we have some
police buddies

909
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,800
who hotels in the area will issue them a
key it'll get them

910
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,900
to the elevators and get them around
outer doors

911
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,710
for like let's say a whole month if
there's a disturbance here use this key

912
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,170
blanking out the room number or doing
funny things to the room number

913
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,950
will sometimes give you access so if you
wanna be a delivery man

914
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,990
food delivery service in your car this
hotel doesn't allow outside food

915
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:07,790
sometimes a key like this will let you
get up and down the elevators just fine

916
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,290
getting the outside doors just fine if
you want to deliver you know the

917
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,330
compound chicken

918
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,580
or if you want wanna run like really
high class wars that knock on the door

919
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,790
and they don't have to call the
concierge is really embarrassing alike

920
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,170
mister my show your guests have arrived

921
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:25,510
they know they'll know in the lobby
what's going on

922
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:30,000
no so you know you make a key like this
there are also special modes

923
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,770
that I will lead to turn it on me again
yes

924
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,860
there are also special modes obviously
that security has it made to have

925
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,830
the left the door open but will not
knock out previous keys from working

926
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,490
that has to do with playing with the
magic number in the room number as well

927
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,690
we're not going to get into that here

928
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,350
really interesting or so not gonna get
it too is crime scene mode

929
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:54,710
which major malfunction insists will
totally das the door

930
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,650
like if there's evidence that has to be
preserved they don't want some may come

931
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,400
in and vacuuming up the blood before the
CSI team gets there

932
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,400
it'll just Polak and no one can get in
at all

933
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,500
ever for any purpose but if you wanna
know more about that please out tell

934

936
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:16,250
