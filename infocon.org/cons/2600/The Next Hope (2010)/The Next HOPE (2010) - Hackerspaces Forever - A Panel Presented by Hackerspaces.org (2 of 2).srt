1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,089
you help me do that and the this done by
you know this timer

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,950
a and allow the times I a set date

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,310
isn't a good way to do it but maybe a an
event that's coming up

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,000
so we have an open house in a couple
weeks we get this project done by them

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,170
you know what you need me to help you
with what

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,340
what typeof you know resources you need
you need you know someone else

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,030
but whatever it is just you can need
somebody to take charge in

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,130
and ask those questions but I think
we're talking about this earlier on Mike

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,320
overall driving force at the hackerspace

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,790
is it for us and for the ones are
involved with any way said

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,200
it's like something fun you know if we
wanna have so

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,790
on if doesn't matter how good an idea is
if it's not good enough

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,129
that that somebody in there wants to
serve be the driving force on it like

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,140
if you're if you like assigning people
to do things

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,710
like that's not necessarily fine you
know and what you call them

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,180
ingest yeah you come up with a cool name
for them

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,709
that's okay hey we recently when I
remembered that taken on the role in the

18
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,929
sign and Jess its news we started
calling him to find it in and out like

19
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:11,469
offers a cool things are showing up in
amman I am not kidding it's the greatest

20
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,149
thing ever

21
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:16,909
it's out yeah calm people into and and

22
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,490
I i've said this earlier but know it
Noisebridge

23
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,509
it's anarchy and it really works for us
so if

24
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,590
someone's really passionate about
something and they want to do it they

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,929
just go ahead and start

26
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,560
they can get other people involved by
talking on the email list IRC

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,979
in person um recruiting anywhere they
can if other people are interested

28
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:40,619
it takes off by car near a your space
balloons there's two groups at

29
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,499
Noisebridge

30
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:45,509
that started just because one person
said well look at this this is really

31
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,020
cool

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,090
and others to group sending balloons up
into space in taking snapshots the

33
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,719
planet

34
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,009
and you know these are things that take
off and now I'm

35
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,359
some other things that were really cool
kind of like a a

36
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,939
at crash space you know they're cool
ideas but there was never any into

37
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,759
another people to make a coalescing just
have to

38
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,360
like oh those and me that makes room for
whatever's next

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,020
re

40
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,330
pre-show you may have been referencing
are thus the 150 ideas that we have on

41
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,440
the project page

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,670
and we we're talking about giving things
priority

43
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,970
like this is going to be an idea that's
going to happen and this me something

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,130
that we're not going to India

45
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,310
so I think that is a nice also an
important factor

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,690
make things happen and

47
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,100
more one thing though yup we also do
this every

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,710
every single meeting we have something
to do we were

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,370
right now it is rare the trying to get
space we we meet biweekly

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,080
and every meeting there always be a set
schedule to vent

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,500
that's promoted for two weeks and that
law

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,060
and that generates a a lot of interest
and it grows a space because

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,210
people will only although send the
invites out that they're getting on the

54
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,500
subject to all their friends

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,020
and it really if the gross things very
quickly

56
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,450
how one thing that brought it up

57
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,820
for us well lust you where the third
birthday

58
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,070
and we found out people like an excuse

59
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,930
to make cool things so makin

60
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,450
if you have a reason to make an
exhibition of something

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,200
offered him basis for the project and
the deadline

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,510
and suddenly the

63
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,950
might be Fife more project happening
before the

64
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,010
before the deadline that didn't exist
before

65
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,410
so that's cool and another thing

66
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,810
anything space-related up band

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,760
the trees someone said and

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,929
replace it by will and

69
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,080
things at least discussions about
products would become bearable

70
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,490
um we've had to school and

71
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,610
yeah I I can fight no

72
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,319
like telling people like that or just
like someone should do this is like the

73
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,530
worst possible thing

74
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,030
again cool

75
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,620
thank you this actually really great
question-and-answer session

76
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,620
ever how many but for those guys and
we're going to the back this time

77
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,810

94
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,479
next hopefully serious question i has
one if anyone

95
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,479
and the panel organizations the
representative if any you identify

96
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,938
yourself as something other than a
hackerspace

97
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,740
recently in my hackerspace in Chicago
for discussions about

98
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,759
using other terms like nigger space
community workshop

99
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,909
mean you're on the Challenger love
discussions with

100
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,748
with possible sponsorships and the term
hacker space and

101
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:02,229
in how people initially acted that Tom
so

102
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,339
was interested to see with the panel
thinks about determine if it's important

103
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,839
and in what it means and what you're
using

104
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,080
do she joined at this month

105
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,210
on for would I I don't remember

106
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:21,169
what phrase we use I was like to travel
with them our website

107
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,099
but

108
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,350
we had this we had this

109
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,300
issue early on we're forming we're gonna
be a maker space

110
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,180
or hackerspace we were thinking let's be
a make the space because they want to

111
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,070
appeal to everyone and sound good

112
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,560
and then I said let's be active space

113
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,670
because we want to do that too and break
stuff so

114
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,120
at it's really important to own the word

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,740
space actually I love you know you know
of a collaborative workspace out the

116
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,280
makers base

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,190
occasionally even I think it's really
important to keep using the free

118
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,060
tax-paid

119
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:04,060
really be what you are and that have
fill the word yet because it connects

120
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,840
worldwide every year five eastern yeah
and is actually

121
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,990
a good thing that the term hacker get
some kind of like definition of credit

122
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:19,190
yeah we've we kinda with credit taken
that the posture abusing hacker as much

123
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,000
as possible and when anybody

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,850
responds with any kind of question or
hesitation we like blatantly make fun of

125
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,460
them for like believing like hollywood
movies and stuff for like you know that

126
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,220
this is an

127
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,640
this isn't like that crap this is right
actual hackers you know and then we

128
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,289
started making

129
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,800
opens a chance for us to explain like
what happens to you which

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,290
you know service makes things better for
everybody you know we've had the

131
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,580
the idea that use a hackerspace and you
look for that twitch

132
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,909
and if you see them Twitter don't take a
breath just say it's peace rebuilding

133
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,370
the critical stuff

134
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,220
yeah it's a community space and you know
if we're spending

135
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,490
a a lot of our energy or any of our
energy worrying about what some mythical

136
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,960
other might think about us

137
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,980
then we're doing a disservice to
ourselves and the mythical other so

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,860
the by owning the word hacker and
hackerspace Noisebridge has generated an

139
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,990
incredible amount

140
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,290
love very positive Press in the
mainstream

141
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,200
and you just wrote an article that fits
in with that as well

142
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,610
about hackers bases so if we keep
putting it out there and there's so many

143
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,670
examples above

144
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,330
so many of us in this room doing
positive things for ourselves and the

145
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,859
people around us in the world

146
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,000
the people take notice and

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,650
a hacker is becoming more positive as a
result I also think that like that some

148
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,760
others other terms

149
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,169
imply something else you know and might
attract a different sort of person you

150
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:39,900
know they're sorta

151
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,718
was at Tech shop where you can sort have
become a member and

152
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,290
does you not expected interactive
community I just going to certain use

153
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,300
the tools and everything and so I think
wake

154
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,880
trying to like incorporate those terms
to make things more

155
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,800
you know like friendly media wise
attract people who aren't necessarily

156
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,050
interested in a community and I think
that

157
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,310
a community is a is a huge Corp are the
hackerspace

158
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,530
and access for some people so

159
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,819
at NYC resistor we had a early member
named Dino

160
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,850
unit as OB is a very talented security
researcher

161
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,100
on he ended up leaving the group for
different reasons

162
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,260
and a is now he runs in a and why sec
meeting on Tuesdays

163
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,470
me during the month of which week at the
month that is but

164
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,350
iight early on we lost a lot of our kids
offer

165
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,420
like specifically software talent and we
became more focused and hardware

166
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,079
and I think that's kinda the negative
side that's the kind of problem with

167
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,480
being a mate a maker spaces you can a
chain yourself more to the maker culture

168
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,850
which is differentiated itself in the
past from the hack culture

169
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,900
Riley richly how to hack into make
different blogs

170
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,819
on hackerspace kinda is all-inclusive in
a way

171
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,940
I i understand that may have some
derogatory terminology but I think we're

172
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,760
changing that

173
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,100
I like the idea of this on the culture
that consumes all

174
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,650
things in allows for the read reuse and
repurpose nation in this mix of cultures

175
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,280
and

176
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,319
the use of technology in different ways
by different people regardless a softer

177
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,750
hard

178
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,120
%uh this project I know

179
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,290
are Iran hardware and software in

180
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,900
and stuff like that anyway said and
craft an art and whatever hearted

181
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,030
everything 0 you had are

182
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,209
we had alarm a a good portion of the
above makers an hour and a half space

183
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,390
while we're at FIU because we had the
infrastructure their sport we had tables

184
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,439
with rflp

185
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,209
silly little school when we moved the
kind of the kind of stayed behind

186
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,180
because as

187
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,910
there's really no no room for that at at
a pizza mentioned but for reader

188
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,170
regarding the regarding the the city
where hackers

189
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,400
hacker hacker space um had allow the
user to have married as very is very

190
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,950
much

191
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,100
in the realm of studying techniques have
an authorized access and

192
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,800
and arm the update interception and up
malware

193
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,760
and a button that type stuff but it's
not it's not that we're doing it for it

194
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,350
for the

195
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,530
for the bad side not you know the when
people hear hackerspace its

196
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,800
if by now they're associating with
someone automatically selling credit

197
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
card numbers or

198
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,650
that have a stuff then then they're
stupid and we don't really even deal

199
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,310
with them

200
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,610
I'm allow to the a lot of whom were to
allow the new

201
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,140
corporations stuff what doctor say they
understand it's just mostly

202
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,470
wanna Billy O's penetration testers and
they're just going about it

203
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,640
on completely ethical way and on

204
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,080
that the word hacker cup has that as
well it's all just

205
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,920
it's more a cultural thing instead of
criminal

206
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,280
throwing it back to the back um yeah

207
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,250
first off I want to say I I heard about
hackerspace is

208
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,530
about a week ago and had no idea he has
been very informative

209
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,670
like this whole idea second of Nick

210
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,000
for you are as I'm also resident DC and
I want to hear about

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,330
hack DC little bit everyone else has
said something but think everything from

212
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,510
you

213
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,550
but before you go into that remind on

214
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,760
the real question everyone ask is what
kind of connection US have their

215
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,839
colleges because

216
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm really interesting going to Stanford
and crash space

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,089
sounds like very interesting thing I
would like to

218
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,220
find out about or group our way yet
worker in Los Angeles

219
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,730
UCLA team for

220
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,020
gallard there that again month think
that

221
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,329
it closer to break there's actually
Sanford is and Silicon Valley

222
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:43,870
usually call it silly Billy silly place
but the

223
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,089
the next suburb over is Mountain View
and there's acrid odor which is a really

224
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:49,530
cool hackerspace

225
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,660
right there

226
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,300
I guess just answer that question had
PCs still doing really great they just

227
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,550
moved into their

228
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,130
larger space fortunately the same
building

229
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,530
so that's cool and the great thing about
this is that right about now

230
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:10,740
to New hackerspace is one DC's normally
split I guess three zones in northern

231
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,410
virginia their central the CNN there's
Montgomery PG county

232
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,180
in maryland unallocated space which is
getting going on

233
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,850
proud to be area a member this this
starting

234
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,490
collective which is good all the
hackerspace right between ac dc

235
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,530
and Baltimore note in Baltimore and

236
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,540
Southern Maryland now on the poorest EC
and

237
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,599
also red space River space is opening up

238
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,680
near Dulles Airport in Virginia so now
is actually

239
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,260
a really great time for space in DCM
glad somebody brought that up that I

240
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,630
could

241
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,180
point that out but yep are you up now

242
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,240
now that I'm finishing my own little
corner back the front for another

243
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,810
question

244
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,230
I've actually strangely just been
thinking about buying a bus

245
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,050
bottom it strikes me that driving around
from community to community and

246
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,420
well from place to place and trying to
form a community

247
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,300
overnights with you know a few hundred
square feet of space to call your own

248
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,350
would actually be a challenge that might
be beyond

249
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,079
me personally but had me thinking them

250
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,230
does a view that mentioned specific
sizes for you have two spaces

251
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,560
kinda mostly mention numbers with the
exception of bridge between one and two

252
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,190
thousand square feet

253
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,030
and that's kinda the size that the
original ways which space was as well I

254
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,819
have many pleasant memories from

255
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,030
even though the giant was but space has
been good for me and my projects

256
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,110
I must admit I feel a certain amount
missed alger for

257
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,630
the cramped pressure cooker that we had
originally I'm

258
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,950
and I don't really know if I can
extrapolate from that

259
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,180
thinking that there is some kind
community benefit like everybody feels a

260
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,350
little bit

261
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,400
more on the spot for being perhaps more
considerate of other people

262
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,600
or other projects and things like that
but kinda wondering what you guys

263
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,040
collectively thought about that about
whether you know that grows

264
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,540
whatever effects you expect to have from
growing too much as bases or what you've

265
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,110
seen or what you think might be

266
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,390
effects just one for

267
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,449
comment considered the heck this thing
is that you know the comment that said

268
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,660
call for help

269
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,069
on because the thing is up there all the
time we study the Beijing less than they

270
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,840
would like you to subscribe

271
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,750
on the meeting list because wanna solve
the problem it would be really great to

272
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,990
have something like it

273
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,510
on like it tracking system for help us

274
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,500
and we try to develop that they're
actually systems are there to do that

275
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,420
but we've just too stupid to do that

276
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,620
CPRS your your haikus out there so maybe

277
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,670
subscribe to a list that mean we can get
it working Adam

278
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,970
but no back to the hackerspace question
them

279
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,760
okay this is a the I'm kinda sad triple
see guys left

280
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,870
I i think there's a a fundamental point
at which a hackerspace has to decide

281
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,910
whether it's gonna

282
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,439
rise above being just the sum total its
community

283
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,050
and allow taxpayers to you either become
something more

284
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,760
like the Triple C did when they lay down
their bylaws and said

285
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,860
we are the Triple C in this thing that
we create is going to outlast us

286
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,970
that limits your way I becomes more obey

287
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,230
a foundation for very large organization

288
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,770
and as he said that means you lose that
community

289
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:21,600
its more strict guidelines are designed
to further the Triple C for a very long

290
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,720
time

291
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,070
and maybe that will happen the United
States I kinda hope it doesn't because I

292
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,390
agree with you I like

293
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,319
this the community aspect like knowing
the people

294
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,100
being I like that each one of us is
completely different people who are very

295
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,650
much

296
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,150
born a bar geographic location or the
people who just

297
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,930
work together to build our our community

298
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,160
assert the picture the world as the
Paleolithic era and there's all these

299
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,260
dinosaurs around you have the universe
is even a few tiny

300
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,279
and they were joined body and get their
attention takes a lot

301
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,290
and to get them moving somewhere takes
off but the move when the movie as a

302
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,779
whole huge thing

303
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,830
and eyes pictures next is more like the
little your raptors and

304
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,390
tiny you know their smaller agile they
may

305
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,699
que salir of class for getting by
something larger arm

306
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:10,720
yen in it as you know as you look at
Evolution things go from being small and

307
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,860
they find an agent and they grow in that
niche

308
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,040
and it gets actually what's happening
right now Naxos community is

309
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,408
a lot of people found the initial fill
in the thing is who's gonna grow

310
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:22,830
you know what new variants of this idea
are gonna grow to fill that

311
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,208
median age I'm I think that's kind of
what we're finding out the US right now

312
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,580
home excellent Germany experiment and
had a little longer history

313
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,820
on I personally feel it if we keep the
terror that already existed in this

314
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,220
we are going to keep the small adult
space is already more tiny spaces like

315
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,070
in garages and basements

316
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,658
and then we I think you know some
communal the site for community 3 to

317
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,409
grow

318
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:46,919
on but you know I we we start around
seven hundred square foot

319
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,280
and moved about 2,500 and actually
there's motorcycles can fund like

320
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,620
be lovely do this and hit half the
people in the hackerspace

321
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,760
think for hackerspace is it possible to
have like

322
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,429
specific like rate

323
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:05,990
for example within our hitting clubs
there's a specific group of people

324
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,100
the thing free who on who meet up

325
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,370
on their own time Aki thing plans to

326
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,040
work on mir space projects so there is
still

327
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,418
a way for people to meet up together and
do their

328
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,419
on projects it's just with them brown

329
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,980
how specific again

330
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,300
um yes I live in a not very large city
where the only place to buy power

331
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,720
supplies Best Buy

332
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,270
and I'm currently work for business that
I have an opportunity to open

333
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,850
hackerspace by 12

334
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,390
and I was wondering if it would be
better to go for not-for-profit to help

335
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,180
you know my community mourned giving
them an area to work in our

336
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,370
it would be better to do for-profit
place and what's the problems you guys

337
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,130
had going for not-for-profit or for
profit I think I'm

338
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,650
the back till on the we are for-profit
um

339
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,280
the benefits a for-profit are simple its

340
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,230
very easy on in fact your 5-on-3 seeing
you

341
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,400
don't finish your paperwork you end up
being a for-profit so

342
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,130
it is the fact defacto standard want to
incorporate you are

343
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,230
a for-profit until you finish your 513
see on

344
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,540
the taxes are a little bit easier to do
but you run into some weird

345
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,810
in currencies sadly with them with the
not-for-profit our founders

346
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,870
every year and up having to pay taxes

347
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,180
on the LLC and then we have to reimburse
them after the fact is kinda

348
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,890
kinda a pain for them because if the
files extra paperwork they have to pay

349
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,190
lay down this money they get paid back
on

350
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,050
but we have other benefits where if like
discover channel or some

351
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,379
other group comes to us and says hey
we'd like to do something with you

352
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,570
we can negotiate with them without any
restrictions being a 513 see

353
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,120
however we also don't get free stuff
from universities when they go hey we're

354
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,420
throwing out our old

355
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,920
you know furniture would you like some
on

356
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,650
each where you go I mean the FY 13 sees
guys can speak to it but I we've had

357
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,870
some real benefits in terms were
partnerships and how we do things

358
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,020
you know eso

359
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,040
and with your sister and Noisebridge
were born out of

360
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,180
chaos camp 2007 the same place at the
same time

361
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,640
in with your sister with the breed

362
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,770
a and the group a founding including
Matt arm

363
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,840
decided to go the easy you route up
getting LLC and they were a hackerspace

364
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,649
within several weeks

365
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,710
Noisebridge recap meeting and talking
about it but what would be better for

366
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,770
profit nonprofit and for non-profit work
I nonprofit been

367
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,430
tree membership would border and on and
on and on and on

368
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,960
and we didn't get together to hack the
law we got together to hack the planet

369
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,170
so from but from

370
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,150
yes oh it's an arduous process but the
things we we ended up collecting enough

371
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,950
money

372
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,490
just from you know five dollars here 25
over there to get two thousand dollars

373
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,080
together

374
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,449
to pay a lawyer who exists primarily to
create

375
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,510
non-profit 501 c3 in the United States

376
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,990
and she did a great job

377
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,360
and it took it a about your but we are
now 51 c3

378
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,130
and aren tire process is

379
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,550
document didn't most if it is now on our
website

380
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,840
I including olive the um the paperwork
we had to do for the IRS

381
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,010
for the state of California most states
are

382
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,430
have a lot of differences but there's a
lot of overlap so

383
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,820
no space um I'm hoping

384
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,090
will need to spend two thousand dollars
to go through that process again and

385
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,919
maybe even short-circuited to

386
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,300
a few months rather than a year um

387
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,820
there are lot of trade-offs for every
decision you make

388
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,050
what we wanted to do at Noisebridge in I
would recommend

389
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,320
this approach for everyone is to create
a legal structure

390
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,639
I'll bet as closely as possible reflects

391
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,970
who you ours group it's not going to be

392
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,940
exactly the same because the laws one
thing in our day-to-day reality lives

393
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,360
are

394
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,530
another a but for us %uh being the

395
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,720
you know that he be pumping anarchists
etcetera a group that we are being a

396
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,870
non-profit

397
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,670
on membership run organization sued us

398
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,190
%uh reflected us the best so that's why
we went that way

399
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,820
um you know brie I've known for a long
time he's very much

400
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,700
expedient let's just get things done and
hack and so the LOC was really good

401
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,350
approach

402
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,860
up for them a NYC resistor doesn't
actually make profit

403
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,730
is just an expedient way to get legal
structure of income

404
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,210
well that's not strictly to true
according to the IRS we've made a profit

405
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,140
every year even when we moved and tried
to drive or a cost so high that would

406
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,890
make a profit

407
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,970
but a I what the court in lines

408
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,700
what he's talking about I think you have
to fundamentally identify what happened

409
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,990
spaces

410
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,420
and I consider it a library for doing
and in that regard you do have private

411
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,360
and public libraries and they serve
different wrists but as it is your

412
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,620
kinda satins cookie-cutter mold 501 3c

413
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,070
or LLC or something to that effect and
there's nothing else

414
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,159
I would actually really encourage people
to mod on I

415
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,429
intimidating and I think hackers basing
their wonderful opportunity to really

416
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:32,550
sort

417
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,570
push the boundaries we started as
corporate looking into becoming a 501 c3

418
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,899
but there's a lot of stuff like in
vermont there's a low-profit

419
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,190
corporations and there's a lot of and
and social entrepreneurship world

420
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,060
there's a lot of really interesting
legal people work going on attempt at

421
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,210
trying to you

422
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,520
to redefine what's possible business
structure and I think honestly

423
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,650
you know as much as

424
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,080
you know that were there it s NBA's
community for good reason

425
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,250
I there's some really interesting stuff
particularly in the social

426
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,730
entrepreneurship community

427
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,360
better that are going on and I think we
should try to push our state

428
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,480
committed to giving were interesting
corporate structures

429
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,250
and you know you can just started and
file free by the with a great leader

430
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,900
and I love I forgot to mention one of
the advantages of being 501 c3 is it

431
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,290
a induces people gives people an
incentive to donate

432
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,490
and when we got her space we instantly
needed

433
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,780
first month last month and deposit very
quickly

434
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,510
um so within 24 hours being a non-profit
we got

435
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,810
twelve thousand dollars that wouldn't
happen for us if we weren't

436
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:45,790
nonprofit and just imagine options is
also of 51 c11 you can form a

437
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,659
cooperative

438
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,870
in a lot of states if you're a
cooperative over the members and there's

439
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,270
not

440
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,090
he someone owning stock in you that
that's considered a state nonprofit also

441
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,470
on a 501 c3

442
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,550
so there are some other the evil
vehicles out there you know serving or

443
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,120
every

444
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,270
States a little different some states
are awesome some really suck so

445
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,280
I guess it you know I'm not aware but

446
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,490
maybe if you can google 1 they may be a
welcome

447
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,170
on that note we personally 8 doing our
taxes

448
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,260
we have an accountant and I highly
recommend that hacker space is at least

449
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,860
for the first couple years

450
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,270
you get an account walked through with
them make sure that you don't screw up

451
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,040
in and up

452
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,100
situation where you a lot money to the
IRS I mean you're gonna run situation

453
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,770
very end up owing money it happen to you
even to the

454
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,230
sea bass guys with our power bill so you
know you gotta be careful you wanna

455
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,929
you know be really smart build up a a
cash buffer but you really want to make

456
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,679
sure that when you go through this stuff
you have professional sit down with you

457
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:47,679
pay money if you have to and you know
figure it out to it right the first time

458
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,340
on as was know that one of our members
has

459
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,640
how to set up a million iSuppli about
100 spaces outward forearm

460
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,820
finances just getting everyone who does
finances an actor spaces to

461
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,290
together to talk about you know the
problem that having and how to fix and

462
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,139
things like that

463
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,320
as you say the the nightmare from the
501 c3 paperwork

464
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,919
are makes supposedly the IRS is saying
that they're going to have it

465
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,330
they can do it on online web application
by the end of the year

466
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,040
we'll see how fast they move on that a
rift even goodbye then

467
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,330
normally cost three hundred dollars to
file 501 c3

468
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,899
they bump that up to four hundred
dollars now and then if you do it online

469
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,530
its

470
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,980
three hundred dollars so that's also
something to think about maybe

471
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,310
might wanna wait to actually have it up
and running to and save yourself some

472
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,790
money and do it online

473
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,639
are more that the government who knows
when I'll have it done

474
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,679
and Noisebridge on the bottom of our
front pages

475
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,650
all the information for 501 c3 if you
want to check that out and see if it's

476
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,260
something that you and your space
orienting

477
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,390
right next question so a I guess I grew
up

478
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,470
with the advent of hacker spaces and

479
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,080
I was really lucky to have shop in my
basement when I was growing up so I

480
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,510
could just build stuff

481
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,550
but as soon as I you know chose to go to
college

482
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,000
others and the question is is there
going to be a place for me to play

483
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,030
I really thinking dorm room i ended up
being lucky enough to have something

484
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,918
like murders

485
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,840
and a few guys have heard of it bud as I
understand it's a pretty unique place

486
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,650
any university there aren't too many a
student-run machine shops

487
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:31,440
that are also open to the public and
something that I would call hackerspace

488
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,710
in the University a I was wondering what
you guys are

489
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,050
think about trying to stardom where
these Kenneth University

490
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,129
actors faces that are completely to

491
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,860
self sufficient they make money from
some other thing we

492
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,830
get it from working at a electronics
like sup s meet

493
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,510
on and Mike I think you'd be really good
idea chain push this

494
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,640
and other universities I'm so just
before anyone answers that would like to

495
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,000
point out that such a really good idea
for you in a Royal Air

496
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,310
rural area contact your local college
was lucky guys do have machine shops and

497
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,178
lava may not mention it publicly but
they do actually have like

498
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:11,060
you going to do it quick training course
not give you access at certain times

499
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,629
during the day

500
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,990
it's like their libraries you can pay a
monthly us mister fee to use it

501
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,470
depending on the school can make you
some whatever local resources you have

502
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,400
universities libraries you know whatever
robotics group Linux user group

503
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,140
whatever's available make use it you
know they're that's part of our

504
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,240
community

505
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,929
yet the copier on that of course is that
if you're you doing

506
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:35,630
fat with the university or business or
something else

507
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,980
there's always somebody else who can
sort of pull the rug out you know

508
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,030
and surveyed out your hand so your
freedom for a while but

509
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,720
there something else like kinda Bay
controls the strings not something to be

510
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,140
aware

511
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,990
I went to university with a computer
science have some actually loved it was

512
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,409
great

513
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:54,210
and we actually made are extra money for
plane taking trips

514
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,570
by running our own computer part which
was you know like a campus computer part

515
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,158
but was kinda

516
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,340
just in with the dorms we were open
later things like that

517
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,380
and ran into exactly that after a couple
years university said well this is

518
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,280
making us money

519
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,770
turn that for dorm rooms in was gonna
shut you down

520
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,970
I'm so they definitely go for that but
also understand that

521
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,510
you know it's one other designers
situations your you would have had to

522
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,760
stand on their own

523
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,060
in if you're not gonna do yeah we should
really reminded people to check out the

524
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,350
heck spaces design patterns because
they're pretty much out there

525
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,900
and Jens all the one of the guys who
wrote them pretty much says no

526
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,179
do not do it do not like get yourself
attached to a bigger institution

527
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:35,750
that can dominate you in some form so
they try to be independent that's what

528
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,600
he says

529
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,200
and it most of the time XVI's true and
if you're going to do something

530
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,159
different just be aware that there's a
good reason why I was

531
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,659
it's very come to do online if you doing
in another way just beware

532
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,090
the reasons why we started our
hackerspace is because at

533
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:57,159
I'm a lot of us found that our universe
teaser wherever we're starting school on

534
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,600
a lot of these universities have access
to resources that we don't know about or

535
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,919
like huge 3d printers that they bought
from a lot of money from the nurses

536
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,820
money but

537
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,889
I much for taking class around this time
I Z likes you

538
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,780
you don't get access to these privileges
so on

539
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,399
thats thats I mean if the University

540
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,780
supports you and lets you use everything
that

541
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,710
all the things that you want to do and
pushes you forward but this idea

542
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,429
hyperspace

543
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:29,090
that's great I think you should there is
a hackerspace

544
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,290
escorts called and what I

545
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,500
you know about them and I was talking to
someone from there and I found

546
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,770
fascinating about their

547
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,240
is that ok was was shocked reston

548
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,800
charge member fees or whatever as a no
it's free and you looking at me for RSS

549
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,950
are you serious yeah so that's that's a
benefit

550
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,740
willing to be aware of those
universities are really paranoid about

551
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,360
go for it over there network

552
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,510
so it's better for machine shops but if
you want any more %uh

553
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,190
them IT department thank you really
really upset it here

554
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,770
packets in yet as soon as you want to
buy

555
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,040
at want to build like sex machines and
stuff like that or on

556
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,540
like frame the flame throwing robots I
mean moody University with

557
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,730
not enough boxes Anchorage shipped to
you

558
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:24,450
um next question I i was gonna mention
some real bass is also a nasa

559
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,940
taxpayers at one other places

560
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:33,290
yeah they're working with the Titan one

561
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,700
yeah I just want to put in a good word
for the hackerspace we built in phnom

562
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,730
rallied Chapel Hill term area 20,000
square feet

563
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,010
we have a lot of people about eighty
percent of the people that were at the

564
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,379
local 2600 meetings for years

565
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,350
are the core group in it and there was a
disparaging remark made by the gentleman

566
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,780
to mitch is right

567
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,129
about tech shop so we sold all over
financial

568
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,770
and home liability issues by be opening
tech shop but the founder is a is a

569
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,330
hacker

570
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,800
apps serious intent and

571
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,990
if we don't have a flame throwing or
plasma shooting project

572
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,419
you know going on he's like not happy
cell we were told we absolutely turning

573
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:16,120
it is a hackerspace that's the phrase we
use

574
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,159
and so you know tech shop doesn't have
to be

575
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,419
like handcuffs and in the service stuff
so will be too high and

576
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:25,360
hackerspace were experimenting we'll see
if it works but like I said the people

577
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,100
he said it up

578
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,580
I'm one of the original people setting
up we're were all like

579
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,810
there the rules are all the reasonable
rules and inward morning

580
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,418
you know everything else but that should
be taken as a disparaging organising

581
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:40,179
their different things yeah it but from
like a public perspective

582
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,280
the at least his work Los Angeles and

583
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,760
in california rather like people are
interested in tech tech shops

584
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,790
was different then people were injured
hackerspace right

585
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,350
I but a lot of us could go for the
machines we went there for the machines

586
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,659
but

587
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:57,419
its absolutely about the community I ago
there for the people

588
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,490
and its in it again like I said the
overlap between the 2600 meetings in the

589
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,740
people that are there a tech shop

590
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,950
almost you know daily on it and clean it
up to the fence and it is it's a high

591
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,679
and tight it's a high and had a space

592
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,780
we're not we're not breaking even yet
it's it's the for-profit model

593
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,960
but that is one way to solve a liability
issues and everything all

594
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,050
all at once you just get a boilerplate
you know and and then you really had

595
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,550
people came to our first meeting who

596
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,290
thought the idea does coming to a
meeting where they had to like talk to

597
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,020
other people was

598
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,800
was a negative thing and in never come
back because they didn't want to talk to

599
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,669
people they just wanted like

600
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:35,300
you know access to lead a kinder he
wears is ours I like them

601
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,090
bother me I just a side note picture i'm
a i'm a lifetime member

602
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,480
tech shop at home I and on heard

603
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,200
Jim Newton who started texting but he's
a great guy takes up isn't

604
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,260
a header space but there's a great deal
of overlap between the two

605
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,570
and Noisebridge we recently worked out a

606
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,200
reciprocal agreement where anyone who is
a member of tech shop gets half price

607
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,840
membership at Noisebridge anyone who is
a member

608
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,860
%uh Noisebridge gets half price
membership the tech shop

609
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,560
and assuming this works out in I it will
it is

610
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:12,560
arm fiscal probably expanded for all
hackerspace is

611
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,210
shot that we wouldn't have and say we
don't have any concerns

612
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,940
think this mass questions that is good

613
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,720
thing done times outside he real quick

614
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,600
what's up with the hackerspace Olympics
her

615
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,480
up hunters these Olympics is an idea
that was pretty much

616
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,830
some created by people at pumping
station 1

617
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,529
Chicago other and

618
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,929
are other pump station when people in

619
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,530
in the so yeah

620
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,230
the idea is to help from the competition
to encourage creativity and

621
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:58,150
is it actually happening at the Detroit
Maker Faire

622
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,940
okay so one other things happening at
the tried making the fair will be

623
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,130
to accomplish enough people using he's

624
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,420
a toys for adults

625
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,359
Power Wheels II soo ping them up but
using stock

626
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,240
abadi so better be a really fun things
to see all these foreign people bopping

627
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,040
around in those at very high speeds

628
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,790
%uh unsafe at any speed for sure from
moving bobbing around ideas

629
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,600
love having sort uva a hackerspace

630
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,350
triathlon competition where something
like cum

631
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,620
you you have to creates software which
will perform some task

632
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,600
and when you do that you get a clue love
where to find a box that has a whole

633
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,799
bunch of

634
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,480
lock that you have to pick can you open
up the boxes

635
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,020
blocks and then insider some um parts
that you have to build

636
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,940
and when you build them then you have to
turn off the TV across the room or

637
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,190
something

638
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,640
um yes oh I don't know but it really
hasn't gelled into

639
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,180
