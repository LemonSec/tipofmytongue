1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,080
the common bond the fellowship among
those who had assured in a new era of

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,049
communications led to the founding

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,040
up the Association in 1911 from its
inception

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,719
there was the realization that pay
nearing was not solely a characteristic

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,400
early telephone development the only
requirement for em membership

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,279
was soon established as 21 years of
service in the industry

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,090
expressing the concept of pioneering as
a continuous process

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,570
the industry was then as now vigorous
growing and changing business

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,120
every improvement created the stimulus
for further improvements to meet the

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,599
ever-increasing demands for better and
faster communication

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,090
and this because gone goes on from there
and as a great

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,530
great primer if if you wanna get into
the real like

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,600
not simple to the history I'm gonna go
kinda quickly because

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,730
it's about a hundred years the history
so

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,920
this is the patent the original patent
that was

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,989
I am the impetus for up

17
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,270
Bell beginning to have a service

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,129
and I'm a

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,490
basically the

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,429
the Pioneers arm they work so hard on
the system they wanted to

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,180
have a way to continue and to continue
learning to continue

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,140
doing what they did they had established
this thing the system that nobody really

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,110
knew very much about it was mysterious
as I said Bell didn't really understand

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,400
electricity

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,930
when he first developed the phone he
understood sound very well

26
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,090
and but continued learning continue
progressing and as the system grew

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,130
that was that was something they wanted
to keep alive and and that is

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,949
what I just read the the the part of
their mission was to

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,740
encourage this continuous learning this
continuous process

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,810
love being engaged in telecommunications
and and and their hobbies and an act and

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,329
stuff

32
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,670
so I'm this is this is a arm

33
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,689
I and early receipt for your
subscription

34
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:04,149
and this was before there was is like
some the early a subscriber suffers from

35
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:05,439
1877

36
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,280
on in this is the first telephone
advertisement and I'm

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,209
this was the first a

38
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,950
advertisement a advertising the tote

39
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,270
telephonic systems as a as a Service I'm

40
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,569
and I think this this is offering the

41
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,770
a.m. the actual

42
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,840
a ability to contact an operator and and

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,470
have in 10 conversations as a little bit
later on

44
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,470
these were the first workers in the
telephone system

45
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,120
and I they were young young people
hackers people that

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,150
could could you know switch some other
calls as people were starting to

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,170
um use telephones for communication with
people and and and have them in their

48
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,230
homes or businesses

49
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,760
but in workout because they they weren't
very good as the customer service

50
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,390
representatives so our clients and I'm
sure love you seen this picture

51
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,040
um have another one love a cartoon from
a little bit later

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,140
love how the the the younger man workers
would not be as courteous as operators

53
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,450
but

54
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,030
these were some of the kinks they didn't
really know how to operate a

55
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,870
the company has a as a service to people
and and

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,280
so you know there's there's some really
funny statements on here

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,739
I that their their careless and

58
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,739
selfish in that kinda stuff so they lack
occurs in it showing at the female

59
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,690
operators

60
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,900
who have courtesy in that kinda stuff
medical success

61
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,900
course I am so it's slowly the the bell
system like again to take off in the a.m

62
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,549
they had an initiative they had like a a
purpose for I

63
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,150
creating an actual company around this
invention so it

64
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,430
in I was put into words that they were
dumb provide the service

65
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,470
locally and then ever-expanding brought
liked in it and the statements actually

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,870
circle that talks about

67
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,890
having service throughout the known
world arm

68
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,370
answer so again their pain nearing the
the

69
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,899
their new territory they didn't have
this wasn't bells purpose he just wanted

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,229
to

71
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,120
transmit voice over wires he didn't
necessarily envision

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,419
a way of like having many subscribers or
anything like that

73
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,758
he had really good people around him to
support

74
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,690
the invention and create a business that
actually sustain itself

75
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,000
on so this is the first switch in
Seattle

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
I am first telephone exchange
switchboard

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,610
there was actually from the service is a
little later 1883

78
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,340
I am and

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,120
this is Graham Bell opening the Chicago
New York long-distance circuit in

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,040
1892 this is really interesting is a
candlestick phones that

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,750
are left in people's homes that a

82
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,080
you can quickly bring your operator and
have your service re initiated

83
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,349
so again it's like they're just figuring
out

84
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,660
what are the models like how do we it
how can we expand this network from what

85
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,419
is it useful for know the stuff was
known it was all new territory

86
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,440
um and these were some the other jobs
that people ended up doing

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,949
I they expanded significantly in
CreateInstance

88
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,630
connecting many many cities and and and

89
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,690
ike's you know basically a growing their
network in

90
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,130
in the the technology is evolving at the
same time a.m.

91
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,350
so I'm these are some the plant workers
these are guys that are actually out

92
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,259
there building the system and this is
where that fellowship comes from

93
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:50,460
I s coming from something that's very
new very I'm serious is and again they

94
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,739
don't fully understand what they're
doing but it's slowly growing and

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,919
becoming a bigger

96
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,330
and bigger system and they start I
having a lot of employees and

97
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,419
and out of this invention and this
summer

98
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,719
um growth very rapid growth I mean they
had

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,600
keep up with a lot of changes in in you
know they're competing with a leg if

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Tiger fee separate Telegraph E and

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,009
just trying to be keep I keep pace with
themselves actually I mean the

102
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,009
innovation just

103
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,039
is a exponential and at a certain point
just continues to grow

104
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,280
so they had a real culture like social
group forming a lot of people

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,600
arm working together to build the system
out

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
I'm this is particularly and interesting
as I said the

107
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,530
operators were young guys at first but
it didn't work out because I've

108
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,419
courteous NIS

109
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,068
and so they had I female operators and

110
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,430
arm this is a very like a divers
workfare workforce but

111
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,300
they they eat everybody found spots in
and again

112
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,599
on I just want to emphasize you know it

113
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,300
this is a woman of course and their is a
serious streak

114
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,310
love women working doing like serious
stuff supervisory roles managers like

115
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,669
big time within this

116
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,599
this growing company they're a part of
this like pain your spirit

117
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,610
that that's slowly builds up um and even
people again with disabilities

118
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:20,580
I'm this is a point operator real quick

119
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,130
you know I'm not sure I I would imagine
I mean again the innovated all kinds of

120
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,050
stuff I'm

121
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,560
shirt year that they would have fights
I'm sure they'd the adapted it so that

122
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,639
she could feel

123
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,370
what number in this kinda stuff but I'm
childhood questions love it cuz I gotta

124
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,660
pick up momentum here I'm already
running a little late

125
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,789
I'm so again this work for six Panthers
there are

126
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,409
evolving system they have a much bigger
switchboard that's that's

127
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,979
be coming into use and many more
subscribers and it just

128
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,068
like continued on from there so I'm

129
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,169
these are you know many many operators a
huge for civ women

130
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,940
their arm controlling calls and and and

131
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,490
getting people talking to with their you
know we were trying to hold off

132
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,889
and and again it's it's a business and
it's its

133
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:07,970
you know that spirit have their I'm

134
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,389
there to provide the service and you
know be loyal to their

135
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,990
their subscribers in all of that so um

136
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,930
with this like a as is another one

137
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,410
love I'll slightly more than switchboard
with this

138
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,590
armed they began to some

139
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,900
get a culture and I kinda like spoke
this little bit but

140
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,339
that's where the arm they wanted to
continue basically the

141
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,130
the plane years came out of a people
that were leaving the system they had

142
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,469
been there and and

143
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,200
been very loyally work for the company
that innovated they done a lot of things

144
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,190
they wanted to keep that that ingenuity
that spirit

145
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,130
and that just the feeling of you created
something it never before existed this

146
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,260
is a very

147
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,140
like new realm new territory in
technology and so

148
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,529
they slowly started to build the

149
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:01,600
the plane your organization at 1911 is

150
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,660
it was when it was founded and and that
provided

151
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,240
on and outlet for people that were
leaving they had been there for thirty

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,570
years that kind of thing

153
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,080
so they could continue I'm associating
with people that they had

154
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,529
built this amazing thing with stay
engaged

155
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:21,760
I you know end also serve the community
that they'd spent their careers and

156
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,880
arm and there's also a streak of hobby
because

157
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,100
allow these people are attacked all the
they'd work with their hands they had

158
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,300
built the system so they emphasize that

159
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,450
a you know continuing your own interests
and in your own pursuits

160
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,560
and again this this organization was
basically

161
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,860
a place for them to to feel

162
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,300
the a still associated not like they had
just left in an abandoned

163
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,959
on I want to quickly talk about
architectural because these buildings

164
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,120
are amazing

165
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,410
um and these are a couple pictures so
the Seattle buildings that women

166
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,899
on and this is what they're building an
end if you look at a lot of what they

167
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,920
wear and

168
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,000
and the architecture its it's a really
successful business I mean it's just

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,480
beautiful to me

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,540
um and this history is is really really
fun to look at

171
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:17,540
um so these are couple shots over
Seattle office

172
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:26,929
I like this one its forty five thousand
dollars it's really nice building for

173
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,309
forty five thousand dollars

174
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:31,309
of course at the time it was probably a
lot money

175
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:36,719
I am and this is speaks to you hover
bust it was

176
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,009
mean the stuff they were building the
way the design things they're built to

177
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:40,689
last

178
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:43,969
and I'll get into this with our phones
and I

179
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,999
other things that at a later time no
talk but basically this building

180
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,399
you know continued on the were able to
provide service through

181
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,679
through fire and all that and actually
air quality was better in science

182
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,790
really interesting oh man this is a
building in New York City

183
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,639
'em which is massive

184
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:08,089
yeah

185
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:09,820
it doesn't it doesn't say

186
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,010
on here yeah very well maybe

187
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,040
im will continue on here so here's a

188
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,260
an early testing laboratory and

189
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,230
this speaks like innovation you know
just what they were doing there

190
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,880
there innovating the suffers changing
I'm

191
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,270
so these guys says: I'm

192
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,660
all had a different position within this
massive

193
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,910
growing organization so these guys I
think you're doing

194
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,240
back into use repeater tubes and

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,720
this is a review love a.m.

196
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,960
power this in San Francisco insists or
what it takes to power the system

197
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,420
and a.m. the the the way they design
power

198
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,760
it its a lot of it some other basic

199
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,520
principles behind in the telephone
system are

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,839
are so well planned out and and make so
much sense the the way they install

201
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,070
things it's very similar today sir

202
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,480
to keep going on this is a picture of
the introduction

203
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,490
love a his testing contact circuits

204
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,660
like early relay switching systems man
this is a step-by-step system

205
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,890
so I I was speaking what about the
culture

206
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,800
and how it it got so big that they
needed a

207
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,650
E social group the they started putting
out magazines and that's where a lot of

208
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,540
%uh the pictures they just showed you
came from pacific telephone magazine

209
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,189
and I am their I am

210
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,010
basically a lot of with the pain years
that is keep

211
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,589
the old magazines in a lot of the the
old material and that's where a lot of

212
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,160
what I'm showing you right now but
history has come from

213
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,770
and and thats part of the fellowship and
and their loyalty to the company they

214
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,650
preserve the history and and

215
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,910
and it's actually still available you
can find these things um

216
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,060
through the pain years and and what they
do

217
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,310
so these are a bunch of trainees and

218
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,570
you know you can imagine you're
expanding system like this unit you have

219
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,110
to hire

220
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,089
tons and tons of people to to run the
system and and so here we are with a

221
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,060
bunch of ladies

222
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,720
who have just been trained I think this
is this is again in Seattle

223
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,050
because I got the sort of I'm pacific
telephone which

224
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,070
are getting a second they also had

225
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,050
social stuff and this is the basketball
team

226
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,329
and and and this is a small example
there's a lot of examples of this

227
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:44,480
in in the Bell System love

228
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,670
people that were they would have
activities sport

229
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,579
arm the softball teams their rightful

230
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,890
rifle teens the them go fishing um

231
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,709
and this is where the plane year started
coming in is the

232
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:03,500
I in addition to retired people people
have been with the company for 21 years

233
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,730
its also people are active employees arm

234
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,709
and I want to emphasize that here
because it's getting

235
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,560
a much much bigger there they're doing
things as a party the company

236
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,709
so the Pioneers started they were
embracing

237
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,430
everybody who is involved so if you're
an active employees and yet sir for 21

238
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,890
years

239
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,990
and you're still working with the
company you're allowed to a

240
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,650
join in and become pain yourself while
you're working for the company

241
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,790
missus pacific telephone magazine cover
from 1922

242
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,390
arm in the magazine they start
publishing a lot of the activities in a

243
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:39,959
lot of stuff

244
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,029
around technology like what's changing
what's new

245
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,260
what is I'm you know what's what's going
on what events are going on although

246
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,819
all this stuff that was surrounding this
as I said socio industrial

247
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,720
I group these people that had built this
massive system

248
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,850
um and serve charting new territory in
the unknown

249
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,890
they were able to trade around have in
this is where I get into Lake parallels

250
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,930
between hacker

251
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,990
and play near they could talk about all
kinds of issues

252
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,779
I but be that tight-knit community

253
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,490
and so certain looking for some others
parallels and that's why I'm serve going

254
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,890
over the history itself under quickly
cuz I want to focus on the plane years

255
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,680
um and and the cohesion amongst them so

256
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,550
they would have these magazines and they
would I'm show events show different

257
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:27,920
like

258
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,280
you know special-interest things and
again they have articles about

259
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,410
technology and the business itself on
and there were other publications this

260
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,230
is just an example local to

261
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,220
to where I'm at in the northwest um

262
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,380
I put this in here this is out of 10
pacific telephone

263
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,470
issues and it was a.m. I think bernie
ass asses

264
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,170
a me on the radio show the other day
because he was

265
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,650
commenting on the the tell a photograph
and so these were shot so the telephone

266
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,420
a graph

267
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,740
and and they were published in and
basically people could read about it and

268
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,980
say oh you know this is the new stuff
the other people are doing in

269
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,709
it helps I innovation helps them
continue their own innovation or give

270
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:17,130
them ideas

271
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,380
they also talked about lettuce and

272
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,060
you know that's example if things that
are you know kinda unrelated but

273
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,069
in the community they would have
articles about like special-interest

274
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,140
stuff that

275
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,740
wasn't really related but but they tired
and they would it would be news

276
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,750
in their their social group arm

277
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,130
and of course vice president that's for
industry news

278
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm you some accident statistics from
1922

279
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,030
I'm actually this is 1926

280
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,600
so they're talking about 1925 um there's
also a lot of Lake Show stuff humor

281
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,630
liked levity to keep people engaged in
you know having fun and so this is a

282
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,410
the a sell advertising club there some
costume ball

283
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,560
so there's a lot of goofiness lotta
antics in the in the social

284
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,030
aspects I love how the people that
pioneered our telephone system

285
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,189
a how they interacted so this is just a
funny shot I want to

286
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,280
talk about on and this is

287
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,599
a meal card from one of the very first
I'd say about

288
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,620
the first decade love the telephone pain
your meetings this is a I'm

289
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,630
a printed menu card again

290
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,929
the the style Ising the design there's a
very is a very dignified job to work in

291
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:34,179
that

292
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:39,240
the telephone company arm you were doing
amazing things that everyone

293
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,500
dressed very very well I don't know a
lot of the plant guys they were out

294
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,900
working very hard but they all had you
know nice

295
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,610
felt hats and I mean the the guys in the
offices or the gals

296
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,679
a are women issues me the word running
switchboards are all in in very nice

297
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,679
full length dresses that kinda thing was
a very dignified job

298
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,340
so you see the is static in in some
other history

299
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,178
have like how how seriously they took
their role in and how

300
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm you know loyal they were to any I
don't know there was just a certain

301
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,149
culture that they created overtime

302
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:21,150
as they were building this this
institution

303
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,960
really

304
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,060
ok and another yeah I came here to learn
to I'm

305
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,389

and I really love the pen and ink I mean
this is beautiful stuff

325
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,090
to go through and and again it's the
pioneers that have preserved a lot of

326
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,040
this

327
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,070
um and I'll get to that

328
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,770
very shortly here a because I wanna talk
about locally like how I got involved in

329
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,440
and and my chap like the chapter in my
community the kinds of things they're

330
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,159
doing

331
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,570
because olive you can get involved with
with the pioneers are doing whether

332
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,139
you're in telecommunications

333
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:04,560
or not I they're very open and welcoming

334
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,428
anthem all stop there and continue the
history really

335
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,290
really trying to get through this is
kinda slow this is Miss Daisy Thomas

336
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,270
have organ first woman president

337
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,389
a pain your chapter into I really want
to emphasize on the ladies because

338
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:25,020
a they played a huge part in with the
pain years have done and what they've

339
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,129
bill and I think that makes a.m.

340
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,669
this company really really really unique
so

341
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:38,290
and I just wanted to and some historical
stuff the stuff I got cleaned out of

342
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,220
magazines

343
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,770
old magazines I with this because this
is

344
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,700
sorta foreshadowing for the future and
an where it's at now

345
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,760
home this is an advertisement on the
back above the

346
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,500
pacific telephone magazines

347
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,530
says Voice highways town yeah well

348
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,230
capetown county or state boundaries are
not boundaries are the telephone service

349
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,360
are not the boundaries and telephone
service

350
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,750
every bell telephone is the
long-distance station so

351
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,100
I do nine times and even

352
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,970
perfect that's good okay so this is an
article written in the

353
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,050
The Seattle Times arm about

354
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,250
the Museum of communications the museum
is a 50 once

355
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,270
c3 non-profit because at that rate

356
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,270
a ants it is a project

357
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,250
love the Telephone Pioneers America and
specifically

358
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,970
the the local chapter I think it's at
the time it was called Charles B Hopkins

359
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,169
chapter 30

360
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,560
the pain years and this is in Pacific
Northwest's territory

361
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,850
as formally Pacific Northwest Bell

362
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:56,620
so there's the article

363
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,350
and this is actually a picture above my
local

364
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,590
central office this is in Georgetown
Washington missus that to Amish central

365
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,408
office

366
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:12,050
and what happened is I ok a buncha guys
were

367
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,260
serve getting ready to retire and one of
them was a manager and they basically

368
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,700
were able to convince the telephone
company at the time

369
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,350
there they as the Telephone Pioneers

370
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:28,169
start a museum with extra space is being
created in the central office because

371
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:32,730
a lot of the telephone system was
getting smaller so they had more space

372
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,360
I and they were able to get the second
half a second

373
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,610
and all the third floor of this building

374
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,080
and the first for itself is a a working
central office

375
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,470
minutes from my quest right now which is

376
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:54,429
probably gonna change a thing about yet
but I am

377
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,380
so there you go museum

378
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,870
I am in this is early stuff this is the
first 10 years the plane years this is

379
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,880
the kinda stuff they did that fellowship
loyalty service

380
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,530
on the they're making Christmas toys yes

381
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,908
Christmas toy is a for needy children

382
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:15,520
from and they've done all kinds of
things as a lot of projects

383
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,668
I'm I think I think on the radio show
they mentioned

384
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:23,060
the audio baseballs for

385
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,290
unit no visually impaired I N A

386
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:32,820
also do books on tape for visually
impaired people as well

387
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,899
and I a myriad of other projects

388
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:40,620
so this is an early one and I'm
basically the last section last half I'm

389
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,490
gonna go through

390
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,220
as quickly as I can with him shots that
I did

391
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,290
in the museum to can it take you through
what the Pioneers have done

392
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:53,460
locally I to engage not only people in
Italian

393
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,760
telecommunications industry but just in
the community in general all kinds of

394
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,340
people go through this museum

395
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,040
so a metre pick up the pace here

396
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,620
this is an example that the Northwest I
am

397
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,950
workers digging open wire the snow

398
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,669
so again that regional I'm regional home

399
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:17,200
a need be became a necessity because so
many people were involved at the phone

400
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,919
system

401
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,600
that they had to arm basically they're
meeting similar to like hope conference

402
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,120
or

403
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,210
or something like like a are

404
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,510
you know that the regular yearly meeting
they had to split into General

405
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,460
Assembly's

406
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,889
and then from there they they split in
two chapters so again year

407
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:39,429
your telephone painters are are localize
all around the country

408
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,620
I'm not all of them have museum stuff

409
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,899
so that's a distinction

410
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:51,820
they have everything in this museum that
they basically preserved

411
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,629
a lot of history and in a lot of workers
that maybe aren't paying years so they

412
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,760
the you know didn't really stay active
with the pain is there they were

413
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,970
basically donate stuff

414
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,540
and that is how this museum is grown and
existed so there's

415
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,889
some Bell stationary there's a lot of
tools

416
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:15,000
and a workbench so this is the power
system

417
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,610
for the a.m the entire museum

418
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,450
from this is the teletype area

419
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,080
arm San Associated Press Start I

420
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,300
and this is a rare a.m. Siemens

421
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,860
I think it's a a.m. like a

422
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,260
would you say it like a generic brand
kind ever

423
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,040
a imitation farm some the other

424
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,520
brands obviously semen is not Western
Electric yeah

425
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,500
dip yeah

426
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,389
so this is what it looks like when you
walk in and the museum has

427
00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:57,580
every generation love switching
equipment and telephone

428
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,639
you can possibly imagine represented so

429
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:05,139
this is a a panel 'em

430
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:08,580
for the the Parkway office

431
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,928
seasonal panel switch

432
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:15,310
on this is the number one crossbar
that's their

433
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,389
this is where Bob works I I tend to help
in a little bit and this is

434
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:23,780
for the number-one crossbar believe

435
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,820
and there's a number five there as well
but this is the

436
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,899
the task board task are

437
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:36,250
switches on the car on Andy

438
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,790
who is he's 92 he's our oldest member

439
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,020
at the museum he's working on this north
electric

440
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,820
RCX 100 in this came out over a
battleship I believe

441
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,610
and he's trying to get to work and he
does all kinds of stuff

442
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,100
but again it it provides an opportunity
for him to relate with people that

443
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,560
are in the industry that they want to
talk to some of the older guys in

444
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,200
an in basically keep that bond keep the
fellowship alive

445
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I'm and so he's there every to say

446
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,870
this is a tone generator

447
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,510
makes a certain tone so yeah I'm

448
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,290
I helped the refurbished us a little bit
for the

449
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,950
the multi multi-frequency display and
what you find is that when they get old

450
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,990
equipment they basically want to set up
a display so that they can show kids

451
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,940
that they can show the community

452
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,879
all kinds of people people in phnom tech
industry

453
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:42,940
all way down to like your Cub Scout sir
you know of all kinds a group though

454
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,379
they'll come in

455
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:47,510
%um maybe guys that just you know work
on the truck they work with quests they

456
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,470
wanna come in and see such so this is
part of the display

457
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,060
this is another tone generator I don't
know which time this mix I can't

458
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,070
remember

459
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,658
it's pretty arm

460
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:04,590
this is an example the slightly more
advanced teletype system

461
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,060
and this is the 3 yes s

462
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,299
that's on the second floor slightly more
sophisticated than

463
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:15,639
again all of these generations are
represented their

464
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,159
that's the back a bit

465
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:26,159
and this is done by Stephen he works
with the tele types

466
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,370
a here a was involved with

467
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,610
STF da STF Lone Star

468
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:39,010
and their original 3b2 is is actually
here on display

469
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:45,629
and he do this insulation so there's an
example UNIX systems there

470
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,940
home manuals for that and

471
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,080
this gets into books there's there's a
lot of books

472
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,439
in a lot of things to read I office is
able to get magazines to help support

473
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,990
the brief history of outlined here the
server

474
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,610
crash course in it but there's a time
information

475
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,610
at the museum from

476
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,409
and its it's not the only information
there I

477
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:15,880
I want to emphasize the the Pioneers
themselves as repositories for a lot of

478
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,140
wisdom

479
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,740
on and that's part of why I got involved
I wanted a nurse and telephones I wanted

480
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,620
to

481
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,390
to help out a little bit um and

482
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:33,030
the welcoming the the way they were
being with me the the kind over

483
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,840
I do know that the instruction the the
attitude they had towards a young person

484
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,600
trying to understand things going to
help a little bit

485
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,940
um it really really was

486
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,710
pleasant in that maybe wanna come back
and help out more so

487
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,480
they're very eager to teach people and
again this museum that they've created

488
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,169
is

489
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,549
wonderful environment for that it's it's
excellent on

490
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:01,970
and so there's other museums around the
country but this is a very unique one

491
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,640
in a gem really from

492
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,059
years old all books and

493
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,190
really big books and this one's really
big

494
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,350
I am it's a storage

495
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,350
I don't know 6055 I don't know what's in
it

496
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,890
%uh but it's huge

497
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,120
from there's really tiny books this is a
microfiche

498
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,840
catalog and if you look closely it's
made by default

499
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,870
they're smart people phone books

500
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,890
to have a couple those interesting
stations and they have a

501
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,280
technical journals which are very
similar to like 2600

502
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,149
scenes that kinda thing except a little
exactly

503
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,700
exactly that's what I was thinking is
like route 26 hundreds very similar

504
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,880
and then again there's a lot of
parallels so um

505
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,340
and they've got a lot of these

506
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,370
really act I was wondering and I wanted
to the time so people can ask and and

507
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,010
and see

508
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,150
and likewise if I could find out like if
Somerset has been

509
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,320
scant causes a lot of information skits
until like BSP's

510
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,200
these are ones that bob and I will using
on the crossbar

511
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,770
and this is Frank I am

512
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,889
in the foreground and they're sitting in
front a.m.

513
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:31,250
his partner and him are sitting in front
of our the wall BSP's that are there

514
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,360
and he's working on I want those tape
decks I mentioned

515
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,080
about well for the

516
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,830
visually impaired which is again another
project and again

517
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,350
they've the created this museum to use
as a space

518
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,510
for teaching about what they do and
enrolling people in their organization

519
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,760
but also being a resource for the
community and

520
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,400
I'm and providing service

521
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,860
you know as and not service has an
telephones but like service likes being

522
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,770
a service organization

523
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,350
in their community where they spent
their entire career

524
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,730
this is kinda funny picture about the
vesture in stuff like that

525
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,900
so mmm

526
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,400
and this is the despair stuff they have
it's just

527
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,600
all this so wonderful equipment and a

528
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,659
I'd wanna mention that all the switches
work and that's kind of what

529
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:31,299
they're working on is Calif getting them
functioning at getting lines tied in

530
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:35,690
connecting them up I'm so they've got a
lot of spare parts for things

531
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:41,940
from says an exhibit on the types of
wire over the generations

532
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,929
home your wire older

533
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:49,240
and really new

534
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,080
and then quickly emina look at some cool
phones and then stop

535
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,270
and kinda wrap it up and let you guys
may be asking questions

536
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,240
in getting to

537
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,600
well this is a candlestick some ringers
I'm

538
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,140
this is an intercom this cliff like an
apartment system

539
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,240
vestibule telephone

540
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,740
this phone is to use

541
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,120
that's because this to prevent ignition
have hazardous atmospheres

542
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,340
oh that's the warning I but this is
basically for like in a minor someplace

543
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,770
that has a

544
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,070
fumes that could ignite I think that's
what this one is

545
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,299
innovators bomb proof but it looks bomb
proof

546
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:34,330
them and this is just a funny alarm

547
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,770
a and I put this in here too preface the
next photo

548
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,549
I which is really funny a

549
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:45,799
yes see entering the affair Welker's

550
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,270
yeah this one the is beyond shop repair

551
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,190
soon as a very melted model 500
telephone

552
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,409
and a

553
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:01,360
probably mention this on the show's on
the radio alarm

554
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,289
I went to dayton and I bought this old
phone right here

555
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:10,159
it's really compare the Bell and I
refurbished at museum

556
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,520
so a the guys were really nice I had
like all these pioneers

557
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,560
basically offering their help and we got
it all wired up

558
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,859
i mean they provided in New quayle
handset

559
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:25,029
accord and gave me you know 10 feet
above

560
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:28,750
shielded pair and its basically clean it
up in

561
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,149
I fixed other transmitter and receivers
I swapped in some parts in

562
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,009
this is a an example of just how cool
there they've they love to see someone

563
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,529
coming in with the project

564
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:41,659
you know like I said normally a walker
with bob in an HR like learn

565
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,500
a little bit more more every time I go
but if I have something that I'm doing

566
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,350
home

567
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,899
anything telephone related this is this
is the resources with

568
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,540
what they're there for the No how this
stuff works and how

569
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,560
you know how to explain it in like a
really approachable way in

570
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,970
and get you get you involved in some
other projects it's

571
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,609
it's very a.m. reciprocal serve

572
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:07,180
relationship so is part of the fun I
have their

573
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,480
and this is a punch card phone and
another example that

574
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,510
I am this my

575
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,589
it yeah yeah

576
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:21,870
exactly sorry going quickly

577
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:28,560
trying to save time here this a I don't
know exactly what this is for

578
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,630
is a okay

579
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,870
okay yet seal a lot of stuff I don't
even know

580
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,400
I'd took shots I thought would be
interesting you know

581
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,640
cool cool on this is a recent display
they put in a partner system

582
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,799
a but you know when they get equipment
if it works and stuff though

583
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:52,950
try to find a display for it so that
they can walk around with people in

584
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,290
show you know this an example this in
and you pick up one and Collin

585
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,460
and again you can hear the call quality
in try to understand you can actually

586
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,650
watch like how

587
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,339
how the switching systems working in
it's a great way to learn

588
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,609
what actually phone call is

589
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:12,250
this is like a business phone this is

590
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,359
pretty common in the eighties and
nineties

591
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:23,359
is that one is ISDN you

592
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,770
this is a a an early radio telephone and

593
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,940
these last couple shots are mobile
phones so

594
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:38,529
this is a super car phone

595
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,140
and has a

596
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:44,929
it has an off switch for the key which i
think we should put

597
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:49,130
in a modern handsets Sloan

598
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,759
some cool motorola's and and notice the

599
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:57,189
the the guide a with the telephone in
the steering wheel

600
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:03,589
it's kind of interesting no wonder with
those instructions are like

601
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:08,179
missus international mobile telephone
systems and it's a briefcase

602
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:14,569
phone sir funny-looking and this is
another one

603
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:21,569
pulsar so those are all the pictures
Abra

604
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:25,609
and from are we done on time

605
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:28,839
great okay

606
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:32,949
so that's everything I wanted to show I
just basically a

607
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:36,630
wanted to get a chance to speak and and
tell people about the telephone pain

608
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,119
years

609
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,939
I and with a pen for me in my community

610
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:45,689
and how I got involved I I stumbled on
their website and I started going on the

611
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:46,649
museum is open

612

I'd I'd suggest like flea markets a

634
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,980
a it depends on how old too because a
lot of the stuff was

635
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,310

638
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,080
is changing so quickly

639
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,170
people getting rid of it people have it

643
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,840
talking about anybody else have a
question

644
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:00,840
in at the

645
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:17,520
right

646
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,299
yes there's a lot of member Billy that's
why I

647
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:27,190
rush exactly they've got massive
soldering irons yeah I mean that they

648
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,029
were doing a lot of soldering is that's

649
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,760
that's how wire was bundled out or lines

650
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,930
a certain point and there's a ton a
memorabilia that's why I put in a

651
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,960
to rem serve Bell paper cuz there's so
many little trinkets and

652
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,279
souvenirs again you know they were on
our people for their service and you

653
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:45,819
would get

654
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:50,038
like you no apparent or buttons
europeans that not buttons but pins you

655
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,240
know to recognize an

656
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,490
share in that accomplishment have
loyalty to the company in

657
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:00,470
and building the system that they were
all sharing in so maybe one more

658
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,150
question

659
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:08,150
that's a good question

660
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,400
what kinda impacted the breakup have on
the pain years

661
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,400
the way I see it now it's some

662
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,150
its strengthen them in that they've
grown

663
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,059
they welcome anyone who's been a part of
the telecom industry

664
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:31,339
and arm as it stands now there's

665
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:35,500
lot of a lot of small companies a lot of
individuals that have started up

666
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,069
ants arm we see these these guys come in

667
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:42,558
you know maybe they started it the you
know some sort of

668
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,920
telephone telecom related company and
they will go through BSP's to

669
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,730
find you know information on how they
can make their systems better

670
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,109
on men even how they can compete better
which is kinda interesting

671
00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:01,240
so I think for the for the Pioneers it's
really good because its outreach

672
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,440
their again it's a socio industrial
organization so they're able to interact

673
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,549
they're able to to

674
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:12,089
have cohesion as people that are
involved in

675
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:16,359
in that kind of technology in I know if
that's a good answer for

676
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:19,400
thank you for coming and listening
