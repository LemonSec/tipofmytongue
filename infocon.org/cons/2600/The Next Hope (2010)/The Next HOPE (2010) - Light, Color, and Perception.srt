1
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:04,400
thank you everybody thanks for coming
I'm stoked to be here

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,960
arm are let's get started great place
for of

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,830
arm re: are light-colored perception
this can be a great talk to start I'll

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,730
the weekend with because got lots of
pretty colors and not too much

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,699
hexadecimal

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,810
kinda ease into the weekend re:

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,070
arm are start with

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,619
presentation with a quote from the Dalai
Lama

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,390
yeah I'm from California I'm I think

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,250
the Dalai Lama's is I is a heavy cat and
i think is kinda

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,329
a hacker cuz on he's talking about

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,930
learning system so you can hack it
properly

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,059
I'm so this is someone we talking about
today is kinda visual system your

14
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,489
perceptual system

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,809
and the physics between light and color
arm

16
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:54,610
I don't have any particular
qualifications to talk about this other

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,030
than a

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,770
fascinates me arm i've a PhD but not in
horribleness

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,989
for any this stuff arm are I do make and
sell

20
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,049
our summer these are little perceptual
hacks which

21
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,909
I tell people or is art and for some
reason that I think makes me your a

22
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:10,650
professional

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,950
okay so arm enough about me

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,470
let's talk about you okay specifically
what's inside your eyeball

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,140
and on the way you see the world is on
through these specific

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,689
a special I cells called rods and cones
in the back a few retin-a retin-a as the

27
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:28,790
back your eyeball

28
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,210
arm okay and yours kinda the structure
of things

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,250
arm see if I got a pointer here yes so

30
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,560
on this is the light comes in are from
your left here

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,740
and the sensors are actually behind all
the structure

32
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,409
up the arm wiring the plumbing or
something so if you ever need a hand the

33
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,850
argument for evolution

34
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,270
I you know if your gonna sign this thing
from scratch you probably

35
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,408
wanna put the sensors in front but the
wiring in the plumbing

36
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:58,189
arm so looks much like my fonts got
messed up

37
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,490
I'm so anyway there's there's two kinds
vom

38
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,899
a actually four times but two major
kinds of cells

39
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:09,318
I light sensor sells one is the raw

40
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,040
and those are basically brightness
they're not don't detect color

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,269
arm out there they're good they're the
ones that

42
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,610
all work when are you have night vision
when it's too dim to see color you know

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,660
when it's super dark

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,980
arm and the ones that I will be talking
most about how these things called cones

45
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,399
which are specific color sensors arm

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,550
I and their interactive there arm

47
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,560
a lot more precise the more acute arm I

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,620
if you know what the pho VA is that's
those park in the center aisle

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,319
your eye which is really the most arm a
sensitive in a queue

50
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,080
on okay so arm I have no idea if this is
gonna work

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,569
on this is a little our demonstration
arm

52
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,489
if you could I this may work better
closer you are to the screen

53
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,300
if you could start that red dot for a
couple seconds alright just try not to

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,220
move your eyes you know that's
impossible cuz your eyes move naturally

55
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,180
arm I apologize for people who can't see
the strain on

56
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,870
on and if you stare at that Red Dot with
out moving your eyes you might notice

57
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,739
something

58
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,629
that's happening that green circle
anybody noticing anything like maybe

59
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,049
it's

60
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,250
maybe it's going away right

61
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,650
right okay yes so so if this is working
for you I apologize if it isn't this is

62
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,069
called Troxler fading

63
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,120
basically what you're doing you're kinda
super saturating

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,319
the green detectors in your high and so
that will kind of disappear

65
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,720
nine ish or white background arm and is

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,769
if you look right middle that has
anybody seen afterimage

67
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,720
yeah okay what color was a gonna reddish
pinkish purplish something

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,769
alright okay we can explain all this
stuff from physics and physiology and

69
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,110
that's mostly what this talk is about
kinda

70
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,310
how your perceptual system works

71
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,950
and how colors work and on how things
get full

72
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,390
which is kinda cool alright so arm we
talked about the three kind of Khan

73
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,150
sensors

74
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,750
arm others are one that's our are

75
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,939
dedicated to blue and there's one kind
of green and then there's one which is

76
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:14,579
orange red and they're not precise and
can see there's a lot of overlap

77
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,940
but this is how you see colors okay

78
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,770
on and so you can see the entire visible
spectrum basically through these three

79
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,889
sensors which er

80
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,560
arm a sensible to these particular
wavelengths and

81
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,490
basically if you look at a particular
color it will give you a response

82
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,639
on these different sensors in a
different way which will give you

83
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,970
the sensation of color and we are refer
to collar

84
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,479
with these various names arm and I'll a

85
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,340
whose if you're into the physics so that
you can also talk about the wavelength

86
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,229
of the light

87
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,690
that produces the collar self are you
know its electromagnetic oscillations

88
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,009
and it has a vertical wavelength and
I'll 402 meters from violet 550 is green

89
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,199
that's more or less the sender other
visual

90
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,949
arm spectrum and goes infrared and I

91
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,009
if you're a ham you know it goes all the
way arm in

92
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,419
RF and then nom down in the RF and our

93
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,520
all the way up into arm gamma rays and
x-rays

94
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,159
and stuff like that but this is just one
tiny little fraction of the

95
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,039
electromagnetic spectrum that we can
actually see

96
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,599
on this some interesting stuff in it
turns out that the arm

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,210
are the lower bound I love the are

98
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,530
rod us our econ cells that detect blue

99
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,520
turns out not to be the contest cells
they can detect blue

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,909
further deeper blue into the ultraviolet

101
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,680
on then you can see in what's actually
happening is that the lands

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,020
and the cornea arm blocks out some about

103
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,280
arm ultraviolet so apparently people you
can get up

104
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
operation that replaces your lands if
you have cataracts

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,850
and when that happens you can see
apparently are ultraviolet

106
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,490
arm you'd see further into the purple
then then you could normally which i

107
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,690
think is kinda cool

108
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,830
so I love you maybe they'll be the next
thing for on hacking and body morning

109
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,229
you get

110
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,340
lead lens replacements alright

111
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,330
so arm you talk about kinda full
spectrum color

112
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,639
and Dom if you've ever us %uh I hope
you've done this experiment retake the

113
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,310
white light you put it into a on

114
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,370
a prism and you see the beautiful
rainbow group Tom

115
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,840
a and that's actually pretty thing
you've all seen the

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,949
video where the sky is crying about it
just cuz it's so awesome

117
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:31,009
I harm yet so it's awesome

118
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,860
exactly are so on this is the rainbow

119
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,860
and this house all the colors we can see
right

120
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,680
well turns out it doesn't okay there's
this kind of are pinkish purplish

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,759
aren't actively magenta and arm no

122
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,940
where does that come from that's not
actually in the spectrum this purple

123
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,789
color

124
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:52,419
and what that turns out to be that turns
out to be a mix blue red

125
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,099
a blue white and red light and you put
them together and you get this magenta

126
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,069
thing but it's not actually in the
spectrum there's no

127
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,590
are wavelength of light that house this
particular color

128
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,979
on which is kinda neat alright

129
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,979
away this all works is you can mix
colors

130
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,620
are new mix colors like just by adding
together just by shining

131
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,669
them on in this are shows how you can
get basically arm

132
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,000
the primary colors are are red green and
blue

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,630
if you mix those uncertain proportions
you can get every color of the spectrum

134
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,030
every color you can see

135
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,759
and this is very much related to the
fact we have these three color sense in

136
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,500
Kearns

137
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,020
com and if you make some all in the
right proportion you get white

138
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,508
so white is basically the sum total of
all the colors

139
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,919
arm are all mixed together art arm

140
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,389
and this is really handy thing that we
can generate all the scholars from three

141
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,580
arm a three basic primary colors cuz

142
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,318
that means we can make these nights
displays would make these mice

143
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,330
projectors

144
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,628
are these all computers we keep in our
pants now we can see

145
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,009
arm these are super nice colors are

146
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,240
by basically lighting up or darkening

147
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,849
these three little elements here's a on
LCD display

148
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,699
I I hope everyone is look closely at on
your computer screen you can see this

149
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,210
made up these little dots

150
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,720
is a red dot O Brien dropped a blue dot
and if you like those up in different

151
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,199
brightness as you get

152
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,729
a the arm perception of color

153
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,840
okay so this is the arm RGB color to you

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,710
and typically you can get any color you
want just by mixing

155
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,009
RG Mb and if you have allred

156
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:34,019
and no green no blue then you get read
if you mix

157
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:38,589
red and blue you get Magento like we
said if you mix blue in green gets I am

158
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,709
and this has basically the entire
rainbow

159
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:45,890
in here and even the colors that you
can't see aren't in the rainbow like

160
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,220
light magenta alright arm little

161
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,050
digression arm some love you garden some
you I hope for fans of this comic by

162
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,199
are randall Munroe on he did the collar
survey were basically

163
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,330
arm he put up a million different colors

164
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,230
arm %uh it is based on the web and ask
people to name what the caller was just

165
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,990
generate a color

166
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,019
random and said hey what do you call
this this song Collazo

167
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,220
if the color was something round here
most people call the green

168
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,019
you could see how it arm a

169
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,760
does from teal blue and the colors that
you might expect

170
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,279
arm a really are interesting thing

171
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,019
%uh because in the survey he took arm
other information like gender

172
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,550
he could figure out arm some interesting
gender differences and

173
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,149
these are the these are the arm a these
are the

174
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,250
color names that are disproportionally
used by women instead of man so these

175
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,700
are

176
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,760
these are color names that that are
women used a lot but man used very

177
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,450
rarely

178
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,660
okay arm so I just on maybe think for a
moment

179
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,399
are what a show you what the guy said
and I'm think for a moment guess what

180
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:01,399
the most popular color name is for a guy

181
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,259
okay

182
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,119
right right right okay this is
absolutely real data right

183
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:14,600
even the misspelling a number five
that's that that's that's how it was

184
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,939
typed and I liked of

185
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:19,129
so go team Y chromosome right burger
alright

186
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:24,139
hard okay so he has all the data if you
want to do these experiments yourself if

187
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,089
you're a sociologist or something I
think this is pretty fascinating

188
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,220
comstock

189
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,269
okay so worry arm okay so we're talking
about light

190
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,749
and you can add light just by shining
different colors of light but

191
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:41,019
not everything is light arm if you're
doing pretty things if you're an artist

192
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,419
if using colors a few using pigments

193
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:47,169
on I would you want to do is use
attractive colors

194
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:50,228
and on %uh the subtractive colors are
yellow

195
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:53,720
a magenta and cyan arm and basically

196
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,899
%uh the way those work is a basically
filter out

197
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,379
stuff from light so few take white and
you put it

198
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:04,009
through a yellow filter he basically
removes

199
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,559
arm beyond the blue so arm

200
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,799
a here's our he was kind of a

201
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,399
example camel responsible thats lies in
one place arm

202
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,989
but when you put it all together on you
can kind of make

203
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:22,419
this up this collar real

204
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:27,199
are many have that the primary I'll
colors white with a red green blue and

205
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:27,730
then there

206
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,399
these kind of complementary colors I'm
so yellow

207
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,419
is basically arm looks yellow

208
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:38,919
is red red plush green now this doesn't
sound right

209
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,399
if you're used to like crayola crayons
are you may

210
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,379
may remember something I go but it's
actually true in light

211
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,299
and Dom I if you %uh see some the LED
displays

212
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:54,199
which have red green and this kind
orangy yellow thing that's just made by

213
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,129
mixing the red in the green the LED

214
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:59,999
on so basically you can take white

215
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,459
and subtract a collar if you subtract
arm

216
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:06,649
are read from white you get this magenta

217
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:11,259
thing I'm sorry that's wrong if you
subtract green from like you get magenta

218
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:13,609
and that explains the green afterimage

219
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,809
okay arm are here's a here's an
interesting hack

220
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:21,319
that people did a designer did this is
wallpaper

221
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:25,238
that changes basically aspect depending
on what color you

222
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:29,019
eliminated with so they're basically
three pictures you're kind of on top of

223
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:29,730
each other

224
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,929
on printed in are a sigh and magenta and
yellow

225
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:38,149
and Dom are if you eliminate them

226
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:42,429
in different colors you get the to see
the different images for example

227
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,959
arm on the left there the bones are red

228
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,329
in the actual color the on bones are
inside hand soap

229
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,119
Scion is a complementary color read so
that's going to absorb the red

230
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,839
so that looks dark and everything else
looks bright so this is kinda nice hack

231
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,449
how you can get

232
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,259
three different arm are images

233
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,259
from the three different colors on

234
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:08,829
using reflection and I is a nice
demonstration

235
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,169
up the comp 100 colors okay so here's

236
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:15,809
arm another little arm a demonstration

237
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,868
are if you want to steer out that Red
Dot

238
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:22,850
the red star for a while and the longer
you stare at it the better this work so

239
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,309
I'm gonna

240
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,488
kill some time here and talk about this
OMF I

241
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:30,129
yeah I'm from California and you might
recognize the picture there arm

242
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:34,079
this is a another demonstration of
complementary cock

243
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,959
colors arm and I just give that a couple
more minutes

244
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,819
try not to move your eyes look out that
Red Dot if you can

245
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:46,299
and are now in a show that in a little
higher res

246
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:50,879
okay and you'll notice anybody see a
color image there for a minute

247
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,369
right it's not a color image is black
and white like

248
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:58,609
okay

249
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:02,389
so that's called the Spanish castle
effect and that's basically the same the

250
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,100
fact is a

251
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,629
as the arm as the talks are fading arm
when you

252
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,709
look hot on this particular on

253
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,909
orangy thing you kind of saturate arm
%uh

254
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:16,269
the the the reading Green receptors

255
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,970
Armin Jahr I and when you show it
basically this gray color

256
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,169
it then looks bluish so on

257
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,309
that's kinda need to factor alright arm

258
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,379
Casey okay

259
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:33,539
back to color spaces alright if you're
arm

260
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,899
if your computer programmer never work
with image processing

261
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,110
arm the color spaces are pretty natural
you can represent any color with this is

262
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,179
this trip with

263
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,589
up red green and blue right new view
given all red

264
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,569
arm a you make it reading things like
that

265
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:54,309
Armando if you're a mathematician can
think of this as kind this abstract

266
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,299
space it has three dimensions it has the
red dimension

267
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,789
has agreed to mention it has a blue
dimension so any particular color

268
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:05,499
is just a particular point in this space
and I you can give that a numerical

269
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:09,389
number arm and that describes colors
that's a nice way

270
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,999
to describe the color arm in an image
format

271
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:16,720
is just sooo numbers arm weekend there's
our

272
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,579
other ways to describe colors argues
operation value

273
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,980
IQ cite racin lightness in this way %uh
there's a number

274
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,860
which is an angle basically around this
cylinder which gives you the hue

275
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,409
arm which is basically the color arm

276
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,079
then there's a saturation which is how
much colored is if it's

277
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,309
unsaturated is pastel loves completely
under unsaturated its white

278
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:43,509
and the value is basically how bright it
is if it's a pure color

279
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,610
work that's black down here there's also
arm hue saturation lightness which is

280
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,399
kinda like this but slightly different

281
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,049
I won't go into it bore you to death on
okay so

282
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:56,939
on if you look at things that are fully
saturated

283
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,929
you can get some interesting the fax
like this and I apologize if your little

284
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,059
hung over Kansas

285
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:05,059
may harm a

286
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:08,949
this this is kinda that's the this kinda
pops and vibrates and stuff like that

287
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:09,239
I'm

288
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,449
told that if you're a designer are which
I'm not

289
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:15,279
you're not supposed to use stuff like
this and what this is is this is

290
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:15,909
basically

291
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,069
two colors that are fully bright but

292
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:22,100
there basically the arm they have arm

293
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,419
no are shade difference they're the same
tone

294
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,879
a brightness and your your visual system

295
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,409
uses edges arm to detect things and it
looks for changes in brightness now

296
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:33,909
these

297
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:38,110
colors are exactly the same bright
they're just different colors right so

298
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,779
your your visual system doesn't public
doesn't have much to grab onto and

299
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,319
soldiers kinda vibrates

300
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,939
I was looking for a better explanation
about I couldn't really find one so

301
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,599
on you have to do this on and there's
also some nice solutions out there this

302
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,399
is Japanese followed name I'm

303
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,029
kidogo who is just does the stunning
things and I know if you can see that

304
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,429
it's kinda moving

305
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:00,559
I was really looking for a good
explanation as to why this happens

306
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,889
because I'd love to explain it but I'm
not sure anybody really knows urs

307
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,220
all sorts of things going on in your
retin-a and in the lower

308
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,039
are port parts of the vision system your
brain

309
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,510
and Dom and going up all the way to our

310
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,839
visual centers okay

311
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,628
arm are couple more color space is this
is our one done by Edward months on this

312
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:23,250
is

313
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,299
this this was done I think in the first
part of the last century

314
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,690
I think nineteen thirties and forties
and I he actually

315
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,899
arm ask people to judge

316
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:37,159
different colors by giving them
different color swatches and say hey can

317
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,590
you tell the difference is this

318
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,260
and %uh so this is a perceptually base
color space and you'll notice that it's

319
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,460
not a full circle

320
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,190
it's the same kinda hugh and likeness
towards middle and saturation increases

321
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,129
for the outsider brightness

322
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:54,169
and it's not it's not fully populated
and this is basically

323
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:57,179
are for the same reason keeps jumping
ahead

324
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,220
on that I your yellow looks brighter
than blue just perceptually

325
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,799
just the way it does so you can get
these you get done can these bright

326
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,980
yellow on the

327
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,039
brightness axis which is away from the
center and

328
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,908
little less the Blues alright so here's
a nice gallery

329
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:16,090
color pickers if you've used on a

330
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,129
Photoshop or anything you're probably
familiar with these

331
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,350
and most these ways give you waste to
navigate things in the hughes operation

332
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,169
lightness think

333
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,500
alright on well I'm gonna talk about
this

334
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,379
color picker and this is kinda really
cool and it took me a while to

335
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,179
understand

336
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,389
exactly what was going on so I thought
I'd share with you because it's pretty

337
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:36,919
cool

338
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,940
as has has anybody seen this thing
before just

339
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,419
coming across right so psyched which is
weird kinda HH thing

340
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:47,909
and it's got this arm I got

341
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:53,190
on the outside of this at least one edge
a bit house these are numbers and these

342
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,270
once again these are the wavelengths
above the various colors or something

343
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,619
see I've read here

344
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,689
deep red arm I here's yellow green
though the colors your

345
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,899
only really approximate inside this
egg-shaped and down here to blue

346
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,450
480 and ford's for fifty okay so

347
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm the way this works arm this is kinda

348
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,770
a recipe forearm art making your own
colors if you want

349
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,619
if you have particular sources of colors
in you make some together

350
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:26,059
this particular chart will tell you what
kind of colors you're gonna wind up with

351
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:29,700
so on for instance if you have or are
red pixel

352
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,760
and a blue pixel you have some kinda are

353
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,230
say damage monitors something I and you
can only show

354
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,510
red and blue pixels then it turns out
that using this chart

355
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,720
you can tell what kind of colors you can
get out and the kinds of colors you can

356
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,399
get out

357
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:47,460
are everything that's on the line
between your to collar sources in which

358
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,440
case palm

359
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,639
your it's red and blue am furthermore

360
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:55,139
arm that's kinda proportional in that
arm a

361
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:59,500
if you have basically arm seventy
percent blue and 30 percent

362
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,570
red then you will wind up arm at this

363
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,070
point your which is kinda this bluish
purple and this

364
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,529
arm once again kinda illustrates how you
can mix red and blue to get this

365
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:14,720
non spectral color arm Magento which

366
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,830
doesn't have a corresponding thing and
on

367
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,629
so so this is the arm and this a

368
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:27,139
people who do research in color vision
people who build monitors

369
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:31,760
on people a like the society motion
picture and television engineers who

370
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,679
are really care about this stuff have
this thing called a-arm

371
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,480
are a gamut and this is basically if you
have a monitor

372
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,799
if you have a camera if you have sensors
if you have things detect

373
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,820
kind of colors on if I

374
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,270
if you have a monitor and the red pixels
this particular color in the green

375
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,059
project

376
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:53,830
pixels this particular green in the blue
pixels this particular blue

377
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,240
then you can show any color that's
inside this triangle

378
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,649
but you can't show any color that's
outside points keep

379
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:05,450
keeps advancing apologies for that so on
this is called the gamut

380
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,990
and this on really characterize as a
display device

381
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,299
in terms are the kinds of colors you can
actually get out of it

382
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,889
on and this is important for a lot of
people and its really interesting to

383
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:16,589
know that

384
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:19,649
there's this huge gamut the most things
can't display

385
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:23,799
there's a really saturated colors really
saturated greens and blues and reds

386
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,960
you're just not going to get outta Bay
on out if they are projector

387
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,940
on their are out there are some now some
displays which have the fourth color

388
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,109
like an amber thing which part instead
of a triangle give you the plotter

389
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:37,820
lateral

390
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,299
which gives you on more possible colors
that are that I

391
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,690
you can get out okay so

392
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,109
arm let's talk a little bit about arm
how they came up with this weird X shape

393
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:49,839
thing

394
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,339
arm and I apologize in it for a little
bit a Matthew I know it's kinda early

395
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,059
on k so how did they come up with this
thing will basically they

396
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:01,099
this was done back in the thirties and
the

397
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,700
did a pretty careful scientific
experiment they would show people

398
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,190
a fixed wavelength a pure color that
they got from someplace and they would

399
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,010
I give them basically three knobs to
adjust these three

400
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,859
arm colors a to mix in the red green and
blue

401
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:20,750
and get a particular value on for any
them for example if

402
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,179
if you saw orange I'm you probably makes
a lotta red wood with a green no blue

403
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,750
and you get a value for red green and
blue which corresponds

404
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,879
that watch okay arm

405
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:35,609
so then what they did is they take this
you basically are got this

406
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:39,980
disarm a these try stimulus by users are
called

407
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,700
and there's some weird stuff you're like
this is negative how do you get a

408
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,619
negative

409
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:46,679
white well it turns out what you do is
you just out a little bit to the

410
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,270
everything else and so you can take down
the Red Sea had some

411
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,339
an offset to the ball on the green that
gives you are

412
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,139
the equivalent of a negative red and you
aren't you basically

413
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:00,230
divide these things and you get these
two values here

414
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,770
are this is a two-dimensional plots and
the way it works is basically

415
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,908
on the X is basically how much red you
have X's read verses

416
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:10,990
blue and why his Green Versace blue if
both

417
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,760
X and wire small you have blue faxes
large

418
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
you have red on the flies are you have
dreams

419
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,779
so on this is kinda Abdullah the other
color spaces we were

420
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,270
also concerned with kind of are
brightness and darkness

421
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,500
a saturation and lightness on this we're
just taking

422
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,450
a slice for the color space we're not
worrying about how bright things artwork

423
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,389
assuming that that's on that's given
okay

424
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:39,859
so there's more good stuff in the CIT
chart

425
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,099
and if you look right in the center the
center is where the white stuff it's

426
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:45,899
basically where you mix all the colors
together in the center

427
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:49,039
you get white or if you mix kinda colors
that are

428
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,919
opposite colors you can also get white
and noms in the center that

429
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,289
arm is where all the arm

430
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:01,010
a was called the blackbody locus in this
is the blackbody radiation

431
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,158
if you take apiece wire neither a blow
torch is gonna

432
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,549
already heated up Potter with oxy
acetylene torch is gonna

433
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:12,580
glow white what thats called the the arm
the blackbody locus and that's kinda on

434
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,109
this

435
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:16,490
curve here in the center here you can
see these temperatures here

436
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,000
on think al when they're pretty hot but
those are in fact the temperatures

437
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,470
are the colors that you would get were
you keep an ideal black body to that

438
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,859
particular temperature

439
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:29,449
and there's arm I if you have a fancy
monitor you know you can play with the

440
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,399
color temperature

441
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,080
your modern that just basically makes a
lil blue were little redder just like

442
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,220
shifting the colors back and forth along
this location

443
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,570
arm and I if your photographer there's
something called

444
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,730
d50 which is kinda the prefer

445
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,609
white it's the arm it's the standard
white that you used to calibrate

446
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:52,000
arm of photographic equipment

447
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,929
and if you're an astronomer arm are
stars are pretty good black bodies in

448
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:56,359
May

449
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,168
the colors of stars depending on their
temperature also lines up on this

450
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:04,940
arm on this curve here and there's on
things called a light spectrum and then

451
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,869
there's arm

452
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:10,649
incandescent spectrum I which is a
little greater a little warmer

453
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:14,200
little less blew it okay so arm

454
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,089
this is the this is kinda whole
enchilada are with the gamut

455
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:21,119
and the colors and the arm spectrum

456
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,750
and the blackbody radiation so this is
this is interesting

457
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,450
really to me has kinda a map other color
perception system

458
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,779
alright so on how do you make colored
light what I can't go in all these just

459
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:38,119
because there's a million different ways
but lost summer super interesting

460
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,789
on you do filters you can do arm

461
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:45,010
die crow it features a lot of our stage

462
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,589
lights used I croak filters which is an
interference effect is not actually

463
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,339
pigment

464
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,799
on this optical refraction just like the
prism chine

465
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,379
why didn't do it on the fuhrer if your
glasses are sufficiently thick like mine

466
00:25:58,379 --> 00:25:58,849
are

467
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,010
you look at the corner out but you get
arm what's called dramatic

468
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,899
aberration use that as a spectroscope
you basically get a little prism

469
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,330
on our gas discharge tubes or talk about
those in a moment

470
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,408
arm fluorescent dyes and phosphorus arm

471
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:15,659
a different pigments which light up when
use apt on arm

472
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,609
LED's are if you like building stuff you
don't stop the party with nose on

473
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:23,649
is up beautiful spectrum LED's you can
get now

474
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:27,879
arm and pigments and reflection and
thinks that me

475
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:32,929
if you're artist on if are are if you're
into this is a wonderful cycle handprint

476
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:33,700
art work

477
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,109
which basically talks about the on color
characteristics have

478
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:40,970
all the incredible pigments that are out
there for artists know that been used

479
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,320
our live but the ground up arms stone
which make this

480
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,389
'em beautiful blue arm to

481
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:51,399
are just about anything else don't have
time to go into that fortunately for you

482
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:54,950
arm okay so arm

483
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,889
are something we you don't always notice
but is always the case is that

484
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:04,099
the light that you used to see things
with also has kinda what color tap

485
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:07,960
a collar on a associated with

486
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,159
and ideally white light is white and has
all the colors are more or less equally

487
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,460
are balance but thats quite often that's
not the case

488
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,849
com on the left your this is are the
specter mueve

489
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:24,770
a-arm up the incandescent bulb that is
not very hot so you can see it's got a

490
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,639
lot of stuff

491
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:28,710
in the arm in the red not much in the
blue

492
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,470
on this one supposed to be a light
that's closer to sunlight and so might

493
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,649
has a peak in the green and falls off a
little in the blue

494
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:39,159
and the Red arm once again these are the
wavelengths the light

495
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,270
that you've seen here arm

496
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,349
and Dom I'll are very common source a
white

497
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:53,000
is on up are fluorescent bulbs in there
aren't any in here

498
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,339
up but in the center over fluorescent
tube is basically a mercury vapor

499
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,520
discharge in this is

500
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,520
like a neon tube only sky mercury vapor
and he put a

501
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,530
a high voltage across it you get
electrical discharge

502
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,658
and Dom this is the spectrum ovett you
get these lines in this is

503
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:13,399
this is beautiful pure quantum physics
work basically these lines come from

504
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:17,309
arm energetic transitions you basically
are you getting Adam

505
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:20,980
you hit it with a yawn electron from the
discharge are some the

506
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,169
arm Adams in the arm how so

507
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,859
some the electrons in that Adam to what
to higher energy level they stay there

508
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:28,428
for a while

509
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:31,480
on the fall back down the release a
wavelength of light

510
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,409
and the wavelength of light in other
words the color of the light that they

511
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:35,210
release

512
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,889
is proportional to the energy distance
between that harm

513
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:42,829
up between those energy orbitals which
is really a function of the element

514
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,829
arm and so this is a neat way

515
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:48,829
not only to arm are

516
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:52,928
figure out what gases are here in a
particular to did you happen to be

517
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:53,720
stopping

518
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,069
with arm electricity but you can figure
out the

519
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:01,440
chemical our composition of things like
stars that are thousands of light-years

520
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,839
away just by looking at basically

521
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,629
on either absorption or emission lines
in the spectrum

522
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:13,780
arm so I different gases have different
emission lines as mercury vapor and this

523
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,359
has

524
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,939
are blue strong blue very strong blue
very strong green

525
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,119
very strong ultraviolet one you can see
that one but on that's why the use it in

526
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,040
knots russian troops because

527
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,329
for some troops have the mercury vapor
and they have a poss for the foster

528
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:28,700
absorbs UV

529
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,480
and agree radiates out has visible light
on years neon

530
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,869
me on house on lots read a little bit
agree not much blue

531
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:39,990
on you're probably familiar with this
arm are

532
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,179
for a while they were using mercury
vapor are lamps for street lights

533
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:47,040
because they're pretty efficient they
give you a lot alike but they don't have

534
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,579
a lot of reading them

535
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,579
so if you were how under mercury vapor
street lamp

536
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:54,899
and was a red card would be this weird
brownish color

537
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,359
which are with your brain would still
make kinda ready even though the you

538
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,520
were seeing actually very little red

539
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,908
on nowadays EU's on a low-pressure
sodium

540
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:07,540
its ok and the same thing low-pressure
sodium is very little blue so you see a

541
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,569
blue car

542
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:11,879
that some your honor our street lamp
looking a blue car and

543
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:15,490
think about what color is that that you
actually see because it's not

544
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,520
there's not a lot of blew it

545
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,299
okay so on the Civil War thing I did
just to contrast

546
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:27,168
a a mercury vapor just charged with some
me on things the really kind interesting

547
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:29,849
complementary colors

548
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:34,280
okay arm so yours would have news you
can use you can measure

549
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,928
arm how good whites are arm

550
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:43,780
to a basically give you the colors that
you want to see by the sink all the cRIO

551
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,559
the color rendering index

552
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:48,629
and Dom if you go a hardware store you
buy a light pole

553
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:52,339
now you buy was compact fluorescent
settle typically have this number on it

554
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:57,040
and he goes from 0 to 100 100 is perfect
color rendering index

555
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,470
that means it's just like sunlight arm
all the colors that

556
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,750
are you can see under this lamp are
going to be

557
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,500
arm license at reason things like that
and on different

558
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,669
kinds elimination have different color
rendering index is like God

559
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,220
this I stole from a website that's
trying to sell you

560
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,609
LED's and they say a look at the CR I is
much better than fluorescent lighting a

561
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:19,790
fluorescent lighting

562
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:25,520
arm basically you have are the blue from
mercury vapor discharging got this

563
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,540
orange are yellow from the phosphor

564
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,760
there's not a lot of red in fluorescent
lighting which means

565
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,919
Reds were kinda washed out what little
bit weak

566
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,530
have actually noticed on a lot of
supermarkets are using

567
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,129
a high pressure on gas discharge things
on

568
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:46,119
because our fish in and they have a
really good our color rendering

569
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,470
arm in the Reds you go to the produce
it's got a lot to read

570
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,280
lots agreeing on the produce section the
stuff just pops it looks beautiful

571
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,869
um so there's a lot of kinda via

572
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:00,520
a psychological things people use to

573
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,559
arm maybe influence your I

574
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:07,619
choice of your where this on this is
this is good stuff now

575
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,579
okay so how do you figure out this color
rendering index you know it's kinda hard

576
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:16,379
well arm this gets kinda hard just to
look at this and say we are well the

577
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:17,869
Reds look washed out but

578
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,520
which can actually characterize it know
you do this is you take the reference

579
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,540
are you take out a bunch of colors I
think they're sixteen standard colors

580
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,549
which they use

581
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:29,819
and you you eliminate the reference
colors with

582
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:34,210
unknown good white light source aka nice
halogen which has good color rendering

583
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,049
and then you arm illuminate the same
colors

584
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:41,418
with this with the source a white your
testing and then

585
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:45,960
you can figure out the colors that you
see on the arm CIHR

586
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,389
right those will wind up in a particular
place and so

587
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:52,690
you can tell the difference that they've
moved hopefully if you have good color

588
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,359
rendering

589
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,040
they won't move it all on the fwy about
color rendering they will move a little

590
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,619
bit

591
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:01,369
and so the actual number you get arm is
basically you take

592
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:04,649
the average up the distance they've
moved in this psalm

593
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,049
ICIC color space for the 16 colors

594
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:12,270
multiplied by 4.6 and subtracted from
hundreds that gives you a number

595
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:17,250
theoretically between zero on and 100%
of its really bad I think you can get

596
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,579
negative ones

597
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:23,270
okay arm so here's something that you
may have noticed if you bought

598
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,520
arm if you ever bought like one of those
cheap a

599
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,819
are LED arm flashlights

600
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:33,819
on the color rendering from those is not
very great in the reason that

601
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:37,399
that happens is on basically there's two
sources a white

602
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:40,619
in a white LED there's a very bright
blue LED

603
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,919
and then there's this yellow greenish
phosphor on

604
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,369
which the blue LED excites so you get
this yellow green plus blue there's not

605
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:49,700
a lot I rated

606
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,399
on and you can see what's going on here
in the chromaticity charge if I take

607
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,579
yellow-green

608
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:58,280
and I mix it with blue I do get the
stuff that's white

609
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,668
and it's a it's a pretty white white but
the color rendering is pretty lame cuz

610
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:03,369
was not

611
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:06,799
much read it so that explains why stuff
looks weird

612
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,849
under LED's and there's a lotta research
into new phosphors

613
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:16,049
that have more reading numb arm the same
thing for our compact fluorescent bulbs

614
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:19,309
a lot of the colors on those little
weird and that's basically just because

615
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,919
they don't have good foster's

616
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,078
alright arm okay so let's talk a little
bit more about perception

617
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,889
alright on out Wilson are I he's our
professor at MIT

618
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,220
on I he has this wonderful allusion and
you've probably seen the city haven't

619
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:40,289
look at the squares marked alien bee
right M clearly a wok star curtain be

620
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:44,919
right arm what the secret to this is is
exactly the same colors P

621
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,969
and that seems kind of counterintuitive
but there's the proof right there

622
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,369
and of on here I've even taken away
those

623
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:56,119
are aren't exactly perfectly half level
gray

624
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,440
scale so on I even when you're high is

625
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,539
is is detecting things correctly there's
a whole lot of higher level processing

626
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:04,690
going on

627
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,940
to make sense in the world and on car

628
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,960
the same things happens with color on
this is our

629
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,200
missile demonstrations actually
interactive thing on my website

630
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,400
arm a these two you can adjust

631
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,710
the colors I love the surrounding things
you can just the colors are the internal

632
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,630
boxes

633
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,650
I kinda just that these so they kinda
look the same

634
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,140
are I don't know how does an on
projector turns out

635
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,828
they're not the same so on the the
surrounding colors

636
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:36,770
can really influence your perception of
things

637
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,430
alright on Kate one more little

638
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,328
kinda neat thing I hope everybody has a
hasn't played with laser pointers

639
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:48,930
and arm they've seen the same called
laser speckle which is

640
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,190
on I apologize I don't have my dream is
realizing short

641
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,650
to you right here it's got this really
interesting on

642
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,890
green it's a fact that you see from
laser light

643
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,020
and that happens cuz laser light is
monochromatic it's got basically one

644
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,740
one wavelength and there's not a lot of
and what's so you get one pure color

645
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,319
on and not only that that's all lined up

646
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:15,288
and it's in phase which means the peaks
lineup for the peaks and troughs lineup

647
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:19,180
the troughs so what happens with the
laser speckle

648
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,470
his when you shine upon an irregular
surface and this is a regular on the

649
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,280
optical wavelength scale which is pretty
much anything

650
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,400
arm you get are constructive and
destructive interference so

651
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,250
sometimes the things will add up and the
waves will be on top of the ways and

652
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,450
sometimes Adam up in the weights will be
on top

653
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,510
the trial of some or cancel out so you
get the light and the dark

654
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,780
things and on if you ever see the same
couple things to notice

655
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,710
if your glasses take off your glasses
it's really interesting you'll still see

656
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,079
the spackle

657
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,750
no matter how bad your eyes are because
the spec what's happening on your

658
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,789
retin-a

659
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:56,690
not on the object itself on and another
thing to do

660
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,980
to notice on even if you're are eyesight
is good you move your head left

661
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,480
the a the the parents will move right
and vice versa

662
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,109
NASCAR's is happening again on your
right now alright arm

663
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,200
I'm who running out of time this is all
last

664
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,930
allusion here to ok I apologize once
again if you had on

665
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,390
we had a a entertain last night I wish I
had a good explanation for this but

666
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,308
there's all sorts of things you've seen

667
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:24,670
arm a as far as I limited colors

668
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,180
on this one obviously have some
frequency a fax

669
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,828
high spatial frequency low spatial
frequency on

670
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:35,180
if you google Archita ok I he's got a
page on

671
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,058
his side i think is a professor in Japan
he's got a lot of these things they're

672
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:40,339
kind of amazing

673
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:43,480
arm and I that's pretty much my talk

674
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,480
I have some precautions

675
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,960
okay i cant really see some you got a
question yes sir

676
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:14,119
are ya there's on ok sure %uh thank you

677
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,939
yeah the question was how can you tell
how good the colors are on your monitor

678
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:19,399
how saturated they are

679
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,369
arm yeah I think there's on I'm I'm not
an expert at this but there's a whole

680
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:27,689
industry offer graphics designer making
sure what you see on your

681
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:31,299
computer screen is the same stuff that
gets thats printed and there's something

682
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:31,670
called

683
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,880
color monkey I think M O N K E does

684
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,910
anybody heard this it gives you a little
device you can hold up to your screen

685
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,359
it's got a collar sensor on it

686
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,288
it does some saw for the run through the
colors in a black secured to rise your

687
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,339
particular display for how good it is

688
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:50,119
at rendering colors and then you can so
the color profile so basically

689
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,329
the colors that you see on your screen
how the same has the collars

690
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:56,920
you get from the arm chopper you send
your stuff to get printed

691
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,189
because

692
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:07,189
mister why do we perceive red is red
Blues blues greens green

693
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:11,368
I don't not some really interesting
philosophical to the discussion

694
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:18,369
I sir

695
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:41,250
who

696
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,160
that's right so the question is why do
why does a why is light additive in wire

697
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,980
pigments

698
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,910
subtractive right why the different okay

699
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:57,440
yeah that's actually not that

700
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,440
thats was at me a okay fire alarm

701
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,690
someone had someone out the fire alarm

702
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,350
alright a case under type try and talk
through this until their

703
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,450
his actual demonstration actual
emergency go back your

704
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:23,450
okay go right go

705
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,900
okay so um hi I was a little the lame
job explaining this but harm

706
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,670
subtractive colors basically um what
they do is they were moved go

707
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,120
wavelengths of light

708
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,640
so a yellow colour his actually removing
the blue

709
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,250
go the reason it looks yellows are
shining white on a hit staking out blue

710
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:50,230
and its leaving yellow which is a mix of
reading Greek

711
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,340
okay that

712
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:59,450
did that help at all %um the same thing
the Scion Scion removes red

713
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,610
grieving the beyond the blue and green

714
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,450
to science this is why when printing you
use the scholars which a subtractive

715
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,570
would remove things on if you mix arm

716
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,840
if you mix rating green payments

717
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,550
arm are if you mix them all together you
get this muddy brown color

718
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:24,550
go yes yes the the question is on here

719
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,980
a he's the sort about people who have a
fourth cone

720
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,980
these people are called tax or chrome
mats and so they can they can see

721
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,920
because theoretically arm further into
the ER visible spectrum

722
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,350
I've heard that too are I don't know
much about I don't

723
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,120
are apparently are these people tend to
be women just for

724
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,190
somewhat genetic reasons like most
red-green color blindness

725
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,280
tend to be men because that's on the Y
chromosome on I don't know much about it

726
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,380
but it's super cool

727
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,670
on I think %uh the the extra

728
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,140
pigment is arm humor is is in the

729
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,170
is in the yellow region so they can see
were saturated colors and different

730
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,590
pigments than that we would

731
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:15,590
the SIR any notes on color blindness
yeah I didn't get into that but

732
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:20,830
arm are a simple explanation for are
red-green colorblind this is that Tom

733
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,200
are a wanna be your sets are our
consoles

734
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,240
doesn't work right so so on

735
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,730
so the so the distinction between
reading Green is kinda lost naturally

736
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,440
common

737
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,680
are specifically with among men on there
are on there are other types of

738
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,770
colorblindness

739
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:44,560
arm a things like that are to my
knowledge once again

740
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,750
I'm I'm not a biologist I'm not my area
that somebody's butt %uh

741
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,110
both the the most on prominent case is

742
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:57,830
is that yes okay

743
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:04,830
said

744
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,310
alright right right okay arm

745
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,940
bodo the a blackbody spectrum on this is
the light you get when you heat

746
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,410
something arm and other sign just like
to use a black body because that doesn't

747
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,879
have any hope that's a perfect

748
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,900
arm radiator but you can do the same
thing if you take

749
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,860
a piece of iron heated with the torch
and it Tom

750
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:46,860
exit me see if I can find that a
actually can do this yourself at home

751
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,210
with the light ball panel light dimmer
arm if you are

752
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,580
yes so if you take a light pole

753
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,880
and you put it on a super low settings
so is just kinda

754
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,300
orangish and things the newbie you'll be
emitting light with the color

755
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,820
temperature that's down here

756
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:08,740
now as you cruise the power to the ball
but I'll get less and less read more

757
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,840
more white until

758
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,560
some someplace around daylight here on

759
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,930
and so here's an example this this is a

760
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:20,649
this was a white ball and now notice it
is giving you

761
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,190
a full spectrum it's giving you callers
what pretty much all wavelengths

762
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,680
what a lot of the wavelengths arm are a

763
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,759
are in the red spectrum and would like
bob's like bob really inefficient

764
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,400
most other output is actually in the
infrared so you're wasting all that

765
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,790
energy on infrared like that you can
even see so which is why the warm to the

766
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:40,320
touch

767
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:47,320
so yeah

768
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,060
yes

769
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:08,060
scat

770
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,630
pay no attention a little man bright.com
okay so long

771
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,849
yet while the the physics behind this is
that basically

772
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:26,260
anything you heat up this hot will give
you color that temperature the physicist

773
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,560
like to use is ideal black body thing

774
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,259
arm which I house is perfect property
which it arm

775
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,950
is adheres to the arm equations exactly
actually this is

776
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,359
this is Max Planck to solve the
ultraviolet catastrophe

777
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,940
by figuring all this out on this is
awesome quantum physics your

778
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:49,940
arm but this is the I'm sorry did I
answer the question yeah

779
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,080
right exactly

780
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,700
right

781
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,540
yeah there are slight differences i
think im practic spring practices

782
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,880
its it's not large only only if you're
doing like real super science to really

783
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,320
care

784
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:15,320
most things are pretty good black bodies
lesser yessir

785
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,290
mmm right on our color detection methods
are well there's

786
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,570
I I did talk about the a three types of
cones knots

787
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:39,410
that's that's a one year high on any
light sensor

788
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,049
on anything which will detect are like
you can use the color sensor by putting

789
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,550
a color filter in front of

790
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,280
arm are so are for example

791
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,650
this arm a this collar monkey thing

792
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,730
that you can put up against your screen
and detects

793
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,510
the colors a toxic putting out I'm
guessing I haven't taken one these apart

794
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,740
I'm guessing that has three

795
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,920
photo transistors are photodiodes with
three on filters on it probably harm

796
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,280
a red green and blue filter arm her just
like the

797
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,350
the sensors and the camera there CCD or
CMOS and they have

798
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,360
little filters on top of them which
filter out the red green and blue in

799
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,780
fact I think that was a

800
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,130
slide that I didn't get to mmm

801
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,560
soon find out again from the

802
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,810
years

803
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:35,340
years of his response from a particular
Kodak camera which shows you basically

804
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,650
arm other response to arts I am light

805
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,410
might magenta like yellow light and
Scion once again is just

806
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:46,540
the summer the green and blue so if you
look at the green

807
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,110
which is this green things and the blue
thing which is the dots

808
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:57,110
you something together you get the Scion
that answer the question

809
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:11,380
that's right that's right

810
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:18,339
right there's also scientific instrument
called on a spectrograph for use a

811
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:19,520
diffraction grating

812
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,300
and you are put whatever like you're
looking at it in you you very the

813
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,040
diffraction grating which basically

814
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,569
what you sweep across a spectrum then
can measure the arm

815
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:31,740
you measure the response any particular
wavelength exactly

816
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:38,740
answer question

817
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,510
are yes I do I'm forcing not all

818
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,220
what was this is my on it so I plunges
on

819
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:52,450
ok like okay

820
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,480
so I will held so the

821
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,300
question was what does the
spectrophotometer do for the non

822
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,310
spectral colors

823
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:03,620
on basically nothing on it will show you
exactly what the spectral

824
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,580
responses of your light but armed %uh
the non-smoker colors is kinda

825
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,240
perceptual for phenomena so if you're
seeing this nice magenta your

826
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,300
spectrophotometer

827
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:18,950
will show you what some blue much bread
quite

828
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,370
yes research you

829
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:27,839
yep those

830
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:34,840
riches sure

831
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:45,210
on the question was I can talk about UV
UV response and specifically damage to

832
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:45,770
the eye

833
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:49,509
on once again salute without a mic a
review expertise but

834
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,800
on a UV on his strongly arm

835
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,940
active you know I energy is proportional
H new

836
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,880
right that's a on that's a a small wave
lengths so that's got lots of energy as

837
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,130
you go on the spectrum so

838
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,480
arm I and ya ultraviolet are

839
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,290
spectrum at the Sun is damaging just go
out without sunblock for too long you

840
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,150
will find that out

841
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,810
on are one other ways ultraviolet
damages things

842
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,340
is by cross-linking arm if you've got a
polymer

843
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,760
like the arm the proteins in with your
lands

844
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,300
on the polymers long change molecule it
gets damaged by UV by cross-linking

845
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:25,960
basically

846
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,580
%uh long chains a resposta slide
together how these crosslinks which

847
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,240
kinda bind a mini get stiff

848
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,430
this is one reason that you lose your
ability to arm

849
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,640
accommodate when you get to be a certain
age on another thing is it it would

850
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,370
yellow

851
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,450
arm the the lands on notice wave you
take a piece a plastic

852
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,580
and you a new love leave it out for a
while

853
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:51,390
you some some some classics were yellow
on venice is a canister something photo

854
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,890
comes in probably explain that

855
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:56,190
phenomenal operan I can on I

856
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:00,520
you you know since everywhere like a few
go to a travel office and you see the

857
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,410
nice poster

858
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:05,029
that's been there for a while on it will
tend to fade towards

859
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:09,270
blue right the Hebrew the Reds will get
washed out in this is cuz

860
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,830
read in Siam absorbs pollutants orbs the

861
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:16,569
I'm shorter wavelengths which have more
energy and basically just destroys a

862
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,080
pigment so it's actually hard to make

863
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,960
a red pigment that his that house good
lot more jumpy

864
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,420
or it may be time for one more question

865
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,580
okay maybe 0 more questions are

866
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:35,580
thank you for your time thank you john

867
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,180
I'm couple announcements %uh

868
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,210
1 o'clock today to keep
