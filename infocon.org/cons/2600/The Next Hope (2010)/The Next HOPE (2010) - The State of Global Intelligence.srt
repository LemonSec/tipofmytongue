10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,229

11
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:39,699

21
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,380
Robert Steele

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,940
search

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,509
I I came back from self-imposed exile in
Guatemala

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,380
are we're on a good day you get a
volcano storm that the stories pictures

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,860
and

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,940
severe heads on the street on hi-eight

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,960
strobel every year thinking about what
to talk to you guys about

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,380
it's it's a deep honor for me to be part
of the hacking community not only here

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,970
but the Chaos Computer Club in Germany
in the Silicon Valley

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,220
hacker's group started by Stewart Brand
well I do wanna make a transition from

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,610
the previous speaker I was able to catch
most of what he talked about knows

32
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,810
absolutely enthralled

33
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,160
in the year two thousand I was the
keynote speaker on day two of the first

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,350
NSA

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,479
open conference in Las Vegas it you
can't find my remarks

36
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,830
that WWW dot O S S dot net

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,880
forward slash Vegas with a capital P

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,950
%uh and I took as make

39
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,410
starting point there as I take as my
starting point here

40
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,930
we spent the last 50 years fucking up
the TX

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,470
about time we start focusing on the I on

42
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,859
and I belief that you cannot

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,400
create the word brain unless you focus
on the init

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,180
and Peter Drucker God rest his soul
agrees with me in August 28

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,840
say sappy said precisely that we've
spent 50 years focusing on the T

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,540
we now need to focus on me mind so I'm
here to talk about the

47
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,640
II and I'm here to talk about hacking
humanity

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,830
which has been destroyed by our systems

49
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,250
so kill the pig go vacant a as a way of
saying that it takes 20 gallons of water

50
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,709
to grow tomato and put it on a plate in
front of you

51
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,069
takes five thousand gallons of water to
put a pound of beef on a table in front

52
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:11,720
okay much as I love beef it's time that
we the people got in touch

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,019
with reality this is my new book

54
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,739
and I don't pick up my books all of my
books for free online

55
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,489
on and tough I paid IO to is the easiest
way to find them

56
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,780
but if you do treasure boxes I do the
hard copy really is fun

57
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,900
and I will be selling some of my old
inventory to pay for my trip back to

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,680
Guatemala

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,690
downstairs I'll be signing the books

60
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,040
anybody who buys both books

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,660
gets a free membership card 5800 to
which is the

62
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,130
global honor society for intelligent
people and

63
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,840
you're a lot a medically members now
this is the breaker

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,230
this is the precursor book and

65
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,799
it has 55 authors including ok I think
we're

66
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,090
and Tom atlee Thomas Malone from MIT in
the former Prime Minister of Canada

67
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,810
Paul Martin arm the government is now so
dysfunctional

68
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,480
bit any group of 10 average people can
do better

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,120
%uh and that's part of what I'm here to
talk about

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,239
now these are some mom

71
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,360
just some mind teasers die I gave the

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,940
the closing key tone at Amazon and
unfortunately they

73
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,870
refused to listen to me that everyone in
the audience loved it but

74
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,680
Jeff B cells was in a spaceship in
couldn't hear on

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,440
and then you've got brain and Gnome
which was my open everything

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,599
at the gnome 2.x hackers which is why
talk about the globalization of

77
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:43,490
intelligence

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,840
open was so my speech here unicef

79
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,880
and then pieces just kind of a general
catch-all for all the stuff from working

80
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,190
on

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,570
and Phi Beta Phi iota dunn et is free

82
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,110
on so this is what I want to talk about
very quickly very briefly

83
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,860
kak humanity challenge part 1-

84
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,080
the US government is

85
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,270
the source water

86
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,229
for corruption worldwide what the US
government does

87
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:19,099
in our name with our dollars is the root

88
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,710
of corruption worldwide and sadly

89
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,979
we have lost touch with our tax dollars

90
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:32,270
and sadly our tax dollars an hour spent
on the basis of who pays the most

91
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,549
the congressman for what they will
receive from our tax dollars

92
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,860
so ending corruption is basically about

93
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,590
accountability and transparency and I'll
talk about that very briefly

94
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,560
hacking humanity part true is educating
the poor oneself call it a top

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,080
can create infinite wealth one other
ways I keep saying this by reading

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,070
non-fiction on the number one Amazon
reviewer for nonfiction that's

97
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,200
completely an accident on

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,690
but it's fun and if you just dig into
the books that I've reviewed you've got

99
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,870
basically the cliff

100
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,620
the CliffsNotes for saving the planet on

101
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,900
not that anyone really wants to save the
planet but to up but we're trying

102
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,099
these are the

103
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:21,409
a tribe's if you will every single one
of them

104
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:25,539
guilty love abysmal failure on our
behalf

105
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,800
the government doesn't cover the
military doesn't defend

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,770
law enforcement doesn't protect academia
doesn't teach

107
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,330
business dozen enrich media doesn't
inform

108
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,990
the Red Cross steals eighty percent of
the money that we give their

109
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,380
in haiti they manage to achieve a2
percent throughput rate

110
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:52,380
on and and civil society is where some
of the good can be found the researcher

111
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,599
depictions

112
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,599
love real where politics the your first

113
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,660
comes from mom Michael Crain the
political junkie

114
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,660
can book although I guess that up a
little bit on

115
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,389
and the second is from my friend poll
rate

116
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,460
who is a brilliant man other than his
blade

117
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,060
love and love affair with Obama me he
still in denial

118
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,430
on we're all screwed up

119
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,970
we screwed up because of what's called
information asymmetry is

120
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,580
we're screwed up because we've lost
touch with how r dollars are spent

121
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,359
we provide a huge bountiful thing and I
will never be president but if I ever

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,530
have an honest president that will
listen to me I'm

123
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:49,370
and income tax on and it's a to Tobin
tax

124
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,500
but the money that we give to the
government vanishes into the federal

125
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,759
reserve a central banking system and so
on where become someone else's reserved

126
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,539
for what Michael Lewis called liars
poker

127
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:04,240
Goldman Sachs is still playing liars
poker and I am

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,610
absolutely astounded that america did
not burn tires in the streets

129
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,879
when Obama became John McCain in
blackface

130
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,449
and or push in blackface and it
basically

131
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:22,180
bailed out all these assholes okay ten
million dollar bonuses the day after

132
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,050
I'm sorry but that's a good time to
start thinking about vigilante justice

133
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,699
on and so we also have a bureaucratic

134
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:36,890
wakes so what I'm trying to show you
here is my non-violent revolutionary

135
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,568
paradigm

136
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:43,010
what it boils down to is out the
assholes with information

137
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,740
okay we've got to get a grip on the
information on our money

138
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,640
at every step of the way through
legislation through bureaucratic waste

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,750
through corporate

140
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,850
profit what are the reasons
PricewaterhouseCoopers found that 50

141
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,910
percent of every health dollar is waste

142
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,449
is because there is profit in waste when
you're doing cost-plus contracts

143
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:10,240
we've got to take the profit out of
basic human services

144
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,810
now these are for reforms I've been
talking about for a long time and I have

145
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,230
to tell your

146
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,530
Ron Paul ralph nader century McKinney I
love them but they're all part of what's

147
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,850
called the controlled opposition

148
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,660
they're there to give you hope they're
not there to actually change the system

149
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,880
their fear like Obama is theater

150
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,439
and Bush before him was theater the
world is run out of the secretary of the

151
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:38,010
treasury and Goldman Sachs

152
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,069
and the Federal Reserve which is neither
federal nor

153
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:45,910
a reserve for alright it's time we got
serious here about what's being done to

154
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,449
this country because he is being it's
all over the fucking cliff in 10 feet

155
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:50,719
from the bottom

156
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,890
on now the school reforms a common-sense
reforms

157
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,459
and what are the problems that I find
with Ron Paul

158
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,870
and ralph nader and Cynthia McKinney and
others is they don't play well with

159
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,510
others

160
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,730
they simply refuse to do the obvious
thing which is come together and say it

161
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,630
will Bama

162
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,939
unless you want the white house burned
down again you will pass electoral

163
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:12,800
reform

164
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,470
that will bring one hundred percent of
the voters in and that will allow

165
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,880
anybody from any party now access

166
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,280
Colo for this is this is not rocket
science so if it's not happening it's

167
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,480
not because Obama stupid

168
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,449
it's because Obama sold his soul to the
devil whose name brzezinski

169
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:33,930
when he was at columbia okay

170
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,790
they have been playing Obama to this day

171
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,620
any presents key snowfall he's got one
son and the McCain camp in one sign in

172
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,620
the Obama camp in there pulling all the
strings and

173
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,380
it is really frightening to me how inert

174
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,569
the American public is about all of
these so these four common sense reforms

175
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,060
are online

176
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,550
basically we're spending $75 billion
dollars a year for which generals any

177
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,030
says

178
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,310
is at best four percent but what the
president needs to know

179
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,730
and I love that 70 to 75 percent is
spent on contractors

180
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,929
who basically provide butts in seats
which is code for dumbass americans with

181
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:14,260
clerics is

182
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,410
who sit in front of the internet to
search for

183
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,280
they all speak on 183 languages are you
speak their own language completely

184
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,370
okay but they can be clear

185
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,860
because they never left West Virginia
okay

186
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,089
well maybe West Virginia can be cleared
anymore but Arizona

187
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,189
or whatever alright national security

188
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:39,670
we have a heavy metal military that is
useless for ninety-nine point nine

189
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,920
percent of what we need to do

190
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,319
because we're not using an
intelligence-driven military pockets is

191
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,000
a fraud

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,600
buckets is a wonderful intelligent man
he is a fraud

193
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,160
the last meeting he held with Lockheed
was to assure them that he would keep

194
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,660
their revenues going

195
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,900
it wasn't about reforming acquisition it
wasn't about creating a multi-national

196
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,600
civil affairs Brigade

197
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,689
it wasn't about anything other than
keeping the money flowing into systems

198
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,360
that do not work

199
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,600
the a-ten is the last airplane built by
the pentagon that actually works as

200
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
advertised

201
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,540
okay that's pretty scary

202
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,880
and then of course governance reform how
hard would it be for Ron Paul and ralph

203
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,260
nader

204
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,089
cynthia mckinney to come together and
say let's form a coalition sunshine

205
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,360
cabinet

206
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,410
actually sat down with a with some folks
got killed work for clinton

207
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,689
Michael could I hate work for goldwater
we came up with a coalition count a

208
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:41,549
cabinet

209
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:45,429
that started with kim hightower
agriculture and we basically

210
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,049
fill the entire cabinet with the best
available people regardless a partisan

211
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:50,260
ideology

212
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,429
and we came up with very simplified
policies which include

213
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:56,679
don't use water you don't have to grow
grain you can eat

214
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,020
to run a god damn car that should have
been built the first place

215
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,079
okay this is holistic thinking not done
in Washington or New York

216
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,900
except for the people in this room I'm
gonna pan if you shamelessly because I

217
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,929
gotta tell you this is the only time
every year I have fun

218
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:17,990
%uh

219
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,030
so electoral reform is fundamental there
is nothing wrong with this country that

220
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,760
could not be fixed by restoring the
constitution and implementing electoral

221
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,860
reform

222
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,459
and I I personally believe

223
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:36,000
that we should demand in time for 2010
because the last thing we need

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,339
is to change out democrats republicans

225
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,370
Whataburger two ways both crooks

226
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,240
okay so every state that is not allowing

227
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,870
independent switchover forty-three
percent of the up the self-defined

228
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,209
electric are y'all know that Obama was
elected by 30 percent

229
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,500
I'll be eligible voters rare 56.4
percent voted

230
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,490
the restaurant down %uh the 56.4 percent
he got a fair margin help significantly

231
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,559
but a $750 million dollars he promised
McCain he would never take

232
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,010
$300 million of which have never been
accounted for

233
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,890
okay the man is a crock he is dishonest
and

234
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,890
and hypocritical and while I'm at it let
me say that I love and jokes

235
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,620
he's the real deal okay between Van
Johnson Obama

236
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,640
it's a no brainer Van Jones every time

237
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,880
okay on so that's the end of my rant on
reform

238
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,780
but the bottom line here is there's
nothing wrong with this country that

239
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,809
cannot be fixed by putting the people
back in charge over

240
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:44,579
now this is something I created very
recently intending to show

241
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,799
the credit to over national intelligence
community

242
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,390
which by the way has completely disowned
me on

243
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,809
I don't know why over

244
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,949
I mean my books are always laudatory
about what they do with the money from

245
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:00,949
the taxpayer

246
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:05,569
on but here is a very serious light
basically right now the intelligence

247
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:10,410
community is doing stuff that helps at
best 10 percent of humanity

248
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,469
okay which is basically the people that
are getting rich

249
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,669
of love our support for 42 of the 44
dictators

250
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:23,030
on are waging war in Afghanistan is not
about us its not about winning works out

251
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,309
about helping the Afghans it's about

252
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:29,750
beating the Chinese to some minerals now
the Chinese a lot smarter than us they

253
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,400
figured out that if they build roads and
railways

254
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,799
from China to those minerals they'll
probably end out ahead

255
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:43,240
billow you know I mean I it's amazing to
me that people sit there and listen to

256
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,000
and I have to say I'm not against the
bomber any these people

257
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,579
except for the fact that they've sold
out and they basically talking share

258
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:56,510
to the public and CNN and Fox News are
no different their shit once removed

259
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,809
okay so we have a real problem here

260
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:05,329
arm this server this book which is i say
is free online by the way you have to

261
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:07,939
read it online to help local links be
active

262
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:11,099
haven't figured out how to make an
active here yet but

263
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,530
I love hard books there's a hand eye
coordination thing

264
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,500
there there is an intellectual process
that happens when you were touching a

265
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,640
book and turning the pages and I may be
the last generation

266
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,819
that thinks that my three boys think I'm
an idiot

267
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,270
up but I really believe in book so I
will be selling these at cost down

268
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,689
stairs with Wiley which is a very
intelligent company

269
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:37,939
I didn't know this but they also publish
the first book on hackers 2000

270
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:41,089
600 and I gave at a rave review on
Amazon

271
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:44,209
and now they have the letters
unfortunately there an industrial your

272
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,660
organization

273
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,929
and so somehow they didn't figure out
that the books needed to be here today

274
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:54,189
so they'll be here tomorrow %uh so what
I'm gonna do today is

275
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:57,819
is basically selling sign books and tell
everybody who comes to buy one of my

276
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:00,720
books they need to come back and buy
this new book tomorrow

277
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,679
up because it's a it's a priceless
collectors item these two books together

278
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,880
are absolutely phenomenal so this in a
nutshell

279
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,870
is basic strategy start with reality

280
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,400
we don't do that on apply open
everything with integrity

281
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,380
devise and implement long-term integrate
faith and values he's really matter

282
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,640
be accountable to all because the
collective aggregate intelligence of all

283
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,230
this

284
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,710
really is superior to what some god damn
lobbyist is putting in front of a moron

285
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,890
congressman

286
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,830
are apply the golden rule you know I'm
in Guatemala where

287
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,220
their solution to any problem is to
basically machine-gun the opposition

288
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,809
on level 4 K

289
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:46,490
the reality is can't machine-gun
cockroaches

290
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,750
it doesn't work the cockroaches in the
fire

291
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,030
answer whatever you want to call the
swarm it's coming at you

292
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,950
cannot be machine-gunned to stop

293
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,419
so we gotta figure out something else in
obviously looks like I'm comparable

294
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,630
world in the 50-year won't have have all
influenced my thinking

295
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,770
and by the way this brief will be up but
tonight at Phi Beta Phi iota

296
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,350
on and it states they didn't ask me

297
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,500
4 copy but I do have a copy on a stick
if someone wants to trust my stick

298
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,630
arm out stick it in their computer taken

299
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,320
take this brief which has notes but I'm
an idiot so I haven't figured out how to

300
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,960
show notes on the screen

301
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,179
the slide over there so on winging it on

302
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,410
this is a basic common sense matrix

303
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,240
nobody should be allowed to run for
office until they can explain this

304
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,330
matrix

305
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,870
okay the united nations which is never
going to be a world government

306
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,559
but which I respect as a potential thing
of talk about

307
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,889
on the United Nations high-level threat
panel which had brent scowcroft the last

308
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,280
adult in washington

309
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,730
as the US member came up with this and
these are 10 high-level threats to

310
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,230
humanity

311
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,850
prioritized by this high-level threat
panel

312
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,880
well I am 25 others created your
intelligence network as about to sell my

313
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,250
company for ten million

314
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,309
January 2008 in then shit happens

315
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,299
but my plan was to get my wife if the
money and put the other half into the

316
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,710
nonprofit spend the rest of my life

317
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,650
trying to basically answer this matrix
for everybody at every level

318
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,570
but we identify 12-core policies from
agriculture through water

319
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,240
these policies have to be harmonized I
mean we have cited the Department of

320
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,169
Agriculture that are paying to eradicate
Gophers on the same piece a land where

321
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:39,309
another side at the

322
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,210
Department of Agriculture's painter
nurture the Gophers

323
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,539
and if you look at the food chart with
healthy foods

324
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,039
and you look at the subsidies that we
pay for agriculture meat industry's

325
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,870
there and forget

326
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,379
okay basically your dollars are being
used to subsidize everything that's bad

327
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:59,070
for you

328
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,879
okay this is nuts IMEI just I don't get
it n actually I do get a

329
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:08,500
in and the bottom line is we're animals
were expendable

330
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,419
fodder okay and until we decide to start
acting like adults who actually run the

331
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,250
country

332
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,909
%uh we're going to be treated as
expendable far

333
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:22,409
now you're US government is spending $75
billion dollars a year on secret

334
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,590
intelligence it does not work in their
spending

335
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,820
over 750 billion dollars and heavy metal
military that does not work

336
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,668
all your money is going into red these
two circles

337
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:39,259
because that's where the contractors
make their money I did the first study

338
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,549
on Somali piracy in 2005 for the Central
Command j2

339
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,129
and nobody did anything in a couple
years later I S US Navy irregular

340
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:50,830
warfare in US Special Operations Command
were helped create the open source and I

341
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,610
said

342
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,620
why didn't anybody do are anything on
Somali piracy and their answer was

343
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,350
virtually identical

344
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,750
it's not that expensive enough problem

345
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,750
no shit a K I mean I would have

346
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,940
I would have seaborn snipers you know i
mean the seals love to sit out at sea

347
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,110
and pope in the ocean and kill thinks

348
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,809
honor so I would just drop seals a
little submersibles that are picking up

349
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:19,850
you know on

350
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,500
these church can I am bang you're dead
don't get it eventually

351
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,929
make arm just astonishing known this one
quick point by the way nothing the USA

352
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,129
does is gonna matter got damn for the
future

353
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:37,100
on lax we help these other major
demographic players

354
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,440
figure out that they cannot make our
mistakes

355
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,179
which they're making right now big time
okay these are the people who are going

356
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,230
to decide the future the planet it's not
going to be

357
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,570
us our financial industry is

358
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,620
busy setting up its fallback positions
in Dubai in Switzerland

359
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,409
because they're anticipating the day one
locus week to Connecticut burning down

360
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:00,610
houses

361
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,509
okay no I don't want that I hope that
never happens

362
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:09,769
but there is going to come a day when
people get angry enough to

363
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:13,129
burned down somebody's mansions in
Connecticut where we were paying $10

364
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:14,830
million dollar bonuses

365
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,000
idiots that we're playing Russian
roulette with our money

366
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,740
okay soul I'm very much in favor of
non-violent reconciliation

367
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:30,740
but when I die there's no holding
everybody back

368
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:35,789
now this is a way of looking at all of
these threats and I gotta say Robert arc

369
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:36,309
of

370
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,129
for is really impressed me what are the
things that are cost likes to say

371
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:44,289
is that what's good for one part of the
system is probably very bad for all the

372
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,090
other parts of the system

373
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,889
okay Canada for example is using oil is
using water

374
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:55,059
they don't have fresh water they don't
have to flush bolt are from the Saints

375
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:58,100
this is as close the government ABC's we
get

376
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,159
okay that's not too smart on

377
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,809
so this is a way of looking at all 10
threats and all 12 policies and you

378
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,809
can't put anything in the middle you
could put corruption in the middle

379
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,840
one other things and getting very
interested in is corruption in the water

380
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,689
cycle

381
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,149
its huge arm you can also put water in
there

382
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:22,029
on now this is a slight jay-z are you
here

383
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:26,240
manana J was that jay-z saying he's here

384
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,600
can make your recoverable okay JC

385
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,720
lisko its back there is responsible for
this slide

386
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,759
he'll give it to you later on but then
reconfigure got work he's got this

387
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,679
phenomenal he did eight years research
on the true cost of a single white

388
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,419
cotton t-shirt

389
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:47,570
and I can't tell you how respectful I am

390
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:52,220
up his brain he's also the executive
director for intelligence network while

391
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,570
we wait to see if the economy survives

392
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,049
on meanwhile I had to leave the country
to get a job in Guatemala

393
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:05,950
on but jay-z looked at the true cost in
terms of water and toxins and everything

394
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,519
and it's just absolutely phenomenal
surgery to go to reconfigure got or

395
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,679
or to school for true cost t-shirt on
you really get an eye-opener

396
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,009
on that now this is a quick side

397
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:24,110
on how easy it would be to do
participatory budgeting across all

398
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,759
partisan lines

399
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,980
and all the sites will be online tonight

400
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,190
there is no reason why we can't create
my budget

401
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,279
at every level from zip code two
municipality

402
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,429
to state to whatever and then what you
do is you aggregate the my budgets

403
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:46,590
along party lines if that's what you
choose to or demographic

404
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,100
age lines whatever and then you have a
deliberative dialogue

405
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,799
there's a lot of great work that's been
done by Harrison on who invented open

406
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,279
space technology by Peggy pole man who
has a new book out

407
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:03,759
time and Lee deliberative dialogue is a
happening thing

408
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,320
everywhere except in the state capitals
and Washington DC

409
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,200
and people figured out that they really
do have groundswell here comes everybody

410
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,029
army of Davids

411
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,629
the what's at wiki one week in omics

412
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:21,879
okay the bottom line is we're now
getting to the point where we understand

413
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:22,700
that humanity

414
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,759
in the aggregate can solve any problem I
love the Linux guys for San

415
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,809
put enough eyeballs on it nobody is
invisible

416
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,639
well I say put enough I'll balls on it
no corrupt assholes invisible

417
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:37,570
okay so there's no reason why you can't
do that

418
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,658
now this is a global range of gifts
targeted

419
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:44,279
and the bottom line here is we have to
get rid of the intermediaries

420
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:48,710
I am ashamed of the United States
government and its

421
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,960
intellectual and moral decrepitude with
respect to high 80

422
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,779
I mean on day one in Haiti I called for
peace jumpers who would jump in its

423
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:01,100
start entering needs I call for air
dropping water and food

424
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,860
I called for breaking down big air
shipments and six regional airports and

425
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,429
breaking down bitch

426
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,499
shit shipments at guantanamo a couple
other places

427
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:14,559
and then moving landing craft all around
haiti which has six ports and six

428
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,678
airports SOUTHCOM

429
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,749
was only able to figure out one airport
one port

430
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:21,919
okay SOUTHCOM blew it big time

431
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,769
I'm ashamed of them on they have some
very good people but they lost their

432
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:27,480
minds

433
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,929
with respect to Haiti you put 20,000
guys in there with guns for security

434
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:34,039
they all have their own logistics tail

435
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,509
what you've just done is destroyed any
opportunity

436
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,710
up helping the people of Haiti in the
first a

437
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,879
week-and-a-half 10 days okay on

438
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:47,799
so if we get with the intermediaries and
I'll talk about this a little bit

439
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,840
basically what this means is you can
upload at the

440
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,600
individual human level any requirement
like a Romanian here's here's an example

441
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,899
that I used it open

442
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:01,399
everything unicef has something called
rapid SMS it turns out that

443
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:05,419
the size of the kids are made a certain
age is a perfect indicator of health and

444
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,019
so unicef has people going all over
Africa

445
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:11,759
for entering the armor circumference I
think it's called

446
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,990
on 58 yesterday on and don't remember
math

447
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,200
but then there's a wetback and

448
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,379
that populates and it's like a living
mapas African child nutrition well

449
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:27,980
here's an example down a number number
one here to lower thing

450
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,220
a guy has a remaining water pump from
the 1950s apart breaks

451
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,009
this gets posted to the Internet a
Romanian engineer says

452
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,830
that's no longer may but I've got away
from my garage I'll make the park

453
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,918
a German comes in and says all pay the
Fed Ex 3 to get that part from

454
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,740
from Romania to wherever on and then a
Spanish tourist

455
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,159
I says all deliver the part and I will
upload a photo

456
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,350
many some guy here in new york city
that's using Twitter today

457
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,279
pick up to 150 bucks at the time to
create a well in Africa

458
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,059
and 24 hours after he gets the money
there's a picture of the well

459
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:06,580
now I'm assuming he's honest I'm
assuming somebody has checked him out

460
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,460
but the bottom line is he's got it right

461
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,169
and the problem that we have is there
too many little isolated examples at

462
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,759
this and there's no aggregate

463
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,409
Global gifting that we can all put
together but that's coming

464
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:24,279
the Harmonized investments we should be
able to harmonize investments across

465
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:30,070
all of these organizations right now I
would say we're wasting 75 percent

466
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,539
up the money that is being donated to
intermediaries at least 75 percent of

467
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,820
course you all know that foundations are
not here to actually do good

468
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,610
there to protect wealth with the tax
exemption so apart from

469
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,730
ending individual income taxes I would
also and all tax exemptions

470
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,440
on this is an example least two more
sorry it's not a fair picture

471
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,340
but you've got Australia with timber
hauling trucks China road construction

472
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,340
france therefore constructions Greece

473
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,899
shipping too there is no reason why we
cannot use information

474
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:04,879
to create wealth an element of what's
been a friend since he wrote the chapter

475
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,350
on the future of the spy

476
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,350
and not war anti-war 1993 but

477
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,009
alvin and others you ok I've been clear
Thomas to work the wealth of knowledge

478
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:17,869
barry carter a wonderful little book
called infinite wealth

479
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:22,019
so they're information can be used to
create wealth and the significant thing

480
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,980
here that probably keeps me from getting
killed

481
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,419
is that I tell the rust Charles they can
keep their money

482
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:32,230
we don't want their money which just
want the opportunity to

483
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,289
elevate the poor who can create infinite
well for everybody

484
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,309
K knife been very interested in

485
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:44,619
data pathologies and and so forth and
these are some of them these all have

486
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,080
book titles in

487
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,269
you can look into them basically right
now we have this massive information

488
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:50,639
asymmetry

489
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:54,269
between the people in power everybody
else and it shouldn't be

490
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:57,190
concentrated wealth and fragmented
knowledge it should be the other way

491
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,059
around

492
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:01,408
it should be concentrated distributed
knowledge on

493
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:06,149
I mean just everybody has a grip on
knowledge and and wealth is distributed

494
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:09,980
I believe in the United Nations not

495
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,350
as a government I mean they make the US
government look like a ballerina

496
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:20,360
are when it comes to bureaucracy

497
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,480
what's a little fiefdoms lots a little
Kings

498
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,100
the rule of law does not apply inside
specific office

499
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,399
but I believe that we should create a
multi-national

500
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,789
Decision Support Center that has to wait
reach back

501
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:39,879
and it basically can get any information
in any language from any country

502
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,539
and at the same time be able to make
sense

503
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,809
up this arm I have fought for

504
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:51,220
forget 22 years now to try and get an
open-source agency created

505
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,350
and what are the reasons they won't let
me do it apart from the fact that they

506
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,049
think I have anger issues

507
00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:00,739
on I don't not anymore i'm on medication
it's working

508
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:06,889
on but the reality is that terrified
because they know that if I put a 125

509
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:09,700
million down on open source intelligence

510
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,259
within the week the president is going
to say I'm getting this from open

511
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:17,049
sources what the fuck are you giving me

512
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,730
for $75 billion dollars a year okay

513
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,129
I can put these guys at a business just
going head to head as I did with the

514
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,749
bright the exercise in the Aspen Brock
Commission

515
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:30,249
alright that's not what they want now
I've learnt

516
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:33,409
I was one of the year

517
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:38,590
one of the wounded from the 1992 on
National Security Act I've learned

518
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,239
you have to tell idiot congressman that
reform can be a job in revenue neutral

519
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:45,809
district by district and state by state

520
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:50,519
and I can make that trooper I can move
butts in seats from the secret world to

521
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,210
the non secret world I can move people
from

522
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,809
from scanning the internet to cutting
the backs of books and

523
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:01,269
and scanning the matter but the reality
is right now we're spending $75 billion

524
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:04,220
dollars a year to enrich contractors

525
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,389
and they're providing at best four
percent of what we need to know

526
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:12,570
that's an outrage there's no feedback
loop between citizens who pay taxes and

527
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,970
the government that gives the money away

528
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,389
so the search rescue network is
something that that I created as a patch

529
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:18,970
for

530
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,340
intelligence network in my idea was that
eventually

531
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,809
everybody would have the the ultimate
open source analytic tool kit which we

532
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:28,039
still don't have

533
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:31,679
at 5800 to you can find three all source

534
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,749
decision analysis tool kits designed in
nineteen eighty five through nineteen

535
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:36,480
eighty

536
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,649
8 and we still don't have that because
Michael safe

537
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:43,749
Microsoft still loves to fuck with API
said and create toll booths

538
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:49,289
on and Google's know better okay I'm not
a happy camper about Google

539
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,299
Larry Page and I remember the same
hackers organization

540
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:56,299
and I like larry but engineers don't
know shit about ethics

541
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:59,309
and they don't know much about
integration of data either

542
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,158
arm I hope I'm not offending anyone here
but the reality is that when computers

543
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,110
were first designed nobody talked to
library

544
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:11,139
okay they became electronic waste
baskets and only now

545
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:14,450
are we getting to the point where we can
have attributes that the data level and

546
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,460
stuff like that i mean i PC the sex
thing is wonderful

547
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,499
I'm very concerned about the cloud I've
posted a couple notes on the cloud

548
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:24,749
meeting said we weren't invited

549
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:28,230
okay that was venture for sold out to
Google

550
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,119
Larry brilliant sold out to go and then
came to his senses and left

551
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,700
on but the reality here is a Google is
evil

552
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,499
mom Google is not only stealing all of
your information

553
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:43,879
what you getting a search now depends on
who's paid for what you will see

554
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:47,559
okay they have programmable search
engines

555
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:51,279
did anyone catch a part about me not
being happy camper with cool

556
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,460
okay on so this is food and education
and then for the occasional person that

557
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,029
needs to be killed but I invented the
concept of one man one bullet

558
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:03,629
and the US government still cannot do
that me take an israeli

559
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:08,639
on I believe cell phones in call centres

560
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,929
are going to be the next major
breakthrough I believe that Brazil China

561
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,530
India Indonesia Iran and Russia in
particular

562
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,629
need to create call centers where they
educate the poor who get free cell

563
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,609
phones now nokia has a cell phone that
recharges on ambien energy

564
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:27,750
it doesn't need an electrical source
this is way cool

565
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,510
are the chinese have cell towers that
are

566
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,020
are run by solar and wind energy at
Burning Man

567
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,899
they're going to create the world's
first serious private telephone network

568
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:43,529
okay it's totally open source screw AT&T

569
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,669
okay on

570
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,759
I mean most if you probably know if this
seems like an older generation

571
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,889
the last time I came we had people
carrying babies and little hackers and I

572
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,930
really loved it but

573
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,379
the seems like an older group this year
but the bottom line is the first hackers

574
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,290
with a ham radio operators

575
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,070
and so we're getting back to taking the
airwaves again

576
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,300
with smart computing and that's a good
thing on

577
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,940
so I believe we should educate the poor
one so call at a time

578
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,240
they will create infinite wealth by
being connected and oh by the way

579
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,470
there's no government on the planet

580
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,470
that could afford the early warning
system that is provided

581
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:29,290
by sixteen different farmers calling in
with the GPS location from their cell

582
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,580
phone in a photo saying

583
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,380
dead bird it doesn't get any better than
that

584
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,760
okay so we need to make cell phones free
and ubiquitous and they have to stop

585
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,680
killing peace

586
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,440
did you all know that they're killing
babies this is really ugly

587
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,580
okay because peace turn out to be
fundamental in this is what I mean about

588
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,830
the precautionary principle I mean

589
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,590
we have a government there is operating
on at best two percent other relevant

590
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,280
information

591
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,450
worldwide I was like second graduate
thesis the average embassy

592
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,180
can collect so I'll take a five-minute
sideline here because this is fun

593
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,779
on the average embassy the diplomats
read the minority

594
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,140
the only people who have money to spend
at the spies and I was 10

595
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,190
spend a hundred thousand dollars a month
at the age of 38

596
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,840
it was way way fun but I'm not sure I
was producing very much

597
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,830
on and so despised him and if you commit
treason before the lesson to you

598
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:30,770
everybody else in the Embassy is at the
mercy the physics of a 24-hour day plus

599
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,420
who is willing to be seen talking to you

600
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,400
and because you can't send stuff back in
the pouch

601
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,210
without coordinating with other sections
but electronic does have to be

602
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,270
coordinating

603
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,180
coordinated you end up sounding eighty
percent of it back so bottom line is we

604
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,000
collect the best 20 percent

605
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,090
we spill eighty percent of that on the
way back to washington

606
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,760
and a pretty sure the same is true for
for other major governments

607
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,640
on the reason this happens is because

608
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,660
governments are being run by ideologies
they're not intelligence-driven

609
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,810
governments

610
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,620
cannot intelligence driven governments
because we're not holding them

611
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,900
accountable

612
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,810
dennis is a little schematic you can
look at later are these are the four

613
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,350
quadrants

614
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,100
most people are still in quite what run
knowledge management

615
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,330
I I P six you know that kinda stuff most
if you're quite ripped through

616
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,830
collaborative work

617
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,910
that Twitter's getting really cool I
love Twitter's real-time

618
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,730
on trending I also love being able to
see a map of Twitter

619
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,710
and find one person standing on one
street corner that I can Twitter to and

620
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,010
say what do you see

621
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,240
okay that is really cool

622
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,240
I bennett quadrant three for the last
twenty years

623
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,480
and we're still nowhere near quadrant 4
on

624
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,570
but but maybe one day I've spent 22
years in my life for this little

625
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:55,490
open source agency which very foolishly
was put under CIA arco equal to see I

626
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,540
want to point that out

627
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:03,300
Co equal to CIA that's in advance it
should be under diplomatic auspices

628
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,440
because the US government is the
beneficiary open source intelligence

629
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,480
it is not the patron

630
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,900
it's the damn with its third cousin
drooling

631
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,040
that need some soup okay and this

632
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,660
open source agency sorry I

633
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,009
just have this gift fair

634
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,310
up this open-source agency could sell
very quickly

635
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,690
reduce our federal government by
two-thirds

636
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,080
if not three-fifths for more
three-quarters

637
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,220
it gets so very quickly and the fifty
percent of waste

638
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,410
it gets sold very quickly and the
corruption

639
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,490
it could so very quickly stabilize the

640
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,850
wrote skin equities between a living
wage

641
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,020
and some idiot tickets $10 million
dollars because there's no one out there

642
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,690
that's holding them accountable

643
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,840
for FX on to this is important for

644
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,600
this open-source agency got into the ass
into the 9/11 Commission report only

645
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,589
because Lee Hamilton Watch meat beat the
shit outta the intelligence community

646
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,290
was six phone calls for the aspirin
brown Commission on Brandi

647
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,680
okay so it's taken 21 years to get to
that and I hope it doesn't take another

648
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,540
twenty one years to get to a real

649
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:25,540
open source intelligence community

650
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,120
if anyone knows who actually created
this lovely more picture please tell me

651
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,089
because I've been dying to give that
person credit

652
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,100
ever since I found it for got where I
got it this was created by someone else

653
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,870
now this other one is a book that I
wrote

654
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,410
its own its on Amazon but unfortunately

655
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:48,000
colour wirebound full-size cost 65 bucks
because Amazon takes

656
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,670
Amazon takes fifty-five percent but you
can print it yourself for 20 bucks

657
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,570
at any FedEx office and Dom

658
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,700
I'd be glad if you thought it was worth
looking at the chapter on

659
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,060
substantive governess is alone

660
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,450
something I know Obama has not read on

661
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,520
and I i believe that Obama okay

662
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,150
a a

663
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:20,950
pain now that's not Obama after his wife
told everybody to go to louisiana they

664
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:26,799
went to maine I know that's not Obama

665
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,230
get someone just unplug this a

666
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:34,700
alright

667
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:41,320
a a

668
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,329
a

669
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:48,560
again I don't want to break it

670
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,259
by

671
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,530
the bottom line here is that this book
is available

672
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:02,150
online for free okay and the strata

673
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,690
580 parts

674
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,369
it is a true party gets here

675
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:11,799
there is a wonderful book out now called
the grand illusion

676
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:14,859
could somebody to 40 I have fun this
same

677
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:19,430
on it's a two-party territory

678
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,069
a gerrymandering secretaries of state

679
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:26,670
that on

680
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,300
lasso there must be something you can do
for

681
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,230
sir there are thank you though they're
looking into the on fire alarm situation

682
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,820
if there's a fire

683
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,470
well you know says they see that

684
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,940
yeah for adult leadership

685
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,130
love it on eye-catching to rate this

686
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,210
because I'll tell you frankly it is a
book about a guy called the average

687
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:54,950
American

688
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,170
and it's such a wonderful book because

689
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,730
at the end of it when the guy went back
to tell them you're the average American

690
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,410
the guy said wow what an honor

691
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,290
right okay

692
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,920
that guy is more fit to be president
than Obama

693
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,000
were clinton or anybody else because all
it takes is

694
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,320
ethics I use to put ethics and as an
attribute on all the stuff I publish I

695
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,310
finally realized why am I doing this
ongoing ethics on every sec

696
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:28,259
okay ethics matters and we're not
teaching ethics and we're not demanding

697
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,810
FX

698
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:33,930
and that is our fault alright this is
how you get hold of me

699
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,180

editor that wants to be

708
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:10,130
it's a site that's dedicated to public
intelligence

709
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,920
in the public interest so that concludes
my prepared remarks

710
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,859
and I would be glad to answer questions
for the

711
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:21,750
for nineteen minutes that we have left
now please stay on topic

712
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,270
okay nothing about 9/11 nothing about
Dick Cheney cross-dressing

713
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,640
okay all that stuff is gonna be at spy
am proud of

714
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,089
well i wanna talk about here today is
hacking humanity

715
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:39,750
sir 911 cross-dressing I'll see you at
midnight tomorrow

716
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,810
you keep talking about waste

717
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,150
K can you hear

718
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,480
you you keep talking about waste

719
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,770
from my perspective the definition of
waste is the utilization of resources

720
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,350
that don't accomplish the goals

721
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:57,960
you from my perspective

722
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,210
maybe's organizations that you call
wasteful are actually accomplishing your

723
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,760
own goals their goals are just not what
your goals are which is the benefit

724
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,300
to humanity so I don't know how you deal
with that because these organizations

725
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,460
are set up that way for a particular
reason which means

726
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,600
they take hundred dollars they spent
eighty five dollars on themselves

727
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,450
fifteen dollars may be accomplishing the
goals for which their charter is

728
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,390
maintained and set up but

729
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,170
it's accomplishing their goals and that
you're so I don't know how you deal with

730
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:26,570
that

731
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,390
you talk about reform up the political
process and the

732
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,950
government process but these things are
set up by controlling interest for the

733
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,350
benefit of them and not us and I don't
know how you

734
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,839
accomplish reform an environment with
controlling interests

735
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,780
not only do not want reform but what
actively fight against reform using

736
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,609
various mechanisms which Mayor Mike

737
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:49,319
may not be banned from time to time with
you I'm with you on

738
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,830
I'm trying to get online I'm not sure if
I can without some convoluted sign in

739
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,210
%uh server not found okay story my life

740
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,140
on I just posted a guest review

741
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,200
other book on bureaucracy and it's a

742
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,200
in

743
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:17,369
alright

744
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:22,170
is there any

745
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,290
I guess it's not worth it for 50 minutes
on

746
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,009
bureaucracies

747
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:32,670
bureaucracies have what's called a
multiplicity Ventress

748
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,660
because what keeps happening is stuff
keeps being added to the as people get

749
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,350
bribed

750
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,890
to basically expand the mission that's
why you have a Department of Agriculture

751
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,270
where

752
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,430
one side is killing Gophers in the other
side is

753
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,460
making love to go first okay literally

754
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,660
on but the bottom line here cya trying
to get some nice graphical images to

755
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,259
wake you up

756
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,460
on Janet Napolitano with the golfer

757
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,100
for this works for me other

758
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,859
okay sorry them so the bottom line here

759
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:08,350
is information asymmetry sky mean one of
the things that's been said about

760
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,339
secrecy

761
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,460
and then this is on the record ninety
percent of secrecy is about turf

762
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,850
protection

763
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,890
it's about protecting the contract from
oversight

764
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,670
if I were ever named a director National
Intelligence the first thing I would do

765
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,780
is invite the Gaon

766
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,520
okay the general Accountability Office

767
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,970
on because the fact is the US
intelligence community is completely

768
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:35,800
immune to

769
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,660
any kind of accountability I mean even
my cave who's got two strikes against

770
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,200
them

771
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,710
he loves torture and he does walk
warrantless wiretapping and I told them

772
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,280
in both instances

773
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,440
it was a bad idea on he has said that
when he tried to close down compartments

774
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,109
at NSA the one guy who could brief
mother compartment

775
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:59,060
was the guy who would lose a senior
executive status as budget

776
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,400
okay so the whole system is right and we
need to flush it

777
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,050
and we flush with WikiLeaks and things
like that

778
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,810
on I love wiki leaks i mean WikiLeaks
has been irresponsible in some cases

779
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:16,230
kinda like it kid on high on

780
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:21,250
this bowl thing that you drink are but
yeah

781
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:25,430
but the reality is the only thing that
can correct

782
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,020
our government and our corporations is
sunlight

783
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,550
and so if you wanna start hacking I
would say start acting for substances

784
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,150
that a for technical pass

785
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,970
yes sir %uh the previous gen when had a
point

786
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:42,310
whereas the long time ago corporations
and companies use to have tartars

787
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,450
which were they still do they are
chartered by the public

788
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,060
yeah but that they had tried as well as
they had a purpose to serve the

789
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,190
community

790
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,840
and they were sometimes is all the ones
that purpose has been served

791
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,080
and also we should the use perhaps a

792
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,109
some open intelligence to

793
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:05,180
exactly put some muscle strain on some
things

794
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,180
I to expose what's really going on be
would like for example the

795
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,500
question here some nurses so basic
statement night

796
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,570
370 somali Empire kinda

797
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,270
on okay on his right

798
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:23,190
your mike's been cut and will not be
restored on

799
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,740
he's got a point corporations are in
fact

800
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,810
supposed to be chartered in the public
interest

801
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,380
and the only reason that we're not
taking their charters away just because

802
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,940
we're letting them get away with things
like different sets of books

803
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,770
they have one set a box for shareholders
say look how much money we made

804
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,810
and I have another share books for the
IRS which has no cuz much money we lost

805
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:52,040
of that shouldn't be allowed I mean
Halliburton paid $15 million dollars in

806
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,040
taxes at the height of the Iraq war

807
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,820
when it was basically making out like
gangbusters okay

808
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,640
so again I come back to this whole idea
packing humanity it's basically two

809
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,640
parts

810
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,560
part 1 is outing corruption and part two
is empowering the poor

811
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,970
with cell phones that run and get energy
that have free cell phone access in the

812
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,619
hope it so that's that's my two-part
solution

813
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,030
we have another question a you have a
question

814
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,390
yes where is the question and read the
center

815
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:27,400
were here okay thank you certain my
question is

816
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,020
I wanna go back to your comment about
enough eyes on a problem

817
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,720
makes them visible on with software

818
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,030
this is true because the people looking
at the code no

819
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,060
about writing software massacre a
question in

820
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,230
the case love the world in its
information

821
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,680
everybody with an eyeball has a brain

822
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,600
in a mouth and that brain makes
judgments has biases

823
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,500
a has its own goals which may be
counterproductive to

824
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,350
humanities goals what do you do about
that

825
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,859
you go with the flow which is actually
better or

826
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:08,009
this is a wonderful question I want to
spend some time on it

827
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,100
number one it's been found that

828
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,440
diversity and the reason I subtitled
this book clarity diversity integrity

829
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,760
and sustainability is because we have
none of those four things now

830
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,510
in our present governance and corporate
systems or academic

831
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,770
or whatever on it's been found

832
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:29,790
that secretaries and maintenance man
have phyto phyto

833
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:34,310
contributions to make and this might
have been in the innovator's dilemma

834
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,600
but it was in one of the books by that
guy talked about how reebok was sitting

835
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,250
around having a vice presidential level
meeting

836
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,270
and they were talking about how do they
expand their market share and what new

837
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,490
products the stuff in the security guard
the kept walking back and forth and

838
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:49,280
sticking his head it finally came in and
sat down

839
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,580
and they let him sit down which was the
first smart decision

840
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,810
and finally after a few minutes EC put
up as haces look

841
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,480
people like me need reeboks that look
like business shoes but feel

842
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,630
like athletic shoes $28 million dollars
for first-year

843
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,960
okay so I if I were ever T&I the first
thing I would do is fire all the senior

844
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,730
executives and I would have a
Secretary's day

845
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,109
and I would put them in charge for at
least a week

846
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:22,700
are and secretaries know who's 4shared
and who really has their act together

847
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,609
on and were simply not tapping into the
people that were actually committed a

848
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:33,730
to doing the public interest that does
not include any sess

849
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:38,020
from general clapper to general powell
our senior officers have given up their

850
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,560
integrity

851
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,990
had powell challenge Dick Cheney on a
rocky would be president today

852
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:48,960
okay he gave it up Jim clapper gave it
up when he agreed to let bob gates

853
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,950
continue to run the department of
defense without any reference to

854
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,240
intelligence

855
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,120
call this intelligence-driven
acquisition intelligence-driven

856
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,240
operations intelligence-driven training
and education

857
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:04,140
we still teaching we still have a
multi-billion dollar sign up community

858
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,160
and the enlisted guys at fort bragg the
largest part of their training program

859
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,460
is still how to load Ayer cannisters

860
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,530
with leaflets to drop on countries where
nobody can read

861
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:19,540
I do not make this stuff up alright

862
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,470
so the bottom line here if you're
seriously underestimating

863
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,520
the the aggregated intelligence of the
group

864
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,930
and you're seriously underestimated the
degree to which diversity

865
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:33,920
helps now well I have a problem with
Google apart from the fact that

866
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,750
its toll Yahoo's farm search engine

867
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,810
and only belatedly paid them a billion
dollars for it and it also

868
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,900
because Hewlett Packard was stupid and
killed after the stuff

869
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,190
it was able to get all those brilliant
people at all to the state and come in

870
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:50,950
it so for you know a girl is making a
dollar a day

871
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,069
or a dollar for every ten million in
taxpayer already

872
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:57,310
an investor fantasy cash that they they
get

873
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:01,790
okay they're still have urgent money and
they're still focusing on less than two

874
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,720
percent of the information

875
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,760
they don't duty web they go to seed
rights there's

876
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,230
in I'm one of those people to lease
their email every day

877
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:14,680
I don't really want 7,000 megabytes of
Google storage

878
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,720
on so you need to think through all of
these things they have done

879
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,640
absolutely nothing for sensemaking

880
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,930
there are 18 functionalities that an
analyst needs on their desk in global

881
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,030
has not touched a single one of

882
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,530
in my book that's a crime against
humanity

883
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,700
okay on I hope their people from goal
here

884
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,950
I hope you quote me Larry Page knows who
I am on

885
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,130
and other question yeah arm

886
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,930
sorry wildflower are I have a question

887
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,370
I've spent the last couple years arm
trying to you

888
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:56,580
in bed myself through social engineering
into various government organizations

889
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,700
and what I've noticed is that

890
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,560
I have actually become kind of like
black hearted and evil

891
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,660
a because the only way you can move up
in these organizations

892
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,470
is just total total corruption arm

893
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:16,200
and I thought I could reform from the
inside but

894
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,490
I don't think it's even possible and

895
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,490
I'm kinda facing this problem because

896
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:26,970
I've noticed that the people who have
the real power to change things

897
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:32,560
are the ones who are inside n even to be
there I don't you have one minute so let

898
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:32,900
me

899
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,740
let me let me answer that I've got one
minute and then it will stop

900
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,240
and I hope many are you show up arm

901
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,690
because I'm doing everything I can to
get killed in guatemala and

902
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:47,970
so I'd like to go for six hours and the
Sun comes up and I Drive to Virginia

903
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:52,569
on you're absolutely right

904
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:56,440
about not being able to reform from
within and very tired

905
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,140
lectures on this end and if you go to
Phi Beta Phi iota you can see the ninety

906
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,160
eight categories that I read in

907
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,470
mom and executive part of San failure
and

908
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,750
best practices in business or a couple
other um

909
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,870
but

910
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,440
where I think we're going is we're going
to create the world

911
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,260
brain HG Wells define

912
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,609
and one of the reasons I am still

913
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:29,990
moderately upset about Google is because
Google wants to manipulate the world

914
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:33,839
brain they don't actually want to let it
be

915
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:37,529
they wanna own it they want to have told
gates on everything this is why

916
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,770
the Boston libraries through their ass
at a Boston

917
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:47,080
okay so Google is evil so our
bureaucracies that are not transparent

918
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,660
it where I think we need to move toward
is full transparency

919
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:56,250
and right just hacking in 1994

920
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:01,450
by told this group that they should be
hacking for holes

921
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:05,160
I and they should be giving the
company's 30 days to fix the holes and

922
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,490
then publicizing

923
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:10,609
and that never really took off but I
think we should be hacking for the truth

924
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:16,140
wanna my phrases is the truth any cross
lowers all other costs

925
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,319
k their other excellent truth quotations
on 5800 to the chairman in japan it's

926
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:22,830
actually it's actually says

927
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:26,740
no matter how ugly the truth is until
you get it on the table you cannot

928
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,450
address it

929
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,430
okay this entire country is delusional

930
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,350
it's completely out of touch with
reality and so is the US government

931
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,540
and I will tell you most of the people
the US government art good

932
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,580
people happy to have a job okay

933
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:47,759
there badly let their badly trained
they're not audited worth a damn

934
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,190
%uh and as you say bureaucracies move
away from their goals

935
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,980
arm so let's reconnect I have to stop
now let's reconnect at

936

939

944
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,650
questions

945
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:36,020

clear

950
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,850

walking around

951

able to run out and

952
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:04,140
