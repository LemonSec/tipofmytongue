1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,949
X the maker village demos vendor tables

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:10,260
and more and this presentation is why
you should be an amateur

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,679
and we'll talk about a few things run
talk about what amateur radio isn't

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:15,160
isn't

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,859
what you can do with amateur radio on
charge was gonna heads up to you guys in

6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:19,980
the back up by pardon me

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,789
um how much a radio can benefit you

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,320
how you can benefit amateur radio and
how to actually become an immature

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,179
before I forget Sunday bartender one

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:34,210
testing on the 64 how hope never to say
that again

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,030
whom I am an amateur radio operator in
one WBV

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,620
held next class license I've been into
radio since the late nineteen eighties

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,739
I saw my first shortwave radio back but
then I fell in love

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,660
I'll license since 1995 as an amateur
radio operator

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,100
and I'm I'll mailed it mild-mannered
InfoSec petitioner by day and wild trees

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,629
used by night so everyone's heard has

17
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:03,410
prague stereotypes imagery I think big
radios they think are as follows:

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,020
gadgetry that you actually can drive and
I think all people with huge in tennis

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,590
you know this is the the cuz this is
exactly what we aren't when you talk

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,360
about hacking

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,869
you're no longer the you know guy in
front of Petersburg cigarette and I

22
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:22,549
don't know what that website is but
that's what ever I pulled up on google

23
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,220
image search

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,289
so here's what amateur radio

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,000
is and some people might not realize
this on the art left there with the

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,150
computer in the or WiFi antenna if they
are 25 mile wifi link

27
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,590
out to an island and I believe was in
Norway and

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,210
you actually sit down that that green
and yellow thing down on the bottom

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,049
right next the laptop can

30
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:49,399
ok is a battery so that means that it's
completely off the grid

31
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,159
over here is a senior William she's the
I International Space Station of flight

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,969
engineer for our expedition 1415

33
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,170
and she's doing an amateur radio contact
with the school

34
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,740
arm I think it's an indie and I'm not
sure up she was a

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,590
she is an amateur radio operator and I'm
drawing a blank on a call sign and I

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,149
apologize she ever watch sis

37
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,430
up she was a fairly active on the
International Space Station

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,090
how many people actually hear it knew
that there was an amateur radio station

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,599
on the International Space Station

40
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,170
good good people already excellent and
%uh this actually get coverage

41
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,970
up earlier this year was a guy who
decided to flying near

42
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,050
a space balloon out of our Britain he's
a

43
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,010
what they didn't actually cover house
kinda annoying to this is that he was an

44
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,220
amateur radio operator and that's how we
got the

45
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,510
tractors payload and how we got the
images of

46
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,510
I believe g0 s

47
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,179
you W and I'm probably getting their own
cuz I don't have my notes from its

48
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,750
so simply put amateur radio is radio
hacking I think we all like hacking here

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,349
so

50
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,340
if you like radio its you know it's like
peanut butter and chocolate they go

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,860
together

52
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,290
so let's start off first little bit him
its history

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,530
amateur radio for started with her
really the first experimenters they were

54
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,090
amateurs and they want to

55
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,590
start experimenting with this radio
thing so marconi Tesla

56
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,830
like the room behind us arm into names
that you really might not know Arnold

57
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,739
festered and and Edwin Armstrong

58
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,900
there early experiment urs and they did
a lot of %ah

59
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,069
early groundwork in really brought radio
to what we know it as today

60
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,519
Irish radio in the US was officially
established

61
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,230
on the you in 1912 with the radio act

62
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,019
put a good idea for a name for bill it's
a lot of those a stupid acronyms

63
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,950
are so it was actually heavily
influenced by industry like marconi

64
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,879
because they have their little sandbox
and they don't want anyone else in there

65
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,849
and they wanted to really shows any type
I'll competition out

66
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,230
so the privacy asians are limited to
1500 killer hurts and above

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,260
minutes room in just put in the taste
term steps just above the AM broadcast

68
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,679
band

69
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,780
cuz right at that point those
frequencies were considered useless

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,760
no one will use those there then we
can't do anything with them though Bali

71
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,018
out a couple years

72
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,069
group so

73
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,430
what are the things you do they were
trading I think that's how everyone is

74
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,569
familiar with is a you can talk to me

75
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,129
a everyone around the world and UTC know
it

76
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,850
picture the big bearded guy with
suspenders talking in front of this huge

77
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,639
radio with the huge antenna

78
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,810
on those no smoking a cigar something on
these are called this is within the high

79
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,520
frequency bins now

80
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,669
it's actually interesting because that's
how the term got started with

81
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,799
high-frequency the limit us to the

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
high frequencies then they started
realizing there was a lot more

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
frequencies above them

84
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,970
group um usually a big radio

85
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,180
like the one right here and there's a on
hand right next to it um

86
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,570
there it big in tennis too because you
with a high frequencies you need to have

87
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,680
it up

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,889
there de radio wavelengths which is the
amount of a single cycle over radio wave

89
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,710
is out new usually measured in multiple
meters like 30 80 or 160

90
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,349
up what some uneasy it start it usually
car radio would cost somewhere between

91
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,880
five hundred and fifteen thousand
dollars small radio down here

92
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,729
which actually we have on display in in
use at the amateur radio station right

93
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,099
on the eighteenth floor

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,789
on that'll cost is expressly much
cheaper say Jeffrey combined you can

95
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,070
tell how small it is

96
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,900
you can also talk to people around your
area this is a VHF and UHF which is very

97
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,039
high frequency

98
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,509
and ultra high frequency so Sarah
tacking on extra adjectives a

99
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,800
to describe high frequencies because
they kept on really realizing there was

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,949
water from

101
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,280
this goes up to thirty megahertz
although it I'll up to 32 hurts

102
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,130
most the amateur activity is under one
gigahertz

103
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,710
are small radios and I meant to take
this out

104
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,599
this is actually the radio in the upper
portion here its nice little hand-held

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,570
great cost me

106
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,020
under 200 dollars to buy ok

107
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,380
I'll and they're cheaper too up 100 mean
this was a relatively best bang for your

108
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,880
buck Craig but of

109
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,919
there's radios out there that'll cost
you

110
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,799
be more or less a hundred dollars they
don't have as many bells and whistles as

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,710
this one but

112
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,060
the hit you on the air and transmit a
signal the one down here this is what

113
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,340
would be referred to as a mobile rig as
I can you can stall in your car

114
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,380
that'll cost you about your closer to
the fuck 5 her dollar range you

115
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,080
sometimes you getting cheaper

116
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,229
his depending on tape features you can
see him as cheap as

117
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,008
150 200 dollars

118
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:33,389
so I say between high frequency in very
high frequency and ultra high

119
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,289
frequencies

120
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,349
are VHF UHF is primarily line-of-sight
five walks which is more or less with

121
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,630
this radio will put out

122
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,880
will give you a few miles an average
train if you move up

123
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,250
are to a higher level like say the 18th
floor of the hotel Pennsylvania

124
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,199
they'll give you even more range arm now
there's a special way of doing this

125
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,020
where

126
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,130
I don't always wanna get myself on top
of to a tall building to talk to people

127
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,680
so people have done if they put
something called a repeater

128
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,479
on top of a tall point at which point it
listens to your signal and retransmit

129
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,620
so I can't use this radio to talk to you

130
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,250
%uh you know this far away from Mike in
southeastern Massachusetts I can't I

131
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,389
can't I start talking people in Rhode
Island

132
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,590
such arm high frequencies the it

133
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,840
interacts with the ionosphere part of
the atmosphere a signal skip of the

134
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,319
ionosphere and are reflected back to
earth

135
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,419
I can't go up to arrange the hundreds to
thousands miles

136
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,810
right now I'm not even an hour ago we
had two contacts of the N 28 station

137
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,979
one was in Hungary and the other one was
in croatia as was all three Chugh in

138
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:37,789
this was

139
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:41,818
a very weak signal even an army amateur
radio terms it was only putting out five

140
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,270
what's

141
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,620
normally with each after talking about
now a hundred or so

142
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,270
there are subcultures in there to try to
run as less power as possible as long as

143
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,340
a and there's also a culture out there
are safe let's run as much power as

144
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,580
possible

145
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,099
we have strange hobbies up

146
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:03,378
so lighter side repeater so say for
example I'm

147
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:06,550
here you can tell cuz my chisel John
wonderful here

148
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,410
I I'm talking on my a small portable
radio there and I'm

149
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,710
a relatively high point however there's
a very high mountain rangers back at me

150
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,379
are normally like to talk to the space
station down here cuz I'm hiring him and

151
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,050
I can hear him he could hear me

152
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,280
but this mobile station would have been
able to hear me so some

153
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,759
enterprising him of got on top of this
mountain and is usually a commercial

154
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,990
site on their usually work out an
agreement where

155
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,969
take away you know store this Richie
money cuz we're obviously usually say

156
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:33,740
yes

157
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,299
sometimes we have to beg borrow and
steal arm they set up a repeater

158
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,409
we usually don't still it's just a
terminology ahh

159
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,439
so we set up a repeater what the
repeater does it actually listens could

160
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,570
listen to me

161
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,230
I'm sorry be in the bay station and
would retransmit my signal so that

162
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,950
mobile can hear me even though

163
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,720
I can't directly talk to them line of
sight

164
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,850
and how this is accomplished is that the
repeater listens on one frequency

165
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,510
entrance what's on the other

166
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,910
so what everyone does is transferred on
the frequency it's listening to any

167
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,019
could hear all of us

168
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,350
and just retransmit on the frequency
that everyone else is listening to which

169
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,300
is called this output frequency

170
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,970
so %uh HF into interacts with the
ionosphere as I said

171
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,980
and to pay and depending the way the
radio waves bounce of it and what type

172
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,779
of angle

173
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,790
that is far it sent out and it's called
the a take-off angle

174
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,120
it dats how depends on how your
distances like for example you know

175
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,980
if you're really close to the ground and
you your

176
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,920
just looking to talk locally just wanna
have a nice autonomy be a huge

177
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,640
five ten feet off the ground and that
will just talk out with probably within

178
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,000
a 50 mile or a 100 mile radius I'll talk
to you next couple states for you

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,279
muster in California but that's another
story I hmm

180
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,510
so but as you get you know relatively
higher up your

181
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,380
the angles of the radio we start to
decrease and you get while you get bad

182
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,560
you know I didn't initially 50 miles or
so you start talking about

183
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,760
you know fifty miles 100 miles thousand
miles

184
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,170
and the lower the frequency the lower
the up take-off angle a few radio signal

185
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,339
its gets back on the atmosphere in

186
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,860
I'm sure a math major here will know
that the lower the angle something that

187
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,790
impacts would

188
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,610
reflect lower of

189
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,200
however with VHF and UHF there are ways
of extending your signal love the

190
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
were always the people have done this is
you know we talk about a repeater that's

191
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,589
on top of a mountain

192
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:28,410
how much higher can we get onto that
there's people that like to fly

193
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,519
airplanes with radios on them like to
talk to people without miles away

194
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,570
so arm when nasa originally started
going up

195
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,100
there were a lot of amateurs cuz I was
more less a technical hobby

196
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,890
in Nason said hey let's go surfing
similar to radio up in space

197
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,910
up and so currently there are about
somewhere in the range of 10 to 20 are

198
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,420
orbiting satellites at carrier amateur
radio payloads

199
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,599
it that's a lot of fun to operate them
one of the there's three

200
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,839
out there that are currently i cant

201
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,779
as you can tell us a picture me I'm
using a very large I'm using a very

202
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,430
large attend up but I'm also using this
radio it's only five what's

203
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,779
ought to balance my signal of a
satellite I think it I don't know who I

204
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,500
was talking to at this point my friend
took the photo

205
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,110
but I can talk um in eastern
Massachusetts all the way out to

206
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,870
my longest contact with Arizona by
bouncing my signal of this little

207
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,860
satellites called the oh-fifty one down
here in the bottom right

208
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,459
um %uh chat would reflect my signal and
it's basically a repeater in space

209
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,380
in orbits fast enough that I can people
only get usually about 15 minutes use

210
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,899
from all the time it goes

211
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,990
appears over your horizon and den
disappears over

212
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,040
the other horizon but is a lot of fun

213
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,849
dollar do operation all these utmost to
the satellites are low-earth orbiting

214
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,010
satellites

215
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,380
a typical rains like I said it's about
fifteen hundred miles max

216
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,170
up there is one that just got launched
earlier this year by China

217
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,969
that can do transatlantic um contacts on
a

218
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,870
under still kinda va warming up move
fiddling with it but it I was sitting on

219
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,899
top for parking garage

220
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,320
after I got out of work I've had it I
knew that the pass was coming up and I

221
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,260
could listen to it

222
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,519
i turn it on all of a sudden I heard a
station from Spain calling and I'm

223
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,190
kicking myself because they didn't have
the right frequency programmed in to

224
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,300
transmit on

225
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,060
to without any questions what's up year

226
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,380
yes there are programs out there I'm not
sure how many you actually got here 10

227
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,279
a.m. on Thursday like I get

228
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,139
a hug cuz I'm gotta love a 15-month-old
keeps you awake

229
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,800
are there's a bunch of free programs out
there that will track the satellite for

230
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,510
you and say

231
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,079
hey the satellite's going to appear at
such-and-such time it's going to be its

232
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,010
highest point that you can see

233
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,980
at you know about five minutes later and
then it's gonna disappear 10 minutes

234
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,459
later

235
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:48,420
one other programs at Cheshire used bear
his talk trash catalyst

236
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,440
arm was or which on which is the one
that I love I actually don't have

237
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,970
installed this but I can try n

238
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,800
show chief stop by the injury to station
later

239
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,839
not for there are the geostationary
satellites not very much a radius

240
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,540
because are most the time the reason why
that mostly clothes or lose low-earth

241
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,149
orbiting satellites is that we usually
try to

242
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,370
Bob convince someone sending a rocket up

243
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,410
maybe to a geostationary orbit where
their pie repeat primary pillows going

244
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,260
on

245
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,339
put up they say hey you know you did you
listen to what are your second stage is

246
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,410
that gets lost in the atmosphere and
then will separate and take care of it

247
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,360
ourselves so we get kicked out on the
right up

248
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,339
it's cheaper that way currently there is
a satellite that they're trying to put

249
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,470
into a highly

250
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,019
what's called a CEO a high lifter
Corbett

251
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,170
and that can go almost up the
geostationary but then it

252
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,639
rockets back around the earth arm but
that can cover a much wider space

253
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,610
the estimated that it's gonna cost
approximately a million dollars to put

254
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,500
in the space and they don't have that
kinda money so we're kind of scratching

255
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,000
their heads saying how do we keep them
that money

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,269
also data connections their connections
you know everyone thinking out data

257
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,820
connection till my cell phone can you
this yeah it's been around for longer

258
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,709
than you think

259
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,199
are late nineteen forties radio teletype
was around a lot of these a amateur

260
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,500
radio operators coming from

261
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,829
out of the world war two service found
the surplus radio teletype

262
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,829
a to already a teletype machines hook it
up to the amateur radio transmitter and

263
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,720
started banging away on a

264
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,260
best stunning 66 bought

265
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,709
VHF and UHF for fear we limited for
Speed you're talking about 1200 9600

266
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,120
baud respectively

267
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,459
a and fortunately with the mauna be and
with that we have

268
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:35,529
I'll it's not possible to get a higher
speeds and out

269
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:39,680
and I've tried to download something via
TCP IP connection once over this

270
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,399
it's painful over there is an
alternative

271
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,360
fish might take a little legal detour
part 97 apart 15

272
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,110
r15 as consumer devices the every time
you you know you flip over to look at

273
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,730
your remote next time you get home

274
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,310
and you'll see something on the sick the
says this error is this has been

275
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,709
certified the FCC to be conforms with
part 15 standards

276
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,269
and better than the other but legalese
apart ninety-seven per 15 are both sexes

277
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,040
within the FCC Rules

278
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,540
our part 97 governs amateur radio
stations like myself

279
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,040
in more or less the in the FCC's eyes we
are an experimental service we like to

280
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,050
move go around and

281
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,310
do stuff part 15 covers consumer devices
you know have to be tested by the FCC

282
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,449
and once they get that certification
that the short update the me part 15

283
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:25,160
rules

284
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,009
they can no longer be modified mica said
check out your TV remote less time for a

285
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:31,370
bit over you'll see the patents and
you'll see the FCCU

286
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,180
I'll notice on its um

287
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,149
there's a project called high-speed
multimedia and its amateur radio bands

288
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,639
that up overlap the 802 11b NGN 802 11 a
ban segments

289
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,220
our part 15 devices can be fun if I did
poland relief part 97 will set

290
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,800
net means antennas can be modified
frequencies can be shifted and watch can

291
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,670
be increased

292
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,540
how much water do you ask well what's
the part 15 device

293
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,439
OMP usually puts out a max a $250
million watts

294
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,480
part 97 on the other hand currently in
all talk about why I said currently in a

295
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,259
moment

296
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,630
I can go up to 100 watch for spreads
spread spectrum which is why 802 9/ 11

297
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,529
falls under

298
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,380
and while you're kinda stupid if you
really wanna know run this type a water

299
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,889
jury does don't want to have children
can

300
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:25,199
arm you think year legally entitled to
do so

301
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,940
however this may be the future up few
months ago the SEC

302
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,160
really something that they call a new
disapproved remaking

303
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,630
that says okay we will cut out some
regulations on the sped spectrum side

304
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,139
however under reduce your maximum
wattage on the 10 what's

305
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:46,300
alright I kinda I'm as their is anyone
entitles a citizen

306
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,149
but I did as an amateur radio operator I
kinda replied to that notice for pros

307
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,190
room a concert

308
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,410
you okay you know that's really nice but
how do we just cut it down like 25 for

309
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,839
something

310
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,300
I guess they're taking into
consideration I haven't seen a final

311
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,810
ruling yet um

312
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,959
I think I should be coming out within a
month or so I'll probably get

313
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,870
ignored which is understandable they're
a government agency

314
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,350
so what are the big thing said causing
harm high-speed multimedia take off in

315
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,428
certain circles

316
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,949
is on OLSR and I'm don't have my
daughter from me so I'm stritch

317
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,049
it some it's a mesh networking protocol
that allows you to

318
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:27,299
that allows notes to know where each
other are so say for example I meant no

319
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,450
tani wanna take to Node B

320
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,559
there's a path there though that
red-line

321
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,210
it knows that that is the shortest path
possible to get to ok to eat to beat

322
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,370
over let's see what happens if I all the
sudden this this the

323
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,260
unit drops of the network alright well
news to route around it so now that

324
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,789
knows that if you want to go

325
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:50,679
my network I want to talk to be I don't
I no longer talk to this no new talk to

326
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,740
this node federal route me over to be

327
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,940
and along with also CD so say for
example

328
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,440
this one falls off and sort of talk in
the primary path news take a secondary

329
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,240
path

330
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,870
and this is allowing lot of amateur
radio stations to talk to each other

331
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,929
arm via data networks without having to
make

332
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:12,890
you know giant fixed reliable stations
to mesh network

333
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,700
everyone knows about each other else
usually it's all your friends if you see

334
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,870
someone drop off

335
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,190
you can still route around to be call up
the say he Jim

336
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,039
did you well wifi connection drop off
well she's let me check oh yeah

337
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,760
the cat not the power cable up

338
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,679
so I was saying dole come on this is
exciting but I can do this under Part 15

339
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,750
technically you can't it's illegal um

340
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,980
if someone if the FCC catches you doing
it arm

341
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,350
you're going to possibly go to prison or
face fines yes it really could happen

342
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,850
arm in this case in most cases you know
the kind just

343
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,330
no one ever complains so the no one ever
gets caught however

344
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,539
if you start interfering with your
neighbors wifi networking

345
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,450
they know someone at the FCC and they
trace it to you you're going to get a

346
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,830
little notice in the mail

347
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,168
that a notice of apparent liability when
touch with a nice I'll have to find to

348
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:03,429
it

349
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:06,700
up thankfully arm be on this

350
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,630
anything goes you can transmit what you
want as long as you keep within that

351
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,960
part fifteens consumer device you can
use it for whatever you want as long as

352
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,280
you don't modify

353
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,129
I'm like say part 97

354
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,000
with part 97 amateur radio there with
this was part of what they're talking

355
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,500
about with the original radio act
nothing can be

356
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,250
with a pecuniary interest which means
you can't make money be amateur radio

357
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,760
I can start advertising my business are
using a pizza delivery of service can

358
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,179
start using amateur radio dispatches
trucks

359
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:39,630
or did nothing that makes many or makes
my employer money

360
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,480
I also can't play music via amateur
radio

361
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,640
because we don't 10 chocolate in touch
your church

362
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,340
Clear Channel's profits up now does this
mean that

363
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,449
okay so I have an mp3 file sitting on my
server my other friend hooked up to the

364
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,780
wireless mesh network

365
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,879
my friend downloaded of my server did he
just transfer music

366
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,720
there has been a ruling yet are no one
really wants a test that waters and

367
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,070
possibly do with that fine

368
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,770
also he yup are a patch

369
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,429
with this is an auto patch as well which
is another type up to your interest

370
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,740
auto patch was big in the lot early mid
nineties where

371
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,789
someone hook up an amateur radio
repeater and you could dial a phone with

372
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:20,200
it

373
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,750
and everyone thought this was really
cool the time but no one ever use it

374
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,520
anymore cuz we all have cellphones

375
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,918
but it goes back to the same thing i
cant like all of my boss and say

376
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,179
hey you know where do you want to send
me next for the you know my

377
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:38,179
for computer consulting any can't can't
tell me where to go over amateur radio

378
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,419
that's another thing with part 97 on
wireless you also can't use encryption

379
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:49,030
everything you speak open in the clear
um

380
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,620
no encryption everything has to be in
the clear it so this actually is really

381
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,030
interesting because

382
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,480
people are saying well anyone can get on
my end my network now well know what

383
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,799
I'll

384
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,289
what's in I kinda look at this is a
great feeling from the hacker Sykes I'm

385
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:02,000
start saying

386
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,299
hey IP sec we all know I P sec everyone
it's a standard protocol

387
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,700
we can use without encryption but only
authentication error was gonna say

388
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,950
would use that would really work how do
we set that up r8 walton's

389
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,679
work that out with you um

390
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,900
there's also crazy third-party
restrictions Nissenbaum

391
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,510
interacting with unlicensed Asian like
say if you're on a wireless network and

392
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,090
you interact with an Internet

393
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,189
via a license station like myself arm

394
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,549
if there's some restrictions as in you
can start downloading

395
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,870
a naughty pictures or something because
that would be of color and that would

396
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,679
also be

397
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,539
against Eritrea regulations

398
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:46,500
um so if you can do with HS and I'm
sorry come talk about stuff you can too

399
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
it's your own private network do you
realize that we actually as amateur

400
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,809
radio operators have in a giant class

401
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,799
a assigned to us that we can use for in
private use and you know i'm talking

402
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,639
about. RFC 1918

403
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,110
know this is off 44 slab forty 40 000
slashing

404
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,549
to class a network its publicly
writeable internet space if you can find

405
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:09,030
somebody with a BGP connection they can
start advertising your subnet for you if

406
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,020
you'd like

407
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,400
arm and it'll interact with the Internet
in people older people will

408
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,440
router for you unknowns I far as I know
no one has done this

409
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,020
I'd love to see someone try to be great
the moment I'm going to see on my weblog

410
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,500
so I get a hit from a forty four address
I'm going to be jumping for joy

411
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,220
um so it's a data connection across rear
town for telemetry

412
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,850
of my friend larry from Paul dot com kt1
TNF

413
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,720
up and he said hey what if I set up a
UAV for war flying in use it to report

414
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,510
back to the HS mm I was like that's a
great idea

415
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,090
but like I said if you have a friendly
ice people have publicly writeable

416
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,399
addresses

417
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,220
so as we start kinda moving into the
Internet age we had a star saying hey

418
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,080
internet

419
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,470
looks like this might be catching on a
so if

420
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,690
we serve looking at ways of interacting
with the Internet via our radios cuz

421
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,659
were keeps like that up what we came up
with was two different ways of

422
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,070
connecting radios

423
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,668
together via the Internet the internet
radio linking project

424
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:13,799
allows links between radios there's also
another project that cuz called echolink

425
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,270
that allows links between radios or
radio to computer to have a question in

426
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,539
the back

427
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,549
up sorry okay don't worry of stress
before two

428
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:25,720
feels just like high school arm

429
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,650
both accomplish the same thing they
provide links between operators over I

430
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,990
PBS connections now also is that I P
Bass connection

431
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,820
you can be sent out over a high-speed
multimedia network nothing stopping them

432
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,820
so this is echoing I don't have an
assault on this laptop because I wasn't

433
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,639
sure what the type of our

434
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,980
internet connection we would have here
and he's up there if you do between at

435
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,230
a the kinda have some you to poke holes
in your firewall and because it doesn't

436
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,039
like to do on RFC 1918 the internet
dressing

437
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,179
and which plaster banging my head on the
desk ans arm

438
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:01,460
these are a buncha repeaters here and
that is what the are operator has

439
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,690
Germany selected

440
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,539
and these are all appears that are
echoing enable that I can connect to my

441
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:06,600
computer

442
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,470
via the via my via my computer and

443
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,730
interact as if I was are sitting there
locally in Germany with a radio

444
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,140
there's also a tunnel repeaters within
up

445
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,549
with within the United States for we're
actually attempting to try to find one

446
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:24,730
with the new york city that isn't used
too often so we can actually use the

447
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,350
amateur radio station of that

448
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,830
and you know people around the world can
start trying to contact us if they would

449
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,710
like to via the system

450
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,150
nothing you can do with amateur radio
she can build the Modify thing stuff I

451
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,020
need defining characteristic a famous
radio

452
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,918
on you name it you can build our hackett
transmitters amplifiers transceivers an

453
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:43,929
intense

454
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:49,529
are other services like say part 15 that
easy it approved or arm

455
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,970
what's the other one GMRS which and
which is a another type of communication

456
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,929
system

457
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,539
they need to get any time they just the
radios need to get FCC approval

458
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,908
we on the other hand can just remark
about do whatever we want with them as

459
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:02,510
long as we stay within

460
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,299
the approved offering for him present
parameters

461
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,620
there's a great examples was actually
arm during monsoon season amateur radio

462
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,980
operator in DS are seeing all these

463
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,980
villages start being cut off so what he
want to do is create a

464
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,990
small high frequency radio that was
chief to build

465
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,820
easy to maintain and rugged so we came
up with the bid x 20

466
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,080
up and if you can see it's a circuit
board here it's actually

467
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,740
in the grand scheme of things that
circuit board really isn't that

468
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,100
complicated I'm sure

469
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,400
no one's actually are decided to crack
open a rar

470
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,860
a new device are probably going oh my
god it's so complex but this is a fairly

471
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,520
simple transceiver know what it was used
for it was used

472
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,700
to I said use during monsoon season
fleet villages and report back to

473
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,039
other villages they know people are okay
you know we're fine Woodrow's been

474
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,289
washed out but

475
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:55,190
you know please airdrop a supplies or
something

476
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:59,360
and it's our actually was used I believe
that was fun believe it was actually

477
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,650
used in a giant flood they had their

478
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,490
right after a short a really growing up
this program performed admirably

479
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,490
and this is actually all open source the
ER a schematic

480
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,570
is all online it's also the from PCB
board is actually

481
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,678
available for download and printing if
you want to send it out to a PCB

482
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,980
printing service

483
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,350
up and you can set it up yourself and I
know a lot of Hampshire's that have just

484
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,440
love this because it's low power and
they can take another camping trip with

485
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:24,950
you

486
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,960
thrown in 10 up into a tree hook it up
to a battery and they're connected with

487
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,380
the world

488
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,350
know things really interesting is
starting to care is starting to catch on

489
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,590
is called software-defined radio

490
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,740
up now software defined radio allows for
the replacement of various real

491
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,820
components that have typically been
implemented in hardware

492
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,370
down into a software program %uh
directly in this is kind of a high-level

493
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,690
talking about if you don't you're hired
really nitty-gritty if you don't and

494
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,510
radios but

495
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,850
threat for solar radio this lot more
flexible what we're capable

496
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,150
and a lot more hackable I can set up
having to Sri solder a bunch of things

497
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,529
to

498
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:04,049
a at a new filter something it's now
okay let me go apply that patch I just

499
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,020
downloaded off the internet

500
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,480
arm vanity side benefit to this and
they've really wasn't an

501
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,309
a primary benefit when we first design
is that it's very easy to integrate into

502
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:16,850
a computer

503
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,360
now after we started putting these
computer radios in the computer someone

504
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,559
said hey let's keep it up to the
internet

505
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,710
so this guy out in the a.m and when are
mispronounce at the University of Twente

506
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,490
a and the Netherlands

507
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,580
I'll priest are creating a project
called web STR

508
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,340
was a project to allow less care
receivers to be control over the web

509
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,549
and it's %uh PT PT pt de Boer pe3 FWM

510
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:42,600
officially one station at the University
of 20 marilyn's

511
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,149
Netherlands and now almost 13 stations
across the world

512
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:49,309
and what the upside to this is that I
can connect to my

513
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:53,789
connection back in the tectonic faction
load up a web page and I can listen to

514
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:58,658
frequencies from Netherlands eastern
United States western United States and

515
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:01,700
I've had a couple times were trying to
diagnose transmitter issue

516
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,850
and i wanna see him I getting out let's
go tune into a local of

517
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,909
radio stationary close by radio station
to see if they can hear me

518
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:13,010
so let's try demo I'm sure this is gonna
fail miserably

519
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,379
and I don't have an audio feed jerk cuz
they accidentally

520
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,120
messed up that my other presentations
was to have an that didn't need an audio

521
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,880
feed her document camera

522
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,590
they gave me that there but they did not
give me either here whoops

523
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,659
yes nice his

524
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,710
all mode will be able to be connected

525
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,010
and anyone here because it's receive
only

526
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:42,820
you can load this up you can listen to
HF bands and when I wanna try to do

527
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,908
or no please work

528
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:53,440
their ego certain feet up and let's go
on new myself

529
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,940
and this is a graphical representation
of the various bands what we have here

530
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,649
is

531
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,250
I just blew the AM broadcast band
witches are received

532
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,110
it's a receive only and we have just
above the AM broadcast band which is an

533
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,279
amateur been called 160 meters

534
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,990
then we start talking about 80 meters a
one night when I start saying nears its

535
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,850
the arm length the radio signal like I
said before

536
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,480
so let's go yup word sir

537
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,740
have you guys here at all

538
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,740
so that was super make six radio Radio
that since reading

539
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,399
he gets he was going see what's good for
the handover

540
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:36,320
here

541
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,059
at all 14 here

542
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:49,059
here 3ds

543
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,509
okay so he's gonna call sign right now
clinical picture

544
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:57,820
underfoot he's going to call sign right
now I'm calling some the call the CQ

545
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,340
which are basically means I'm here for
anyone wanna talk to me please

546
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,429
and we've kinda been doing this over the
amateur radio station anyone can stop by

547
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:05,679
and we can do a demo for you

548
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,679
spicy we can't find another one this
guy's cock in some foreign leaders etc

549
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:20,580
here if we want to we can also turn into
more scared

550
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:24,590
people still use this for some reason ok

551
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,279
I don't know it this is a very condense

552
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,289
its Morse code is actually easier to
understand

553
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:35,120
and a lot simpler to build transmitters
for so a lot of people like to do it as

554
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,679
a hobby

555
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,360
hobby with an army so what's computer

556
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:46,360
because I really don't feel like having
this for the rest might presentation

557
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,030
so this is the this is the one that was
in the University 20 and actually it's

558
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,840
Peter Bowers

559
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,810
personal device he has a hooked up to
the Aria clubs internet connection

560
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,409
arm it seven bands this is the most
complex is the most complex one is

561
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,090
currently out there cuz he's kinda
really leading the bleeding edge on this

562
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,530
one

563
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:13,530
and I so but there's also ones and
United States has won Spain

564
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,990
I believe there's one that's
specifically

565
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,500
not geared towards satellite operation
and I am

566
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,530
somewhere in southern Europe I forget
where but if you go to websites yard out

567
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,020
work

568
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,889
there's a link to every if the site is
available here actually could be more

569
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,050
than I don't know about

570
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,480
I haven't checked for a while I okay it
actually did work so I don't show you

571
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,610
this is the receiver that we're just
listening to

572
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,310
and as you can tell it's an antenna
connection all in all over on the left

573
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,540
an Ethernet connection on the right was
actually reports into another computer

574
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,180
which does most the web surfing

575
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,440
but I am and break your exit in both the
two main chips arts an analog to digital

576
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,340
converter

577
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,250
and that allows us to actually hear the
radio stations and something that allow

578
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,080
it to our

579
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,379
tune all the stuff this was the old web
SDR receiver and I

580
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,810
it's just the amazing piece of hack

581
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,700
I'll so it's you can tell a major shifts
are still there however I really love

582
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,590
this little small devices were here

583
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,690
and I have mad props to him its 82.2
millimeter wires in a point five

584
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,090
millimeter wire created

585
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,970
and now you can tell why he's a sort of
our actually designed wanna send it off

586
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,220
to be made for the new one

587
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,670
because I wouldn't want to do this once
let alone twice so

588
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,920
everyone's talking about being free
nowadays amateur radios dream we love to

589
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,570
repurpose reuse and recycle

590
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:38,570
our commercial billions of a butt
amateur radio bands

591
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,399
when people are throwing out not
breeding there commercial radio system

592
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,780
hey we could take that from you no
problem we'll take it out we don't have

593
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,330
to worry about making it the

594
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,190
you know safe enough disposing all that
led no problem

595
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,570
are GE Motorola EF Johnson is %uh a
couple other brands can offer review

596
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,840
program through software

597
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,990
unfortunately the software is not open
source in highly expensive however

598
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,040
a lot of people who do commercial radio
star for often amateur so they have the

599
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
software anyway

600
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,140
and you just gotta buy a six-pack arm

601
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,750
so the radios the simple hardware
modifications you know cut her sister

602
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,750
here saw to risk pastor there

603
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,960
arm and you're all set are

604
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,700
Boston up my area there's a group called
GE motor which is GE Motorola that's two

605
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,310
crew that's the two products they love

606
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,850
are they built an entire repeater
network of the surplus 900 megahertz

607
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,960
cure which is the thirty three megahertz
nm

608
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,670
33 centimeter band arm around ok few
years ago

609
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,840
a v missile defense program decided to

610
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,520
in Cape Cod and also in California
somewhere decided to say

611
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,250
a we're going to start not borrow giant
radar re again

612
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,340
unfortunately this also a quarter
collides with your amateur radio banks

613
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,400
where the primary user in your secondary
user so we're taking you a loss

614
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,720
so what we did is we start crying into
our beer

615
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,280
and then we started saying OK work we go
next and we started looking at nine her

616
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,399
megahertz and someone said

617
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,350
well here have the spirit peerless cosa
ne pensi we can do and

618
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:12,159
of so few years later we have this giant
network now

619
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,629
and anyone with a any of the its colors
kinda don't shop too well

620
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:20,210
I'm anyone within the coca-cola area can
talk to anyone else within the cover

621
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,030
area via

622
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,110
a network of linked repeaters via I roll
P

623
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:29,409
in this photo is actually a little old
because doubtlessly read about here is a

624
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:32,290
repeater we just added a couple weeks
ago at my club

625
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,370
that have been tied into the network and
we can probably cover almost all the way

626
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,250
up to prominence

627
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,330
so eastern Massachusetts and Eastern
Ryland

628
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,980
you can pick up a small little HD radio
for about 100 bucks on e-bay

629
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,040
we could have someone program it for you
in your tight into this network for

630
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,580
Peters

631
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,580
works for pagers to

632
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,899
there's this is up oooh two alak

633
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,740
this actually that is in more we I
believe are there some question as to

634
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,880
whether or not

635
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,530
this is legal in the United States we do
those people have been fooling around

636
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,230
with that

637
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,710
no its complaint yet but the arm imagery
deregulation say that

638
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,430
every contact needs to be a two-way
contact and so when you're talking about

639
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,299
to receive only a pager

640
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,300
what does that mean okay so if I say you
know

641
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,730
my friend bob it bob I just sent a
message to you on your pager you know

642
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,109
natpe message says

643
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:27,090
you know please contact me at the
such-and-such megahertz any context P

644
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,330
leader on that free will see to sack out
as two-way contact

645
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:36,200
who knows some people say yes what other
people say no

646
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,180
more recycling I love it when work as a
bad UPS because they don't want to get

647
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,089
rid of it cuz they have to do all kinds
of other stuff with

648
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,900
environmental things I'll take that for
you are recycled the one bad cell that

649
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,040
usually happens

650
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,800
there's usually two or three other
batteries in their the running at 12

651
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,690
volts

652
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,109
i hook up to my amateur radio equipment
I have a battery I can go look at with

653
00:35:55,109 --> 00:36:00,240
me wherever I want albeit the kind of
heavy but whatever

654
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,780
so there's another protocol it's really
start to take off really is called weak

655
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,910
signal propagation reporter and sweeps
it also got

656
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:12,430
whisper who are you it's a digital mode
designed to be heard by computers

657
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,730
underneath the noise so we have a bunch
of static sitting out there on the

658
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,490
band's

659
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,760
now if I listen to is the human ear I
can hear a bloody thing but if i hook up

660
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,170
a

661
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,780
re do. with each over the transmitter
receiver for whisper

662
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,640
you can pull something out of that mess
the year can't discern

663
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,870
it only takes six hurts a band with now
a typical FM broadcast band takes

664
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,540
approximately 10,000 her

665
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,170
for a broadcast passing of expert 10,000
hurts the smallest voice transmission in

666
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,430
amateur radio

667
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,230
is called single sideband that takes
2500 hurts

668
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,560
unfortunately when you're talking about
band with

669
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,040
more band with means more speed we're
talking about six herridge we're talking

670
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,180
about data being transmitted or 1.46
Boyd

671
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,569
who don't try to download anything with
them um primarily issues to report being

672
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,300
sufficiently

673
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,710
HF bands you know someone just sits
there and less lesser transmitter go off

674
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,240
and sees what other cease to people what
people can hear them and makes a nice

675
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,190
little google map it'll soon second

676
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,950
but a and it shows you where your
signals getting out to

677
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:18,280
are can also use for SLU conversations

678
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,120
so he

679
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,620
it's not spread spectrum in the Spurs
specific sense yes

680
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,580
experts

681
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:36,740
very much so and this is exactly what's
showing each of these green lines here

682
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,840
keep losing my mouse cursor is a
separate whisper signal

683
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,210
and the black lines represent one time
period which I believe is five minutes

684
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,500
%uh so say for example is actually a Q
ESO between

685
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,680
a.m. the to stations able

686
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,790
Letterman correctly and that took
approximately are alright but

687
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,380
20 minutes to us a hey I'm here hey I
heard you oh cool its cool I heard you

688
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:01,970
sure

689
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,390
great that's wonderful that took 20
minutes to do so when you talk about

690
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,650
1.46 bought it has

691
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,010
its limits to it however you just leave
it at that they're banging away you make

692
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,410
this nice little google map in this is
our

693
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,589
a map from I think it's a VK four MDX
and he's right here

694
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,010
and you the various stations that have
hurt him overnight

695
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,000
on a wish V his whisper beacon and the
larger

696
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,020
the the thicker the bands are the more
times I've heard him so

697
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,170
this I W E 72 kg x in Washington state
looks like a certain lot

698
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,550
along with this %uh Japanese station J E

699
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,420
OJ SWL which would %uh mean that someone
is receive only in the not much they may

700
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,490
not be licensed

701
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,030
way they can still hear people they just
cant reply back

702
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,850
on they've also made it over to Ireland
up tennis

703
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:55,109
Norway believe and a lot of Kaka
stations over Australia fern

704
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:58,580
I one other big things that people kinda
pushed an amateur radios that we can do

705
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,279
for emergency communications

706
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,630
it was part of the original reason free
materials creation

707
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,770
arced our secret sauce and I'm gonna
tell it to you right now

708
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,940
is that we're highly distributed
communication system

709
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,640
if say for example or tornado takes out
the police station all their radios are

710
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,540
going to be there and they can talk to
anyone

711
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,170
however it's gonna be highly unlikely
that a tornado was going to hit the 20

712
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,880
or so amateur radio operators they have
separate houses

713
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,380
as long as one other stations are
survive your communication network is up

714
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,900
and it's not just in time a disaster if
we like to do drills because we like to

715
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,460
make sure that we're all set

716
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,060
and we also like to do public events and
this is our home

717
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,400
a amateur radio group doing a marathon

718
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,600
and they set up their own they have a
nice alarm a surplus tent in the opry

719
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,450
radio the past traffic between water
station saying

720
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,780
no so-and-so need to refill there's a
runner down at such-and-such a mile

721
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,359
marker bring in the ambulance at
such-and-such

722
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:54,549
arm and one of the big things one of the
biggest events in my area as the Boston

723
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,870
Marathon there's an amateur radio
operator

724
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:02,660
assigned to every water station on the
26-point two-mile route

725
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,790
so here's all the stuff that we got done
with amateur radio

726
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,700
what can you do for amateur radio
because we need you guys

727
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,640
build more things home brew which is
creating transmitter is alive and well

728
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,460
up not however ninety-nine point nine
percent of all projects are in the high

729
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,970
frequency bands

730
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,650
what's so severe chef in UHF some
homebrew love in here

731
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,580
let's go bills and transmitters let's go
see we can do with it because no one

732
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,700
else is

733
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,330
are there still innovation %uh left in
each of their home to rest your project

734
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,779
STR kinda exciting it's kinda
cutting-edge

735
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,140
there's also something called minimalist
radio let's see how few components I can

736
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,770
use

737
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,670
still get a signal out there can be
heard by people and people can

738
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,570
understand me

739
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,870
we also need people to push high-speed
multimedia arm

740
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:51,410
its woefully under utilized it suffers
me class fighters

741
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,629
not being here on radio by the
old-timers

742
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,230
I've gotten too many arguments like that
while I don't condone elder abuse i've

743
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,940
had a

744
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,370
really Cole back hold myself back

745
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,870
arm just a couple weeks ago there were
something there's an event every year

746
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,549
called field day of the last weekend in
June

747
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,089
and what we do is we do a simulated
emergency where we assume that

748
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:15,660
everything has been blown up we set
ourselves up in a field operate for 24

749
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,500
hours

750
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,380
and see how many contacts we can make I
got into quite a few arguments about

751
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,760
nine for megahertz on whether or not
that is amateur radio

752
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,990
some people think it doesn't Obama
couple high-speed multimedia devices

753
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,970
placed on high elevations for five

754
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,220
really good regional coverage I you
place once

755
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,200
you peace one station up into a very
high point you get a bunch of surplus

756
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,770
DirecTV dish is cuz you're all tune for
2.4 gigahertz

757
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,000
you pointed central point poof instead
that work

758
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,359
our ham radio has steadily lost
additional speed race to commercial

759
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,299
alternatives

760
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,320
I mean look at every think everyone here
probably has a cell phone that can do

761
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,660
data

762
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:57,470
let's go try to push back with
innovation to see what we can do with it

763
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,220
we also need to push open source some
amateur radio software is open source

764
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,670
a large portion is not running all
except the

765
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,030
HF station with open source product so

766
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,930
work we're pushing it here on however
close systems are starting to

767
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,669
pushed into our pants icon which is an
amateur radio manufacture came up

768
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:21,120
sorry pushing something called the store
which was a protocol designed by the

769
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,880
japanese amateur radio League

770
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,020
it's great it's an open protocol really
cool

771
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,330
it's a closed codec the cost about two
hundred dollars

772
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,670
the out that's that's not good all of
the innovation I've seen with the star

773
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,140
with people messing around with it and
trying to hack it up

774
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,600
have been without the Kodak because it
actually does provide a digital

775
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,880
but data stream that's kinda cool

776
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,060
on there are some works and trying to
make in a plugin

777
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,100
arm open implementation a.m.

778
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,109
I haven't seen much work with that but I
I for me everyone says I am working on

779
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:54,609
it we're working on it

780
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:58,080
so immature is really don't see this the
problem d-star hey it's all it's you

781
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,370
know

782
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,549
put that all in the works great I can go
talk to anyone in the world just by my

783
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,060
hit microphone all integrated some nice
little public network on the Internet

784
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,339
a I if they don't understand that
there's a problem when we're certain

785
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,750
implementing close systems

786
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,450
simple stuff everyone here probably like
certainly know I'd love to see more ham

787
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,120
radio Arduino projects

788
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,930
I've done a Lysol simple Morse code
buchananites up on my website somewhat

789
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,960
see it I think I have a week later on

790
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,630
arm it links out something it's kind of
overkill I'm

791
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,410
I'm pretty sure was in any 555 timer can
do the same exact thing but

792
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,029
let's see what I am Arduino can do
actually a couple months ago

793
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,820
never actually probably walk months ago
someone has released in open

794
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,640
a yard we know shield that does data
connections over VHF or UHF radio

795
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,609
all you gotta do is plug it into a radio

796
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:55,410
so getting your license and I don't know
who can prolly is he just had his image

797
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,430
of his license programmed put on Google
Image Search

798
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,609
thanks can arm just one thing

799
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:05,690
about this if you are into privacy in
your very paranoid

800
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,580
anytime you get an amateur radio license
it's a matter of public record where you

801
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,150
live because you are

802
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,359
in fcc identified station if you

803
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:20,380
he you can also get a PO box but there
are some questions

804
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,230
by some people saying that's not a
station operating station

805
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,970
I know a lot of people have done and I
haven't seen anyone actually get caught

806
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,920
for

807
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,920
yes

808
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:43,240
okay so perhaps I'm unfounded

809
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,630
don't know

810
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,720
yes well the advertiser

811
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:58,720
you have question back

812
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,450
that's actually a

813
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,460
think

814
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,589
so I guess are ways around it on if you
want to maintain a poll post office box

815
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:26,230
present

816
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:29,549
go forward harm so

817
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:32,390
getting your license there's three
classes there something called

818
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,058
technician

819
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,750
general an extra technician is full
first-class you would get

820
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,859
is a 35 question exam it's fairly easy
if you have a backgrounder know anything

821
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:43,009
about electronics

822
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:47,359
you know determining what agent we all
thought what a gf region voltage are

823
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,880
you got a good a in how to actually
calculated from each other

824
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,920
you gonna probably about 75 percent the
exam down already

825
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,039
if you pass your technician the next
class up as general as another 35

826
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:58,809
question exam

827
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:02,099
it's little more tougher this time they
talk about different arm

828
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,030
different questions that if you know
designing antennas finding resonant

829
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:06,770
frequencies

830
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,280
you know more more difficult stuff

831
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,869
technicians and finally there's the
extra exam to 50 question exam

832
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:17,069
that is some heavy-duty studying
actually its Eagle

833
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:20,440
you can up probably due in about a month
if you really dedicate some time to it

834
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,380
I they start you know feeding your
charts and arm

835
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,619
you know saying hey find a look at this
chart in Finder you know

836
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:31,150
to show me what exactly is this on this
Gantt chart

837
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,460
r8 arm it's almost a choice

838
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,049
in there's no Morse code requirements
are you doing oh my screen went white

839
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:44,059
I saw that cooperated soon was a line

840
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:48,589
yup

841
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:52,549
okay sectors a fifty best question exam
it slightly more dancers no Morse code

842
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:56,400
requirement are questions persist bass
electro for technician exam questions

843
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,559
this basic electronics

844
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,549
operating procedures rules and
regulations our study guides are

845
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:03,759
available online and at reformat

846
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,450
up my personally recommend Gordon West
WB 60 no way

847
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:11,440
I it's I've used his course is exactly
it's a very good arm

848
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,750
very good system its books are available
on Radio Shack

849
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,730
and I've done that through all of my i
three testing my 15-year

850
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,819
for career yes

851
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:28,819
us

852
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:37,490
the okay well technician allows you arm
50 megahertz in a pop so it's no I veo

853
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:37,910
que

854
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,460
that's actually change since last time I
said this arm

855
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,510
you a get mostly 50 megahertz number for
two free for all you can do whatever you

856
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,670
want up there with an

857
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:52,130
the amateur radio guidelines the you
also have a couple a very small segments

858
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,690
on HFT you can operate

859
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,270
when you start getting in the general
you general has more

860
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,310
a chef segments an extra even has more
each of segments

861
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,029
you're offering for which is about 50
megahertz up still remain the same

862
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:04,950
question back

863
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:11,950
brought that no broadband over power
lines and I'm we've

864
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:18,089
immature radio has been actively
fighting against ppl because

865
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:22,410
you have these wonderful long antennas
which are known as follows: power lines

866
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,629
and you're transmitting data over them
which modulates

867
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,210
in now creates a wonderful Swider
spectrum

868
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:34,599
of radio hash when all OVR HF bands and
even some on the future site so we don't

869
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:35,790
like ppl

870
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,680
and we are happily dancing on every time
some cuny says ppl sucks in like

871
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,109
yes it does %um this

872
00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:51,980
yup arm mica said like the gentleman
from studies classes own question pool

873
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,339
there about 10 times number questions on
the test

874
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:58,630
rotated in every four years technician
class just this 1st to July

875
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,800
rotated into a new four-year from
question for

876
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,349
each test is multiple choice if you
could feel lucky about multiple choice

877
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:07,410
exams go for your immaturity exam

878
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,379
tomorrow 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. 46 arm

879
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,619
tester given in if you don't feel like
doing it tomorrow you wanna study up a

880
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,270
little bit

881
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:19,329
up they're given all over the place by
volunteer examiners usually multiple

882
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:20,010
places

883
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,319
every month on my local our club gives a
test

884
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:26,390
first Saturday of every month him

885
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,980
cost is $14 dollars fifteen dollars

886
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,960
okay ok its multiple choice

887
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,990
you have to be United States citizen I'm
not sure I'm

888
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,510
not that I'm trying to class for you
where your accent but you have no for

889
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,390
the FCC you have to be a US citizen

890
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:48,190
sorry so I i did. I did not know this
until yesterday so

891
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,750
no I thought it was a US citizen that's
what I've been told

892
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:58,450
yes %um yup

893
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,980
okay question

894
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,040
at
