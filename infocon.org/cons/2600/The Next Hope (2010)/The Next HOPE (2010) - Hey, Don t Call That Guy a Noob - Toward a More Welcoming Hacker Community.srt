15
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,420
hacker community can be more welcoming
to new people

16
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,650
for small few words about who I am

17
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,900
on I E live in Chicago I helped start
pumping station 1

18
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,700
which is hackerspace in Chicago on got
involved with that

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,009
December 2008 have been involved with it
ever since

20
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,570
on no more pertinent to the stock I'm
still

21
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,940
fairly new hacker community I

22
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,919
didn't stumble across anything
particularly hatchery and tell

23
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,330
early 2008 on a night of random wiki
pedia

24
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,090
fucking at you know 4 a.m. when I was
law school

25
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,459
four out of my mind let me do
fundraisers America

26
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,540
sir posting on that forum started
talking to people

27
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,000
that and got clued into things 2600
meetings and hacker con

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,160
discussed so far from there on my first
hacker con was actually

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,950
the last hole and you know I've been
going to quite a few ever census going

30
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,459
on meeting

31
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:45,160
people but yeah it's the really only
been around for about two years

32
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,370
ish so being a newbie is

33
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,690
really fresh in my mind few words about
what this talk is

34
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,989
on its 7 ideas to keep in mind in order
to

35
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,080
make hacker community less mysterious
and more open to people who are

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,150
new to it or just trying to figure out
what is the hacker community

37
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,169
where you do it hackers to who are
hackers

38
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,169
what can I do in fact community on its
applicable to hacker group

39
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:22,040
all kinds of hackerspace she is
organizations more informal meetings

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,739
know they're certain pieces myself i
little better in one context

41
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,400
other but it's meant to be a general
framework away if

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,200
thinking approaching 100 do with new
people and bring them

43
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,639
make them feel part of the community no
matter what kind of an organization

44
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,280
that your part if you weren't about what
the stock

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,079
is it as much as it's a free market way
of thinking

46
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,850
I'm not gonna be able to tell you step
by step how to make it more welcoming

47
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,858
you know I can't sit here and say do
this thing

48
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,630
save these words go through all of these
steps

49
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,138
and your arms we going to breed this
much more

50
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,970
welcoming culture i mean it's to
interpersonal sort of thing

51
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,570
and their different ways to approach it
just Center general principles

52
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,350
now me give you a little bit of a road
map out what I'm going to be talking

53
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,100
about

54
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,919
for I can't for small I'm going to talk
about

55
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,448
you and your role in making hacker
community more welcoming place

56
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,960
then I'm going to talk about do you
within your organization to make it more

57
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,198
welcoming to people who are

58
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040
experiencing you experience your
organization for the first time

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,650
I'm gonna talk a little bit about what
you can do outside if your organization

60
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,470
on

61
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,380
units possibly a little more towards
publicity even if is towards

62
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,860
how to run your organization how do your
organization culture

63
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,430
but part love going out and trying to
meet people

64
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,460
and tell me back organization is
conveying

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,530
what the culture is of your organization
and convincing them

66
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,669
K maybe this is a place right feel
welcome maybe this is a place where

67
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,479
my skills would be well you live and I
would have something to gain from coming

68
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:06,760
here

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,400
finally I'm going to talk about special
responsibilities %uh

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,340
organization leadership just because you
know whether you're an officer or

71
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,169
director

72
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,789
were just longtime member that people
look up to you as a leader

73
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,290
you have some special responsibilities
in your in a special role to make people

74
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,880
feel

75
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,790
welcome in your organization for some
gonna talk a little bit about

76
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,300
I guess it seems kinda year to start our
about how to feel more

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,100
how to make other people feel more
welcome by starting with you

78
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,510
but it is an extremely you

79
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,010
it's a process that you have to
internalize it something he did

80
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,250
put yourself in their shoes your all
ambassadors

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,380
the hacker community on hacker community
is global

82
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,360
their hackers everywhere but what new
people experience is going to be very

83
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,570
local you know I wouldn't walk into a
2600 much I walked into a 2600 meeting

84
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,340
in you know

85
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,230
there were some people feel really
welcome in some people that now maybe

86
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,570
not so much ur

87
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,840
walking a any meeting really I'm not
going to go there

88
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,570
think 0 some of these people aren't
being very nice to me

89
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,060
me hackers lender nicer mi vida hackers

90
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,190
in rush are nicer packer somewhere else

91
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,290
I'm not your you to the hacker community
I'm not

92
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,790
somewhere to try and find nicer hackers
I'm going to you

93
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,150
see that local through as know as a
microcosm is an entry point

94
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,170
and if I don't feel comfortable there

95
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,260
I probably wouldn't want to export any
further

96
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,909
and no matter how long you've been
involved you are an ambassador

97
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,090
hacker community I don't care if this is
your first ackerson

98
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,360
for or if you've been around for twenty
years

99
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,180
the point is you're here you're putting
yourself out there

100
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,320
hacker conference and you you're in a
position that you could be talking to

101
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,409
people who were

102
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,950
interested getting involved hacker
community

103
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,870
and you you how you treat them

104
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,100
is going to be crucial on whether they
decide they want to be involved

105
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,450
now become a bit about you were coming
into the community your first

106
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,110
meeting your first event your first
convention on

107
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,850
I'm sure it was really exciting might
nerve-wracking there's all these people

108
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,560
who you don't know

109
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,720
the hackers such a loaded word

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,280
you come in there wow you know where
these people all these people criminals

111
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,790
are these people you know stand up guys

112
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,740
everyone here has the story you for me
it was a little bit

113
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,940
is my scary when I started getting
involved

114
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,980
just like us I was I'm still moscow you
know

115
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,050
we all know how well that turned out I
work in nineteen of by

116
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,080
you know it was my last year law school
i had basically

117
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,090
background check from hell coming up I
just taking

118
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,250
barring part of that the test only

119
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,740
you also have big background check after

120
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,900
left and each the form and tell them
everywhere you ever lived

121
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,860
you know everyone you know everywhere
you working blah blah blah

122
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,460
and its and the last thing I wanted was
after

123
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,790
you're going to school for three years
bust my ass in

124
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,670
you're going into this career detained
because I got mixed up with these

125
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,750
hackers Aaron they thought yeah I didn't
have the right

126
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,080
moral fitness to be a liar and

127
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,320
no I eventually got over that of course
it didn't stop me from

128
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,338
passing the test but it was still just a
really

129
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,219
it was kinda scary and it was I was not
apparent

130
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,360
and you i'm sure i love u have few

131
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,529
when you when you got involved in
packaging you for the first time you may

132
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:45,550
have had concerns like

133
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,479
not you may have just had concerns as in
you these people I don't know you're

134
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,540
using these terms I don't know

135
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,680
on everyone's been involved water I have
they

136
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,050
except me and it's a little
nerve-racking

137
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,589
so you need to keep that in mind when
you people start trying to get involved

138
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:04,600
in your organization

139
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,560
but you all stay why

140
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,720
he stayed in part at least because

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,730
there probably were people that we're
welcoming to you

142
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,250
there how are people who treat you as if
you had something to contribute

143
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,680
and you had something interesting to get
you figured out

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,850
date hacker community is for screw

145
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,880
and people are up to all these different
things you're pushing all kinds Arts and

146
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,930
Technology Center

147
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,329
limit and you wanted to be part of it

148
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:38,600
now how do you make people feel welcome

149
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,769
the need to feel comfortable they need
to feel like there's something they can

150
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:42,730
take from its

151
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,110
making gain any need to feel like
there's something make

152
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,249
kid that Laskar is probably a lot less
cynical

153
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:53,490
are a lot more neglected something they
can take

154
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,800
if you think I'm now I'm gonna go to
this I'm gonna learn skills

155
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,329
AB and C by learning skills isn't

156
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:04,100
all there is it's a lot easier to
feeling gauged if in addition to being

157
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,529
able to learn skills

158
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,740
you feel like you have something to get
because otherwise you go in there and if

159
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,800
you don't think you have something to
give

160
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,149
feel like a leech and few each is
extremely uncomfortable

161
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,079
now we talk a bit about what you can do
from within the organization

162
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,519
3 C's to welcoming organization include
teaching you people

163
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,730
learning from new people and encouraging
other people

164
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,709
in the organization to engage new people

165
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,829
for some talk a little bit about
teaching new people I'm

166
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,850
I've already started on this a little
bit general principles for making people

167
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,370
kam but you everybody has some kind of

168
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,309
reason they get involved in hacker
community and start exploring it

169
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:52,249
and a lot of times it is because they
want to learn a particular skill

170
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:55,129
you maybe they wanna learn something
about computer security maybe they wanna

171
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:55,899
learn something about

172
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,699
art maybe they heard some kind of cool
project that somebody your hackerspace

173
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,110
or somebody in your group has been doing

174
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,480
and they wanna learn from the principles
are technologies behind

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,189
so figure out what they want to learn
and cultivate

176
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:16,480
this can be done formal basis in this
can also be done on an informal basis

177
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,879
I'm formally you can teach classes on a
broad range

178
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,689
topics and teach classes aimed at a
broad range skill levels

179
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:27,610
I mean that's generally good practice
whether you're dealing with people who

180
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,660
are new to the community are not

181
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,100
kiss you even if you've been around for
10 15 20 years their skills

182
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,499
you built-in become very expert at and

183
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,170
there are always new skills to learn
there are always things you don't know

184
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,420
sometimes back to you because you're
doing a new project

185
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,719
on and and the classes

186
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,740
are a good way to you you get people
haven't

187
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,949
you can idea %uh love what sorts of
skills

188
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:57,869
people in your organization hash no they
don't have to be these formal

189
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:01,290
ongoing I'm going to teach a class every
Thursday at 5

190
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,290
yoga classes can be you was informal as
you're giving talks giving presentations

191
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:06,949
you wanna

192
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,689
2600 meeting or something about
something that you're interested in our

193
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,219
project that you're doing

194
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,920
but having that platform to be able to
shoot each other people

195
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,490
the skills that you have is important
and it helps make people feel like

196
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,309
they are learning what they want to
learn when they're getting involved with

197
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,319
your organization

198
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:31,878
not an informal basis it's probably even
more important than having something on

199
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,449
than having a formal basis because sure
you know it's

200
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,980
all I wouldn't say it's easy but its

201
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,569
you can sit down and plan out a schedule
say I'm gonna have these classes at

202
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:43,930
these times

203
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,579
but you're not having classes all of the
times

204
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,199
and your classes are the only avenue for
learning

205
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:54,569
just offer to explain your interests
your project is someone new

206
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,529
walks into the hacker space walks in
your meeting in asks what you're working

207
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:58,509
on

208
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,559
don't seem busy come back later just

209
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,269
talk to me a little bit about it answer
their questions on

210
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,879
no you'll be able to tell them something
that they're interested in that they

211
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,110
want to learn

212
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,779
and they may be able to give you some
reporters to

213
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:16,779
encourage collaboration on projects
collaboration

214
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,410
is really cool because its

215
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,519
it gets and exchange ideas going and

216
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,720
you something really cool can come out
and act on

217
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,999
not only in the Andes informal things
collaboration

218
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:33,240
explaining interesting projects I mean
not only

219
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,529
argue doing teaching but you're also

220
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:39,679
getting to know each other and just
making a more socially

221
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:46,119
comfortable place for people to come in
and feel a part of what you're doing

222
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:49,129
secondly learn from the people

223
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,110
even though their new your organization
they come there with the background

224
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,939
they come there knowing certain things
and you're not only do they come

225
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,540
curious about what they can gain from
the hacker community

226
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,969
on you see a new person coming in and
it's like what can

227
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,879
I take from that what kinda skills are
they bringing into

228
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,240
our space our organization v8

229
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,420
you we may not have here yet

230
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,610
again this can be done formally and
informally

231
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,350
I'm you needed Institute multiple
formats for sharing knowledge and skills

232
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,179
on talks lightning talks classes

233
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,959
on and your something that's and
something as important as far as be able

234
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,929
to give talks or give classes are share
that information

235
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:38,790
is keep that platform as open as
possible

236
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,040
on of course you need to have some kind
of person you'd have some kind of

237
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
setting i mean you need

238
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,998
no what the person is gonna come in and
talked about

239
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:53,470
and you offer them assistance if their
proposal for a class is not point is

240
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,559
refined as you'd like it to be but

241
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,679
the offers there you people need to be
able to come in and

242
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,189
give talks give workshops on skills that
they bring

243
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:09,259
because that will make him feel valuable
it'll make you feel like the other

244
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,819
people at the spacer and the
organization

245
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:15,199
are gaining from their presents which is
just as important

246
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,879
as the new person gaining from your
presence

247
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,829
also on an informal basis ask people
about their skills

248
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:26,649
you when they come in on coming session
1 does something at their meetings that

249
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:27,759
I've always thought his

250
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,499
really cool if somebody know it
beginning in a meeting

251
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:34,670
our presidents like okay who's never
been here before

252
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,040
and everyone has never been to a meeting
at the hackerspace before

253
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,110
they've raised their hands and

254
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,110
no they introduce themselves say who
they are

255
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,600
say what they're interested and learning
at the space

256
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,139
but they can also talk they're also
encouraged to talk about

257
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:55,600
what they already do you what their
hobbies are what their interests are

258
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,119
so that way when your people here not
say oh you know those persons interested

259
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:03,809
radio I have some questions about radio
maybe I'll talk to them

260
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:07,290
and your provides good conversation
starters

261
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,129
and it gets people on putting love not
only expecting

262
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,519
shoe learn things at hackerspace

263
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,069
but also you expecting to you contribute
expecting to you

264
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:22,839
you people know what their background is
ends

265
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,619
can ask questions can get help from the
new people

266
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,639
and again encourage collaboration on
projects

267
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,420
like I was saying before you cannot me
you teach

268
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,299
teaching new person is collaborating on
a project with few things that you now

269
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:41,809
but you can learn from no if you're if
you decide to collaborate on a project

270
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,219
together

271
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,170
that means that the project probably
take some kind of skills

272
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,420
that no wonder the both you haven't want
to learn

273
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,799
and you put you on a more equal footing

274
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,769
finally encourage others to engage new
people

275
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:01,989
no culture welcoming is not just a mask
you put on any time a stranger walks

276
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,110
through the door

277
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,530
it's something that you've got to keep
in mind I'm not why otherwise it's going

278
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,389
to come off

279
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,120
as forced and just

280
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,920
no con a mask you don't want to come off
that way you want it to be something

281
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,329
that's constantly

282
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:22,579
on people's minds and ingrained in the
culture of your organization

283
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,010
on just make sure to express the
importance of teaching and learning

284
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,559
to other members of your organization
and

285
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,580
recognize signs exclusionary behavior

286
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,460
of an exclusionary behavior isn't
necessarily something

287
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,679
people are doing deliberately I mean

288
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,799
I know I'm guilty of it if I'm having a
bad day

289
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,240
go to the space you like I don't wanna
do it people at my do with anything I

290
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,010
just want to sit down on a lot of put my
hand down

291
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,240
and read this book are on this project
do something

292
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,240
but you somebody's been involved in the
hackerspace for wyler known me for a

293
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,990
while

294
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,140
they know it's Nikki on a crank okay by
if somebody comes in who's never been in

295
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,440
a space before

296
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,960
are only been a couple times and doesn't
know me that well and doesn't know the

297
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,140
difference between

298
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,680
Nikki on a bad day Nikki on a good day
on

299
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,660
they may take not and is know me being a
jerk to that maybe

300
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,230
crafted and you again

301
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,920
like you don't wanna be a jerk about
calling people out when they're

302
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,860
not being as friendly as they could be
but you just say

303
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,880
say hey you know what doesn't hurt to
stop for a moment

304
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,180
answer their questions say a few words
you make me feel like

305
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,440
its americanization that they can be a
part of

306
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,690
as opposed to you something where you
have to climb

307
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,840
push your way and and finally

308
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,909
highlights in everybody's interest to
have a welcoming

309
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:54,660
culture I mean something it's the same
few people coming around and doing stuff

310
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,140
picking up release stale and you've gots

311
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,340
not to call hacker community at all a
call the hacker community is to push

312
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,470
ideas to their limits and come up with
new interesting ways

313
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,800
to use things to do you think he and

314
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,860
know a lot of times that impetus for
pushing something new

315
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,160
is know it's going to come from someone
else who comes in with a fresh

316
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,090
perspective

317
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,280
who's not necessarily use you the way

318
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,340
you or your friends or your your people
in your group

319
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,409
are you still looking think on one thing
I wanna talk

320
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,460
on the I wanna talk about here on the
concept love

321
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,790
paying your dues and yeah

322
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,500
there is a kind of respect for people
kinda level of respect for people who

323
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,730
have been around the community for a
long time and that's definitely

324
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,050
well but there's a difference between

325
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,169
that between respect being around for a
long time

326
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,740
and the basic respect love this person
is going to love this person have some

327
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,490
ideas that are worth listening to

328
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,280
and yeah even know the person coming it
hasn't been involved in

329
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,889
Yorker for that long or you may not

330
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,190
have John you a certain field a certain
skill as much as you have

331
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,110
that doesn't mean dates they're not
worth listening to in general

332
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,800
it means that they have something to
learn it means that they may come in

333
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,399
with

334
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,640
other skills that could be useful to you
and it means that

335
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,060
it doesn't mean that you don't have
anything to gain from that person

336
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,879
what you can do for outside the
organization on most surfaces

337
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,260
focused on what you can do you inside
the organization fight

338
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,350
there's a certain level of conveying
your culture

339
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,780
you when you're talking to people who

340
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,050
are outside the organization or when
you're going to some other kind

341
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,889
love no hacker maker artist or whatever
event

342
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,940
on for small making an effort look to
see what other similarly inclined

343
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,150
group gatherings offense there are gray
area and

344
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,420
good on talk to people

345
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,110
bring up your organization in
conversation

346
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,310
and get people interested in it

347
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,440
discuss your projects discussed that
you're working on

348
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,670
personally on but

349
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,420
track try not to make it sound like an I
mean don't

350
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,740
say all you need to come here our group
is so much

351
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,310
ass and then this other that's gonna
sound exclusionary and it's going to

352
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,820
sound dismissive to

353
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,840
what they may already be involved in
what they may be truly love

354
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,830
but now talk to them about their project
showing interest in what they're doing

355
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,899
ask them about what they're doing and
you know find commonalities

356
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,020
what you doing what they do or what they
do and what may be other people

357
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,190
group to you and also don't get caught
up in semantics in terminology

358
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,740
I've heard I'm absolutely sick

359
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,100
love the of our conversations about you
know I

360
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,030
are hacker maker level like labels

361
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,350
and I don't feel like every week

362
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,650
necessary especially they're necessary
to get into

363
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,350
get tied up on especially when you're
just introducing someone in the

364
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,240
organization

365
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,460
I mean you know if your if there are shy
about

366
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,480
oh no they call themselves hackers

367
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,090
don't put the focus on each Werner any
other specific word

368
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,030
put the focus on common interests on
creativity

369
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,340
on you know what they can gain from
being a part of your group and what

370
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,030
you can gain from having them is a part
of your

371
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,600
fine a little bit about public relations
on

372
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,610
don't church don't shy away from media
on there are benefits to you

373
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,860
their view media exposure especially in
the case %uh a hackerspace

374
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,440
on it's a way to reach curious and
talented people

375
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,380
you fair reading the newspaper googling
around there

376
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,600
more likely to find you and it also
dispels dispel the idea

377
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,680
hacker community is something covert

378
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,660
on you may see a news article about you
like wow you know they're

379
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,990
not up and on up to the shady

380
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,610
hackers cybercriminals whatever that I
thought they were they're open

381
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,790
they're talking to people and they're
putting themselves out there

382
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,409
on it makes people more ready to embrace
you contribute your organization

383
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,590
and also you know maybe we'll inform the
future work

384
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,590
%uh media outlets and dispel miss

385
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,879
reporters have about the hacker
community being

386
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,270
scary scary thing now and finally

387
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,639
stand up for yourself you can you tell
her for all you want

388
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,140
summer good lesson you might pull a bad
apple

389
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,660
if you pull a bad apple get stuff wrong
match not a reason

390
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,490
to stop putting yourself out there but
be respectful

391
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,670
crackdown sent a letter to the editor
something in your blog

392
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,760
just do something to you new dispel that
debate

393
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,220
that and you keep your organizational
image

394
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,010
as something is no on the up and up

395
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,340
that is ready to you you embrace new
people and not something to be

396
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,879
afraid of finally can get all bent

397
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,470
the special responsibilities %uh
organizational leaders

398
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,840
for stuff transparency transparency

399
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,820
transparency I cannot stress this enough

400
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,110
mean there are always going to be issues
especially in

401
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,910
any kind of Fair Mall organization the
hackerspace or any kind of

402
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,090
group that puts on events there's gonna
be like

403
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,090
nuts-and-bolts day-to-day tried

404
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,790
that is legitimately best dealt with by
leadership

405
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,800
by elected officers fight

406
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,450
do it openly it helps to fund them if
the Packers

407
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,380
as secretive and also encourages
involvement

408
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,610
you make your Board of Directors
meetings are your membership meetings

409
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,390
open to anyone who wants to look into

410
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,600
on you know any email list state

411
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,080
decisions are being made on on make him

412
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,780
open make readable by people yeah if you
have a board of directors list like

413
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,090
you again going back to example
compensation 1

414
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,510
there is a board of directors email list
in certain business does get down on

415
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,690
that list

416
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,710
but even though it's all me a smarter
people that are allowed to post on it

417
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,920
anyone who wants to can market anyone
who wants to can

418
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,750
read the discussions that are going on
and if they have an issue

419
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,530
they can new email somebody on the board
of directors list personally

420
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,690
or talk about it on the membership
mailing list

421
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,410
or on the public mailing list on
something else is open to a larger

422
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,210
people so there is a level of
transparency for people to

423
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,220
see what's being two-disc being
discussed know about decisions before

424
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,880
they're actually made

425
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,530
and put in their two cents about your

426
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,389
or about where the organization should
be going and

427
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,100
know that's important for new people to
know from the beginning vaped

428
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,250
they have access to you the
decision-making

429
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,780
mechanisms of the organization also

430
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,680
be personally accessible that goes back
to this team that's popped up a couple

431
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,320
times

432
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,300
love now as important as it is to have
form of things in place

433
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,530
its even more important for people to
you

434
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,649
have some kind of informal by

435
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,960
some kind of personal bond with people
who lead the organization

436
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,890
on just be. come to the meetings

437
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,950
be at the space frequently be you answer
your email

438
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,690
be accessible have a membership liaison

439
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,780
on it's nice to have a person who's your
point person for

440
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,410
you answering new people's questions but

441
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,310
now again you can't take that to an
extreme the membership liaison is never

442
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,200
going to be

443
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,150
you owe me Peter who interact with new
people it's good to have a point person

444
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:02,430
for

445
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,780
questions for new giving

446
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,480
giving tours the hackerspace that's the
kind of organization you are

447
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,410
but you need to make sure said all of
the leadership

448
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,710
is accessible and all the leadership is
receptive to the questions and concerns

449
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,540
of new people

450
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,220
finally make it clear that you value
their opinions

451
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,820
on the organization's direction are all
I am so

452
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,490
I'm sick appearing your people dismiss
their own opinions like

453
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,760
oh I'm only new here 0 I'm only an
artist I don't do that text got

454
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,050
blah blah blah as soon as you catch
people saying that

455
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:46,610
need be like no don't say you're only an
artist don't say you're on the newbie

456
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,940
you you're here you're interested in our
organization

457
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,020
and you have valuable things to
contribute and

458
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,000
know if they have a suggestion for how
to run something and it's something that

459
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,630
you've

460
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,750
tried already in it very much has it
worked you know feel free to bring out

461
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,580
feel free to have a dialogue and talk to
them about

462
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,909
now why the like your idea may not quite

463
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,360
what implement fun even then

464
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,540
your listen to rate your open 28 and

465
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,889
you can have a discussion about

466
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,930
know how to how to proceed from there
how did

467
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,120
possibly change things tweak around you
did for Twitter on

468
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,480
date suggested me I'm definitely not
trying to say

469
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,010
every idea put forth by a new person is
automatically better

470
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,180
because it's put forth by a new person
I'm not trying to say that at all

471
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,440
but what I am trying to say is you need
to give

472
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,770
their opinions for the organization's
direction real

473
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,590
some weight you needed consider them
logically consider them fairly

474
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,200
and you let them be part of the
discussion

475
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,510
now one thing and talk little bit about
is

476
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,620
not everybody is going to be a good fit

477
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,520
not all of these new people are going
cue workout

478
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,070
in your organization on some these
people are gonna work out

479
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,480
cuz the hacker community is just not
their thing

480
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,240
maybe they're not know they thought they
were going to find what they were

481
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,750
looking for in your organization and
turns out

482
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,230
they dumped that's okay hacker community

483
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,800
is not for everybody not everybody has

484
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,150
that inquisitive spirit

485
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,450
the hacker community is built around and

486
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,780
you're not everybody actually wants to
be part of a group when they're working

487
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,010
on projects

488
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,900
not OK your people will come in come out
I mean there's really nothing you can

489
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,900
you deal with on the whole she's not
there things that other thing

490
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,160
day no biggie and

491
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,420
that's okay when things get a little for
any

492
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,110
is if these people are not a good fit
because

493
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,140
vere disrupted you there either

494
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,500
verifiable disruptive as n you know they
have

495
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,840
you they're breaking safety rules are
becoming if right to

496
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,910
you up themselves you and others

497
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,550
on you for example if your hackerspace
this comes into play with

498
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,190
you to the tools on maybe they're
causing friction but it might be

499
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,290
subjective

500
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:22,510
like most of the people don't get along
with them but maybe not

501
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,320
all of them or now

502
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,760
they're just difficult percent deal with
third they interrupt people all the time

503
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,860
when they're working on projects

504
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,080
that's that's a little difficult to deal
with and i cant say I have all the

505
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,360
answers are not

506
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,890
if it's something verifiably disruptive
then

507
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,900
you have a purse have a procedure in
place I mean this

508
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,430
if you're you've got a fairly formal
organization you hackerspace or

509
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,090
something

510
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,730
have a grievance procedure in place you
give them a written notice of what

511
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,210
they're doing that violates the rules
give them a

512
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,770
time period to you fix their behavior

513
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,860
on keep everything on paper if it's
verifiably

514
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,370
disrupted on if they're causing friction
but it may be subjective

515
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,720
probably the best way to deal with that
is here

516
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,120
just sit down one-on-one and talk to
them arm

517
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,900
you say K you know your

518
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,290
I'm perfectly happy to talk to you at
some point but could you could you

519
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,110
please

520
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,760
let me check your let me try to get my
project on figure out a time

521
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,980
to if you got time to talk later or you
know

522
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,240
tell them yeah people were getting a
little annoyed by you doing this not me

523
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,120
other

524
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,410
be be tactful about and it's hard

525
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,920
and it hurts to do that but know
sometimes you have to you for the sake

526
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,590
because they may not even realize
they're doing it sometimes you have to

527
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,010
do that now for the sake

528
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,920
love making the organization a
comfortable place for

529
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,710
you for everybody else for all members
and for other new people who may come in

530
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,680
and also no if you have these bad
experiences

531
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,740
don't impart these bad experiences on

532
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,870
every new person who comes and mean just

533
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,850
give them the benefit of the doubt if
they turn out to be a great fit

534
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,410
excellent

535
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,500
if they don't turn out to be a good fit
you cross that bridge when we come to it

536
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,480
but you assume that people are knows who
the people honestly wanna be there

537
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,630
and are there to you get involved in
your organization

538
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,870
and be awesome and be excellent do cool
stuff

539
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,710
until it's proven otherwise

540
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,770
a finger in conclusion discussion how to
build an organization it has to go

541
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,559
beyond recruiting

542
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,770
yeah you know if you got the same like
five people coming to your meeting or

543
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,440
the same like 20 people coming to your
space

544
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,800
the first images of in oh here we needed
me to get people in here

545
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,210
but know beyond that you need to you

546
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,790
beef thoughtful be mindful about making
people stay

547
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:56,180
and remaining focused on the concerns
outlooks new people in mind

548
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,530
will leave the field valuable and
comfortable in your organization from

549
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,240
the first time he became acquainted with
you

550
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,340
on you know your you need to make a good
first impression

551
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,090
and a good first impression involves
being open

552
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,170
being welcoming making them think that
there's something

553
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,120
18 give to the organization as well as
making people feel that there's

554
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,520
something they can learn from your
organization

555
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,050
the questions

556
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,110
I actresses comments grievances

557
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,240
I had some common law professor

558
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,030
and whenever whenever he was finished
with 20 go question

559
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,320
comments grievances

560
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,530
Capcom's and I thought that was really
funny coming from

561
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:49,290
you know eccentric 65-year-old professor
I

562
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,149
I can't see if there's anyone lined up
and yeah okay show

563
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,110
I can't see a thing from here the lights
okay

564
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,460
so i'd at like like to bring up
something bad I think you might have

565
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,320
overlooked or taking for granted

566
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,809
and that the importance of communicating
shared expectations

567
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:10,329
and that when you are bringing new
people in your organization

568
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:14,990
you have I long for self-rule to find
what is acceptable

569
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,780
is an acceptable within your community
and within your space if

570
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,040
an I don't know if you wanna speak
anymore

571
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,759
know that that's definitely a good point
I mean that's probably something

572
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,550
that I your took for granted more than
anything

573
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,879
but mean I don't know how necessary that
is if it's just

574
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,549
if your organization is like in fact
meet up

575
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,980
fight if it is hackerspace sure it is
you and your family organization

576
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,949
that puts on offense and does things
your you need to have a clearly laid out

577
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:49,569
mission you need to have clearly laid
out rules

578
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:53,300
and no thats ads that's absolutely right
they need to be

579
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,520
you're certain things are important
enough to be you in the bylaws are your

580
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,119
corporate

581
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,569
com foundation document some may not

582
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:04,240
you be quite bylaws level but they
should still be

583
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,430
written down they should be static and
they should be in a place like a website

584
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,549
that's accessible for anyone and
everyone to read cuz

585
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,619
yes it gives she gives eighty

586
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,260
known opened shared expectations when
people are coming in

587
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,200
and also no going back to my point about

588
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,210
dealing with people who were difficult
or possibly detrimental

589
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,480
it does give you things you can site
being liked

590
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,990
okay what you're doing violates your
this

591
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,590
that the other brown wall of the
organization

592
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,040
hmmm I would I'd share with that that it
should be on the job

593
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,470
web page as far as mission statement
watcher what the organization is about

594
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,869
but also arm shared values

595
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:55,090
as far as like a value system as far as
I what is it that the organization

596
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,090
values because at Minot fit with them in
another organization

597
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,270
their values to fit with them so what is
it that you're

598
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,530
about as far as with regards to that I
i'm

599
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:11,320
were things a house is that do a
conflict resolution when you have

600
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,000
members who are a little bit more
challenging than others

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,369
and how to go ahead and stepped that up
on

602
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,460
the language that is used and how you
step that up is really important because

603
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,780
you want to keep

604
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,950
that person if possible a

605
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,790
contributing member that community and
if not

606
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,779
dan you 1 I've go ahead disengage

607
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,960
inez constructive ways possible sore

608
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,990
word questions after use how do you go
through that process

609
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,660
what is the language that you found to
be the most useful

610
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,850
and conflict resolution in you

611
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,410
keeping that person a contributing
member the community if not

612
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,560
how to go about having them find other

613
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,580
communities that may be more suitable
for them well if there's a if there's a

614
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,869
difficult person

615
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:07,869
on sorry skull just water

616
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,940
sorry about that on I think what what's

617
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,160
in what's very important when you're
what you need to do is give them

618
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,379
no very clearly very specifically

619
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,030
Wade out reasons why there is a conflict

620
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,250
om I don't remember off hand like know
exactly the words

621
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,370
used but there's there's a written
letter now come to our attention

622
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,790
good we have the following concerns with
you citing

623
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,660
the your behavior specifically as
possible

624
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,799
and connecting match you something

625
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,520
and the you know the rules are the
values written down

626
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,970
on that's important because he know it's
not going to come off as

627
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,870
arbitrary you want as much as possible
them to get a feeling

628
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,359
on okay this is specific they can cite
the reasons why

629
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,520
as opposed to you they're ganging up on
me because they don't like me

630
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,920
that something you want to avoid all at
all cost is coming off

631
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,380
coming off as over there came a funny
because they don't like me

632
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,200
and as far as disengaging

633
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,140
on I mean honestly I'm honestly not sure

634
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,410
I mean it's never it's never got to that
point

635
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,529
where we've had it's you forcibly

636
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,460
disengage someone from your family

637
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,140
kick them out the space on when we've
told them

638
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,600
that they've been breaking certain rules
OMF

639
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,980
you know sometimes though sometimes I'll
clean up her act

640
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,560
but now sometimes dole few on cocktail
feel extremely uncomfortable the week on

641
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,140
the mound on their behavior

642
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,950
and don't even know how and I mean that
sounds

643
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:04,300
that sounds bad by its you know that
that's what happened

644
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,690
and know if they're uncomfortable with
being call now

645
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,910
on doing things that violate the

646
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:16,210
terms of the space then you maybe it's
probably better in the long run

647
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,270
day didn't end up staying in the group I
mean

648
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,740
as far as finding other things that
maybe

649
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,070
a better fit I don't know if that's
necessarily with and

650
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:30,070
disco I love the organization's
leadership i mean you're not necessarily

651
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,040
like

652
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,830
I yellow pages for other similar
organizations have someone asked me you

653
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:39,430
know 11 hair there any other
organizations that do this that or the

654
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,690
other I'd be perfectly happy to tell
them

655
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,730
but I don't know if that's necessarily
something we we deal with is an

656
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,500
organization like up to someone and be
like

657
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,760
an offer for a good fit here maybe you
could be a good fit Tupac's

658
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,760
sorry can't see if anyone of a sign up
for questions I can't say anything

659
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,930
okay face

660
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,960
so arm one thing with it

661
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,470
I guess I see

662
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:17,480
Carson leave but arm is rarely spoken of

663
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,780
is arm future gender imbalance in

664
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,000
the vast majority of hackers anything

665
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,480
arm do you have any eighty years

666
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,520
concerns et cetera regarding that

667
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,660
arm now it's it's definitely a concern I
mean I've

668
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,950
then in the minority and well pretty
much

669
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,580
any hacker event that I've ever gone to
you

670
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,020
and now mine my feelings on that would
be

671
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,030
your people people do need to be
conscious of that people need to you

672
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,060
you make it a culture I love not

673
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,420
now incorporating sexist talk sexist
actions

674
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,800
didn't you v you into their behavior at
the space

675
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,920
they need to come in and now assume that

676
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,300
someone coming in regardless of gender
is has something to contribute

677
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,470
has no good ideas for the space

678
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:21,090
and you know Nazi woman come in it's
like she's probably just to see how

679
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,980
you're looking for

680
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,010
guy on you people just need to be

681
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,700
cut people need to be conscious on on
gender blind honestly

682
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,510
and the way they look at and assess new
people coming in and

683
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,120
you stop and think okay is how i'm
behaving

684
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,770
going to make you man women

685
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,880
anybody feel welcome in open it space

686
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,880
oh yeah

687
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,850
no I'm definitely not I'm definitely not
saying there's a difference between

688
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,960
sexist language in crash language

689
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,950
I don't have a problem with I way

690
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,600
you know I'm you're given a talking to
Connor anything but you know you talk to

691
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,850
me

692
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,900
casual conversation you know your shady
fucker fly outta my mouth a mile a

693
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,940
minute

694
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,580
but there is no difference between Matt
and you now

695
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,080
hey look at that time on her

696
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,380
you know one is tau

697
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,060
without him last night I

698
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,340
for

699
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,090
me I'm I'm definitely not saying that
you know casual or even

700
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,400
crashing wage is a bad thing because you
I feel more comfortable in that

701
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,540
situation to

702
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,540
although now I know that some don't
bonnet

703
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,390
known being fair being very careful
about

704
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,779
arm you gender loaded or

705
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,130
you sexually explicit language is

706
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,810
probably a good thing

707
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:15,810
and the questions

708
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,660
this is all well and good and I
understand where you're coming from

709
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,480
courage to a hackerspace environment and

710
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,559
really would support that but

711
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,180
being the sea 2600 conference having
2600 meanings

712
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,669
and for myself having Ryan probably 2600
meetings at

713
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:44,009
for five different cities they're still
there

714
00:43:44,009 --> 00:43:47,640
wall we have to put up because we don't
know showing up

715
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,920
having had to deal with certain

716
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,940
leo's showing up that just graduated
from the Academy trying to make a name

717
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,720
for themselves right off the bat

718
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,789
by busting some evil hack or I

719
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:06,249
that was a direct quote pic

720
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:10,349
its it can also depends on the
environment that you're in

721
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:14,220
and who which getting exposed to

722
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,269
what's going on well yeah I mean there's
definitely enough

723
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:22,190
ubat 2600 meeting a hackerspace

724
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,009
well was in a meeting a hackerspace

725
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:29,329
or anything else I'm not saying that

726
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:33,079
you don't have to hide your I'm not
saying that you don't have to have your

727
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:33,630
guard up

728
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,279
I mean yet there could be unsavory fed
like characters walking into a 2600

729
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:39,940
meeting

730
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,230
or hackerspace there could be unsavory
non-fat like characters walking into you

731
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,859
your meeting her hackerspace I mean we
had a guy

732
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:53,558
show up to you and one or two far
formation meetings for coming station

733
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:56,029
one menu he came in and was just

734
00:44:56,029 --> 00:45:01,759
of the back pushy about oh you know you
need to run things this way you need to

735
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:05,039
be a politically charged organization
it's your duty to do so

736
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,150
blah blah blah and you know we

737
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,299
disagreed we disagreed with him and told
him so in no uncertain terms

738
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:16,599
but did it in a respectful manner I mean

739
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,940
there's a difference between on being

740
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,289
between being welcoming and you know
thinking that

741
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:26,660
know everybody's gonna fit in your
thinking that nobody is a threat

742
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,598
but what's important I think being a
2600 meeting

743
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:33,730
or a hackerspace or anything ask is

744
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:38,819
to you no give the find out find out
what you can about them

745
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,200
but now give them the benefit of the
doubt if you find out pretty quickly

746
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,349
yeah I know he's a he's a fat and you
don't really wanna

747
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:50,579
you know talk to him and he's up to no
good going to be disruptive

748
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,579
yeah proceed from there but

749
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,599
don't assume that everybody walking in
is gonna be

750
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,210
now offender is gonna be a threat to
your organization you

751
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,160
given a fair shake. find out what their
find out what their deal is first care

752
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,259
enough to do that 'em

753
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:12,569
I just want to add into in addition to
that involve the net tax base in in like

754
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:13,940
you can also involved in now

755
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,069
some more activist political type stuff
and when things on the political side

756
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:19,819
things we don't see so much in
hackerspace I things is this concert up

757
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,680
security culture

758
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,200
where there is some very worser

759
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,900
have developed sir pretty clear
guidelines on how to deal with the

760
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,960
social situations where you do things
like

761
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,809
Tom be very clear that unites in
community for getting people about the

762
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:35,289
things that they don't miss it when we
were measuring too much information the

763
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,859
first place he said it was very
assertive in advance at a at a cultural

764
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:38,470
level

765
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,630
so if make some people in your group
doing things that are

766
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,509
you know grey hat back at tech stuff or
whenever the context is

767
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:49,849
you know you make sure you keep that
away and and down

768
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:53,539
disorder as a cultural thing don't
expose those things and then

769
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:56,880
with people coming in wanna get involved
in that there's sort of processes that

770
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,640
that you can see happening in more
release that I see happening

771
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,339
activists areas is really something
where 2600 group coming from Zazzle

772
00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:07,460
obviously the similarities but is the
concept that building in security

773
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,650
culture can get around a lot of those
problems as well

774
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,539
I think just you know the word that

775
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,910
that other cultures and agriculture's
were involved and have them

776
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:21,819
these problems we can learn from them as
well no

777
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:25,140
well it's an interesting point I mean
talking about things as

778
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,328
as simple as a an ambush on Flickr
bookstore where is a radical bookstore

779
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:28,960
and you know

780
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,529
people there of other projects and you
want people coming in volunteered

781
00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:33,269
because they like

782
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:36,089
you know involved in the community
bookstores like that you don't want them

783
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,400
to necessarily get involved in

784
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:44,299
in other things things like that so yeah

785
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:48,239
things I find interesting hackerspace
where I live

786
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,039
best is in the virtual discuss our the
virtual hackerspace

787
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,470
for me it's IRC channels that's weird
and

788
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:58,549
you know I side the hackerspace in some
I find it interesting you know for

789
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:59,269
myself

790
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:03,019
I I am work best in my own my head so

791
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:08,309
UN where I bounced my ball of that
virtual wallets and IRC channels and a

792
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:09,089
half years

793
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:12,420
everyone in this room many bus early
years in our respective communities

794
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,509
technically I mean

795
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:17,250
very few of us here followers cell when
I see

796
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,739
news like to go back to the top if
you're talking I see group work entire

797
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:21,650
see channels

798
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:26,809
you know what I see my peers going I try
to help them but I I am

799
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:32,460
I am mace a I'm in the minority when I
find that a lot of people are doing is

800
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,710
RTFM people are click ish

801
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,819
they try to socially engineer themselves
into the group

802
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:42,369
just by trying to make small talk they
failed miserably by the way

803
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:46,390
also FF unfortunate enough to be in a
bed

804
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,460
mean I can name a couple they just get
automatically banned even if the night

805
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,900
you know I don't know who you are but
you're in a bad domain show on you

806
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,559
you know bad luck for you anyway the
point is I'm just trying to get across

807
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,130
Eastern how not to

808
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,970
label people is nudes and to keep them
involved in the community

809
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:07,309
very difficult because very few people
will goal to the hackerspace first

810
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:10,950
if they're interested in the technology
the IRC channel first

811
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,559
and that's where they'll get turned off
because when they walk in CRC channel

812
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,400
and they get

813
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,589
talk down to an RTF m2m make it

814
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:23,349
you know completely isolated and they
find they can't even approach that

815
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:27,799
entrance ramp onto you know a person to
speak to about anything

816
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:31,500
what they'll just get it may be a couple
from the people for them a couple links

817
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,900
you know say just look here look there
they just cant get themselves in that

818
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,480
rotating revolving door of people just
walking and walking out

819
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,480
arm I find it that that virtual
hackerspace

820
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,269
in the IRC channels where most of us
live our quote the silent majority

821
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:49,180
arm and that is where also i think is
the most unfriendly place

822
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,489
I have of course I'm I'm in the industry
a long time but I i've cut mighty so I

823
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:57,410
have my friends I mean my little crew on
my next find makes me happy but I feel

824
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,269
really bad for everyone else

825
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:02,670
an I I was hoping you would address that
I know you didn't but

826
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:07,640
that's the hackerspace i think is much
more also important that's my opinion

827
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,150
Vandiver decried the real hacker space
because I think that

828
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,369
it's the people who already succeeded in
the virtual hackerspace are trying to

829
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:18,029
take it to the next level and end up in
the real hackerspace

830
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:21,900
I think the real place for us to be more
inclusive

831
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,250
as leaders respectively in our
communities and icp-aes I mean

832
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,940
geographic communities

833
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,630
to help those who are trying media
interested in me and i wanna get scared

834
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,559
away

835
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:35,190
is actually the trial will be a little
bit more closer perhaps less click ish

836
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,390
in a little more mature

837
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,690
and I find that severely lacking on
freenode

838
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:45,599
and on 2600 and II to add I'd done it a
couple times myself but that's just my

839
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,410
opinion

840
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,710
I think I was just take it for what it's
worth I'm sorry if I offended anybody

841
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,579
%uh you make you make a really good
point they're actually I mean I was

842
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:58,329
focusing on real-life meet space if you
will on the top but

843
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:01,390
no I spend it on a time on IRC is well
on

844
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,009
on freenode on 2609 on more

845
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:08,690
now IRC rooms and I can count and now
they're is

846
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,980
there is a lot I like they see a new
person walking into the router minutes

847
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,940
late due to hell

848
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,769
this I've never seen them before and no
I

849
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:20,469
you are you are absolutely right the
people need to be

850
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:24,799
more welcoming to new people on now on
IRC

851
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:28,960
or forums on the internet I mean it's
really easy to be a total

852
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,400
asshat online cuz you you're not

853
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,099
you're not paying out there they can you
reach through the computer and punch you

854
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:38,180
if they get pissed off at you so it's

855
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,519
really easy fights now you're probably
going to turn you from week

856
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:46,269
you're gonna turn off a lot of people
who were you knew when interested in

857
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,059
trying to delve and

858
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,369
by the you re putting them on IRC

859
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:55,650
your you're absolutely right I would
just encourage anyone is a saying just

860
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,319
simply be a little bit more from leakers
I personally feel really bad for the

861
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:03,058
guys who just trying to learn something
China ask couple questions and Fink

862
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:06,190
they're gonna get that benevolent tech
guy who's going to answer the question

863
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,829
instead again if you are a fan or they
just simply just get a

864
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:14,250
RTFM Hypercom I just seen are all too
often it bothers me and soul

865
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,349
in a in the end it talk at this context
I just wanted it you know

866
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:20,579
now and get your thoughts on a bit just
take opportunity to mention except or

867
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:23,940
all over I say yes leaders in our
respective channels

868
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,109
should probably just got a little extra
thought maybe speak to our own

869
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:31,130
friends about it just on the back of

870
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,000
quick a comment about just had another
comment um

871
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,859
not remember that not with the RTFM
contradict me nuts because

872
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:43,210
everybody is the first 1000 learning and
not everyone learns best by reading

873
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:48,630
so like personally for me learn I can
learn by reading but it's a lot more

874
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,329
for rewarding to me to learn by asking
questions and doing in working with the

875
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:54,319
demand for something so that

876
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,558
just the RTFM culture is really really
negative to those people who don't learn

877
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,719
best by reading and it's really rough on
those people

878
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:05,839
but what i was gonna say is combating to
the thing about the sexism earlier is

879
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,578
that to also be aware it was
orientations

880
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:12,750
because you know if I go to a place and
people like let's shoot game where you

881
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:17,369
know your soldiers a faggot blahblahblah
I would be to return of a not come back

882
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:20,759
because it's like you know there are gay
hackers and it's very important to you

883
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:23,589
know not use that word as a put-down

884
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:27,259
yeah absolutely agree on you
ornamentation

885
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:31,430
at that's another thing and that's
another kind of language that I think

886
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,410
should be avoided

887
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,410
make people feel welcome his one it's
just

888
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:39,730
not good practice to call bad things
Gary whatever but

889
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:43,799
it is going to make people feel
unwelcome

890
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:48,000
actually wonders to the stuff

891
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,109
I wanted to remind all the new people
that your much less likely getting RTFM

892
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:56,380
if you demonstrate you actually have
done some research ask your question

893
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,579
may not be able to find the answer if
you can say

894
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:04,449
I try to hear it right there and I put
some level fun into it

895
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:08,049
then you can ask mortality question call
you better answer

896
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:13,680
and for those it are tempted to tell
people RTFM

897
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,579
give them the right things to go
research instead of just on

898
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:23,809
researcher and I think that those who
can learn by research will learn better

899
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:27,799
yeah I know thats that's true I mean you
need to you

900
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:31,650
time RTFM isn't going to do anything on

901
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,630
tell them tell them where the manual is
maybe give them a link to something to

902
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:36,099
read

903
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:39,930
and you know it's good it's definitely
good to act to

904
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,819
do research first NASCAR ask more
intelligent question

905
00:54:43,819 --> 00:54:46,969
but new even if someone that comes in
and asks a fairly

906
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:52,019
you have a question like your response
respond maybe responded another question

907
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:56,299
in turn you know like what have you done
early what more specifically do you want

908
00:54:56,299 --> 00:55:00,049
to do you want to know about like near
near on the topic

909
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:04,140
what level to you believe should hold
new people accountable

910
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,410
for making that first effort beyond just

911
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,690
simply s question arm

912
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:15,150
now I think its I think I think it's
definitely a new person's responsibility

913
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,829
to you

914
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:20,420
no they come in and they say they're
interested in you learning

915
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,579
act in learning XY and z. I mean if

916
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:27,869
their after interested in learning and
I'm

917
00:55:27,869 --> 00:55:30,949
you know kind of and have expecting that
they've

918
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:34,199
you at least John you track tried to do
a little bit

919
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:39,559
love new reading you're talking to
people or starting to suss out the topic

920
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:43,039
but now honestly I don't fold

921
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,660
like I don't hold them to fax ha I don't
for them that high of a standard

922
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,558
especially when they're just starting
out just because

923
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,130
you maybe they are not process if
figuring out if they're interested in it

924
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:53,690
and

925
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:57,819
just something out the topic and you
maybe they do

926
00:55:57,819 --> 00:56:01,380
if they learn best by reading they can
easily do not own their own if they

927
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,380
learn best by talking to people

928
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,170
maybe they're trying to find that person
or those people to talk to you

929
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:11,500
you to mentor them are to give them you
even just a bird's eye view of this

930
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,809
thing that they realized they might be
interested in so

931
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:21,219
now I I find it really hard to I find it
really hard to hold it against someone

932
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:26,180
that they you don't now anything yet
about a certain topic sign a whole lot I

933
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,949
don't know anything about it

934
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:34,430
am moreover comment and a question

935
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:38,349
although I am extremely respectful every
culture

936
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,390
and orientation and everything out there
I have

937
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,259
great respect for everything about it I
gotta say a couple things because I I

938
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:46,750
gotta be honest here

939
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,029
on a start really quickly but just
asking a question

940
00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:53,640
how is copper wire invented two Jews on
the same penny

941
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,808
I and you wish I can tell a joke

942
00:56:56,809 --> 00:57:01,140
okay look let me be very blunt let me be
very honest

943
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:05,589
you're in a hacker world hacker world is
semi survival of the fittest

944
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:10,049
if you can't take a joke go find another
world

945
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:13,140
there are their

946
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,109
sorry there are abuse and nasty and
that's wrong

947
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:20,230
I agree with you on a per cent but a
joke is a joke

948
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,829
deal

949
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:30,829
I'll have to its ok welcome

950
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,220
I'm not I'm not some this welcoming
thinks

951
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,550
I'm saying respected enjoy but I'm also
saying

952
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,609
understand that sometimes people make a
joke in there were only two jewish they

953
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:43,259
won't know you're gay they won't know
whatever

954
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,890
okay so if you feel upset then taken a
sign in to him looking to do that upset

955
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,529
by Paul and I say you know did that
upset him

956
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,910
you know it I honestly didn't mean to
upset me and if you did we need to talk

957
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,410
different pretty potentially buy the
building but it upset me

958
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:04,170
that's cool that's fine okay but i mean
there's an extent of their there's

959
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,420
there's a level to which

960
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,300
you don't need to be politically correct
and then this extent to which you do

961
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:15,300
need to be

962
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:35,300
to so looking forward to next year re
planning on giving the talk

963
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,960
hope again home and and so

964
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,640
you I'd like to see this turn into a
panel discussion

965
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,650
to get more ideas from your community

966
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:50,590
because what works for you doesn't work
for him which

967
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:55,080
doesn't work for him which doesn't you

discussion on this would be very

970
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:06,610
