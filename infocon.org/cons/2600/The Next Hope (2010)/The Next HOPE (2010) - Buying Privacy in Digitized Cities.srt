1
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,170
people filled in my name's on our Seder

2
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,779
and I'm gonna talk a bit about
surveillance today I'm

3
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:30,050
and the way that's films affects our
lives there are a lot of

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,090
different kinds have surveillance that
we interact with and a modern city

5
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,250
com we've been watching people for a
very long time

6
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,500
and every time we invent a new form of
media or new technology

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,989
we also eventually invent a new kind of
surveillance that goes along with that

8
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:46,890
technology

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,059
the list you see here a surveillance
technologies is

10
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,059
almost necessarily incomplete

11
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:08,500
so to make this a bit more real let's
take a minute

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,070
to look at how many ways an average city
dweller

13
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,940
interacts with surveillance and
monitoring systems and assertive

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,140
prototypical City

15
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,360
apps so

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,520
you wake up an eternal lights and a
smart electric meter notes the change in

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,220
power use

18
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,520
when you make a coffee check your
webmail your ISP screens in stores on

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,360
the web traffic

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,680
reply to an email and the intelligence
agencies stores it

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,080
and keyword matches: the contents your
mail provider analyzes the information

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,330
and salsa to an ad company you turn on
your phone

23
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,940
and the registers your location within
an online database the phone company

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,950
also recorded

25
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,960
the intelligence agency cross-references
the two new text messages that come in

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,300
with the email you just sent

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,830
you take a shower and the gas and water
meters not the usage

28
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,569
you get dressed and get on some way to
go to work along the way

29
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,000
you appear on camera is run by our
landlord the transit agency

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,330
several nearby merchants the police and
traffic agency

31
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,690
the time you swipe your card to enter
the subway is stored

32
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,008
along with your identity arm

33
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,560
while you're on the platform you get a
call from her boss the numbers

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,579
time and duration a log for billing use
and possible law enforcement use

35
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:22,579
the phone company doesn't capture the
voice data but the company you work for

36
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,150
May captured on his and

37
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,709
and this the microphone attached the
camera you're standing under might also

38
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:28,600
captured

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,959
the train arise anyone fine air quality
monitoring box to get on

40
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,750
arm as the train leaves the station the
transitory

41
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,700
authority tracks the trends movement and
onboard cameras record you

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,500
when you walk out the destination of
your journey might be recorded near

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,049
metro card with some systems

44
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,829
are the turnstile also implements the
number of people leaving the station in

45
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,799
this time period

46
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,280
on the way into the office in addition
to passing through the vision a couple

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,370
dozen more cameras

48
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,370
you've stopped by Chris I'm you have a
credit card

49
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,000
and transactions recorded by the
merchant the credit card processor

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,700
the credit card company and issuing bank
the last three of them

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,709
all run it through fraud detection
systems and cellmark data to marketers

52
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,489
your mother registers are changing
location as you walk past a weather

53
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:15,130
station

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,989
the radio signal from your phone is
evaluated by an RF threat detection

55
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,290
system run by the National Security
Agency

56
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,660
om a cab with its own video system and

57
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,850
GPS tracker tries by and played in face
detection systems

58
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,228
recognize the car and the driver
separately it backfires

59
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,299
and its on-board data collection system
for two missions capture a whole buncha

60
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,190
data from that

61
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,329
a nearby gunshot detecting microphone
evaluates that noise and throws it out

62
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,609
as false positive

63
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,820
the car itself is also logging engine
data and speed data

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,220
plus acceleration which the police
insurance companies can use in the event

65
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,320
of an accident

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,620
it drives over a temporary traffic load
sensor

67
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,630
and passed a red light camera and less
obviously

68
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,030
passed a chemical sniffer looking for
explosive residue you walk into your

69
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,600
office

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,060
through an alarm door and pass to
Wendover the glass break detector

71
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,549
and also passed a huge rise in smoke
detector you shop in another camera see

72
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,549
swipe your card

73
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,269
to get him which is locked as is the
time you log into your computer

74
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,540
you load up a web page and that check
for corporate web filter

75
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,900
even awake less than two hours half a
dozen government agencies a log

76
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,000
information about you

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,290
possibly Ste three times as many private
organizations

78
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:35,120
so now that we have some idea the scope
at the issue

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,009
and just how pervasive it is let's take
a step back

80
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,009
and look at some other structural issues
around surveillance

81
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,840
to better understand its position within
this larger socio-economic friend wanna

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,430
the distinct complications

83
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,180
looking at surveillance work is the same
property of digital information

84
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,800
that makes it fundamentally a more
useful median for its intended purpose

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,110
it can be really easily retransmitted an
aggregated

86
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,610
the physical installation of sensors is
obvious

87
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,150
invisible but once those sensors exist
repurchasing that data can be done much

88
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,490
much less visibly

89
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,110
for instance wanna municipalities sides
to install a camera system

90
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,740
any first presented as a traffic camera
theoretically on the in place to watch

91
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,830
for accidents

92
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,500
and to review traffic levels however the
police very quickly shift the same

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,800
traffic cameras

94
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,250
over to more general use this has been
true Cincy TV

95
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,620
CCTV was installed anywhere on the very
first system in Munich in 1958

96
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,560
was originally a traffic camera system
that was used for general police work

97
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,440
within a couple of years

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,100
the pattern repeat itself from many
different technologies are nobel some

99
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,640
occasion tracking is a great example
here

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,599
originally in the US the e911 location
reporting feature

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,660
was only designed to let emergency
operators know where people were calling

102
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,290
from

103
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,640
because this is in an increasing problem
that they were having people would call

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,940
up with cell phones

105
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,760
and it wouldn't know where to send the
ambulance to om

106
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,810
however police intelligence agencies
rapidly rapidly adopted

107
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,130
last year y nada the four major US
carriers

108
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,420
reported more than 8 million cellphone
location data requests

109
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:20,050
just for GPS data not for tower base
location data that's much more comment

110
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,960
not for 911 calls not for intelligence
agency operations not for civil lawsuits

111
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,210
just from the police

112
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,730
and that's just one carrier so

113
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,970
the largest forms above secondary use

114
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,430
even larger than that kind of thing
involve sharing and buying and selling

115
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,580
data

116
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,090
this is a pretty fundamental feature as
modern society

117
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,160
on the very concept of a credit rating

118
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,540
is based on company sharing financial
information with each other

119
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,470
through mediating rating agencies this
happens both for consumers and for large

120
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,830
enterprises

121
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,510
the same thing is now happening with
other less clear-cut information

122
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,450
like the results have data profiling
performed by marketing for firms

123
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,010
an amazing amount of information is
included in these profiles

124
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,360
arm down to stuff like new data reported
by voice stress analysis systems

125
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,810
that are built into interactive voice
response systems

126
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,500
so when you call up some kind of thing
and it says you know oh say

127
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,700
operator for operator it rose to figure
out what kind of mood you're in

128
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,610
and that affect how your car gets routed
you know sometimes

129
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,820
if there's a menu system that is
recognizing you and you just start

130
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,389
screaming at it

131
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,880
it'll transfer you to an operator even
though I didn't recognize anything

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,570
but it also takes a note as who you are
when two figures that out in ties into

133
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,520
account data

134
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,370
and a lot of times that stuff sticks
around on those records and then gets

135
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,940
aggregated

136
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,480
so you know the and this can include
stuff so you know you have a

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,150
you have a marking profile and says oh
the last time you can last five times

138
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,090
you called your credit card company has
been really upset

139
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,620
like more much more so than their
average users are

140
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,130
arm in much the world is kinda dating
clearinghouses are

141
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,180
really largely unregulated

142
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,480
similar things exist within the state in
the past 10 years especially

143
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,699
governments have been building large
interagency databases in the cloud

144
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,860
all sorts of information not just about
convicted criminals

145
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,540
national intelligence agencies have also
been buying have taken to

146
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,139
combine the data from civilian
clearinghouses

147
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,240
they can't economically collect all that
data on their own

148
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,610
but that also means that they can get
around the rules are on

149
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,199
who they can watch and what kind of data
they can collect

150
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:39,659
but that means that they get data that
was never vetted for intelligence use

151
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,610
was never intended for that kind is

152
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,670
on you for the kinda rules against
pushed into

153
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,889
like this voice stress systems

154
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:53,060
these kinds of data sales and really the
entire secondary you system

155
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,070
are driven by among lot of other things
but primarily driven by the expensive

156
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,750
gathering this data

157
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,279
once a city is spend millions and
millions of dollars on a CCTV system

158
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,110
there's immense pressure on the sea to
make the most of that investment

159
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,430
this leads to second uses that data
being set up

160
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,459
the secondary uses may not have much if
any direct benefit to the general

161
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:15,440
population

162
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,790
but the show that the city is making the
most of its investment you know a lot of

163
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,620
the time these things are done

164
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,699
either for internal City political
reasons I'll be really convenient if we

165
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:25,620
had this

166
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,029
or they're just done to literally you
know show the voters oh well we spend

167
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,510
all this money to look it's being used
for

168
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,990
all these things whether or not anyone
actually wants that it still gets the

169
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,660
message through

170
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,779
a similar pressure exists in the
commercial world where companies that

171
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,089
have accumulated a turf a legitimate
primary business purposes

172
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,899
look for ways to defray the cost of all
that data accumulation this is one of

173
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,339
the big things that happened

174
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,610
with credit card companies arm

175
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,949
you know that now we have this huge
database well

176
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,860
how can we make money on that huge
database and then they start selling it

177
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,399
similar pressures are resulting in a lot
as public-private cooperation is where

178
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,160
you get

179
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,579
networks have public and private cameras
going together that kind of thing

180
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,149
or the places where intelligence
agencies are buying databases

181
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,660
from the from the marketers

182
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,550
the same pressures that and a on that
that cause a second use

183
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,569
end up being behind a lot of the cases
where the government uses surveillance

184
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,709
abusively

185
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:26,949
if you have the opportunity to

186
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,040
do this sort of thing you know if you
have the opportunity to abuse a

187
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,469
surveillance system

188
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,869
that will happen simply because outlets
easy why not do it

189
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:38,899
it's really pretty rare the government
says you have so-called free countries

190
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:39,999
free nations

191
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,439
specifically go either way to build
systems to track for instance political

192
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,199
dissidents

193
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:49,329
thats really kind of hard to justify few
actually build the system with that in

194
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,240
mind

195
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,449
however it's a regular regular
occurrence the systems that are bill for

196
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:55,189
some legal purpose

197
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:58,639
whether they're wiretap systems with
insufficient safeguards

198
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,819
databases that are only intended to
track down criminals et cetera

199
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:06,050
are used to track and to monitor and
harass

200
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,089
dissidents and both political and even
personal enemies

201
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,679
the more global a systems reached the
more damage it can do

202
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,589
more easily that data can flow around
through a system

203
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,059
the harder it is to ensure their
appropriate controls on all levels

204
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:25,689
the progress at the technology its
surveillance is directly at odds with

205
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,290
the prevention of abuse

206
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:33,599
even assuming that surveillance is good
in the first place

207
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,740
so one of the other issues is

208
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,550
the quality of surveillance verses
aggregation of data

209
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,839
there's a large class initiatives that
either

210
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,220
do invade people's privacy or the
potential to do so

211
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,800
that are not based on gathering you did
at the just based on making

212
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,089
data which already exists more available
arm

213
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,949
even if its you know available in some
form that doesn't mean

214
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:03,939
that its easy to get the argument is
that there's no actual change in how

215
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,629
much privacy someone has

216
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,429
when this happens but that's pretty
obviously false

217
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,490
privacy isn't an absolute binary
function

218
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,519
it's a Grady Asian across types of
information across different announcer

219
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,920
data that are available

220
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,139
and most specifically across ease of
access

221
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,480
changing any these has an immediate and
concrete effect on

222
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,639
individual privacy this alone assuming
that we say

223
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,899
that violating someone's privacy is an
evil action that there is a direct

224
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,379
social harm their

225
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,839
kind of puts a like Google's claims to
not be evil I mean

226
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,850
no matter how much good they've done in
other cases they have a very very shaky

227
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,610
record on personal privacy

228
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,629
and they've done more than any other
single corporation

229
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:52,189
to make all kinds of data regardless if
you know what its use for what it is

230
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,829
anything like that easily available

231
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,290
so when you get things like aggregation
and data profiling stuff gets even more

232
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,618
complicated

233
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:05,059
when companies are agencies make an
effort to collect large swaths

234
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,189
informations

235
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:09,769
from both public and private sources and
create a profile on it

236
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:13,629
they get a lot more information out at
that after its been processed

237
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,600
than just what they captured they can do
things like say well

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,689
in ninety-five percent of the cases
where we saw

239
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:25,339
this pattern of purchases it meant that
someone had just lost their job

240
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:28,619
now chances are maybe you are in that
five percent

241
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:32,480
but they can just simply say well you
know this is probably what that means

242
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,970
small fairly trace amounts of data can
be statistically telling to really

243
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,939
surprisingly

244
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:42,889
to her a really surprising degree
economies of scale help this process a

245
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,660
lot

246
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,170
both you need economy of scale to build
out the system and get the database that

247
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,069
you're doing your analysis from

248
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:53,860
but also to build a system like that to
investigate one person

249
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,089
would be really for renders the
expensive there's no way

250
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,170
you can justify spending a hundred
million dollars

251
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,720
even if you're the NSA to investigate a
single person

252
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,309
however a hundred million dollars to
investigate a hundred million people

253
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:11,679
okay sure why not

254
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,249
this difference and economies of scale
is one of the reasons why the future

255
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,300
that we all go along with having no
privacy is pretty fundamentally

256
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,389
unworkable

257
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,660
even assuming there isn't really an
intrinsic need for privacy

258
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,850
it doesn't result in the Equality that
it's being sold as resulting in

259
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,059
differential resources create a power
dynamic in who can know what

260
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,660
if the results of all those data
profiling systems Republic

261
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,209
then there might be an argument but
they're not there's no reason and

262
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,869
there's no way to compel some marketing
firm

263
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:45,829
to release all the data profiles that
they just spent all this money on

264
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:49,279
and unless that information is public
you don't actually have that kinda

265
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,879
quality of privacy

266
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,379
be on that organizational privacy and
personal privacy

267
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:59,549
are completely different things you can
hurt a corporation monetarily when you

268
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,629
leaked data

269
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:04,009
about you know what's going on
internally that kinda thing

270
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:07,360
but that doesn't cause psychological
harm you cannot

271
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,549
heard a corporation's feelings om

272
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:14,879
the legal systems also really good at
taking care of corporations

273
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,089
the kinds of privacy the corporation's
care about

274
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:22,249
have specific legal protections this is
why we have trade secret laws

275
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:27,100
this is why we have copyright laws this
is why we have patent and trademark laws

276
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,379
these are all weapons that they can use
to stop information from going public

277
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:37,980
or you know modulate how disclosure
happens and how information is used

278
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,429
that same lobby you know they they spend
a lot of money

279
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:45,350
trying to make sure that those laws are
protected personal privacy doesn't have

280
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,290
that lobby doesn't have that money
getting spend for it

281
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,488
so now that we have a better handle on
some other things that make surveillance

282
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:55,749
complicated

283
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,279
let's look at some more specific
examples have how surveillance can

284
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,089
affect people

285
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,779
most people tend to think up
surveillance is a bad thing and that's

286
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,369
how we mostly looked at it

287
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:09,089
but their ways you can it can actually
be really good depending on who you are

288
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,329
and what your relation to the
surveillance system is

289
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,399
because the effective any individual
real-world system are so complex we can

290
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,239
look at specific facets

291
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:22,149
I have different systems some other
real-world implementations that these

292
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:22,989
systems

293
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:26,360
have different effects have secondary
effects that kind of thing but that's

294
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,670
not our focus right now that's something
we're gonna cover

295
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,470
there are a number of different kinds at
surveillance systems that purport to be

296
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,379
lifesavers one kind or another and many
him really actually are

297
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,249
an a great example of this is medical
monitoring systems

298
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:44,970
that a medical tech companies are
building in and

299
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,359
that are being implanted right now
especially things like pacemakers

300
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:52,269
just getting full tiny kg data even if
its batch

301
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,379
off-loaded can be really really useful

302
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:59,540
in treating medical conditions on the
other hand if you have

303
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,119
an implant which is monitoring what your
heart is doing in real time

304
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:09,079
and can alert doctors and paramedics as
soon as something starts going wrong

305
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,389
you have a huge huge advantage to
survival

306
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,610
arm another example on some lines our
fault detection systems that are used

307
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,140
4 L for elderly people or for solitary
industrial workers

308
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,120
if you're on the factory floor you're
working alone you're working swing shift

309
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,689
something like that

310
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,360
you fall into something nobody sees you
because the factories half-empty

311
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,820
you know the system tell someone who can
then come and make sure you're OK

312
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,820
on another example are

313
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,070
the remote diagnosis and reconfiguration
systems that happen

314
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,129
that are been put into luxury
automobiles if the car gets into an

315
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,040
accident love the times these systems
can call the police in call paramedics

316
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,320
even in the event that everyone in the
car is unconscious and like you know you

317
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,570
run into a tree on a

318
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,020
on a dark road at night and the police
show up anyway

319
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,730
so manufactures packaging these systems
into luxury automobiles their marketing

320
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,480
them to large enterprises

321
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,559
or they'll require very good insurance
for private medical care in countries

322
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,129
which have

323
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,269
public insurance to get them these are
luxuries surveillance

324
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:19,059
wanna largest categories modern
surveillance is surveillance the Sun for

325
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,840
marketing purposes

326
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,379
it's an interesting area is this good
for the person it's being marketed to

327
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,779
to some extent corporations do market
profile in so they can manipulate

328
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:32,080
subjects into spending money

329
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,480
on things that maybe they don't believe
want to spend money on your regardless

330
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,830
of what their private desires

331
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,059
repair desires are but there's also an
element

332
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:44,149
however showing the subject the things
that they're most likely to want

333
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:47,230
to some degree you can actually see this
is kind of a service

334
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,100
ensuring that people are for aware
things that meet their desires

335
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,059
because that advertising is also trying
to manipulate in create that desire this

336
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:56,399
is a much more

337
00:18:56,399 --> 00:19:00,980
kind of money category om the really
that communication is not a one-way

338
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,090
street

339
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,840
this becomes much more obvious when you
look at market profile name is done in

340
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,059
more and more high-end products

341
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,820
as you go further up the scaling
something like you know ridiculously

342
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,360
expensive cars or even more so

343
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,789
ridiculously expensive private airplanes
there's a very small pool of buyers for

344
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,269
these things

345
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,870
and love the time it becomes much more
of a conversation where a company like

346
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,909
boeing is saying resource us now even
more so

347
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:32,669
is saying to the people hate what do you
want in your next jet

348
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:36,429
you know I'm getting this kind of direct
feedback you know they're so this is

349
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:40,240
blurry area where surveillance becomes a
conversation

350
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,929
becomes a more of a two way street

351
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:48,710
even once data has been captured by
system it's not necessarily treated the

352
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,450
same for everyone

353
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,760
a lot a record systems literally have
features explicitly designed

354
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,510
to protect some people's privacy to a
greater degree than others

355
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,950
we know this among other reasons because
people are regularly fired for looking

356
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,799
at people's day to who they should be
looking at

357
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,029
arm you know they're looking at the
medical records or the tax returns or

358
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,620
sealed arrest records

359
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,750
%uh the rich and famous in the case of
private Moroccan

360
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,059
private organizations this isn't a big
deal or as big a deal

361
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,340
the rich are in a position to to simply
demand this kind of treatment

362
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,678
and get by it you know and and for a lot
of them

363
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,730
if they have somebody on staff who just
goes around and hunt down information

364
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,789
about and they don't want republican has
have it sealed

365
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:38,240
that may be a perfectly reasonable
investment for them on the other hand

366
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,519
for state records that so much more
problematic issue the state should be

367
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,389
blind to these kind of things

368
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,159
that's not an acceptable position for
state that takes a fundamental position

369
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,480
of citizen equality

370
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,269
one other more common forms %uh
non-marking economic surveillance

371
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:00,460
is fraud detection for credit and debit
cards and checks and balance transfers

372
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,480
this is another form surveillance that
explicitly working in favor the user

373
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,880
because the user's interests are mostly
aligned in this case

374
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,630
with those at the bank of course to be
eligible for this kind of surveillance

375
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,840
you have to have a credit card and music

376
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,269
you have to write checks you have to
spend money in ways that can be

377
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,549
monitored

378
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,320
which generally means you are moving
further up the economic scale

379
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,769
if you have the money you can even pay
'em extra money

380
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:31,549
to be more closely watched you know you
can have

381
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:36,129
0 lets you know get this extra fraud
alert for 50 bucks a year whatever it is

382
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,570
you're the identity theft protection
system

383
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,149
so there are few categories have
surveillance that seemed to help

384
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:44,690
everyone fairly equally

385
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,779
like environmental surveillance
especially stuff like air and water

386
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,610
quality monitoring

387
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,610
however even these kinds is com systems
aren't necessarily that

388
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,929
equally distributed om

389
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:01,710
comprehensive environmental quality
testing is really expensive

390
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,649
different cities can afford it at
different levels inside the city

391
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:08,880
different areas receive different
amounts of attention

392
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,730
some arm you know some areas well let's
see

393
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,169
you know we've got a whole bunch of
high-rises here yeah we can install one

394
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,159
you know one water call the monitoring
system and protect a whole bunch of

395
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,000
people

396
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,669
well let's look at Property values in
that area you know there may be a

397
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:26,259
correlation in some cases

398
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,490
and a lot of cases arm

399
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,909
this disparity gets even larger in cases
where

400
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:36,289
private citizens decide to supplement
the

401
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:41,730
public monitoring that happens arm home
lead asbestos testing radon testing that

402
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,630
kind of thing

403
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,570
this happens like regularly and even
stuff like water and

404
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,658
air quality happens occasionally

405
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,190
%uh the same logic applies to traffic
counting systems that are used to

406
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,139
measure road repair and determine what
needs funding

407
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:00,480
in theory the transit agency should
distribute the sensors fairly across an

408
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,330
entire transit district

409
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,210
but the system is subject to Social
pressured subject areas where

410
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,049
0 this area people have time to file a
whole bunch of complaints when the new

411
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:11,629
pothole shows up

412
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,940
and you know so the traffic monitors go
out better

413
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,259
your you know go out more frequently
they have a better picture the traffic

414
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:22,029
because there's more data there's more
funding

415
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:25,230
it's not always the case that

416
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,059
this kind of stuff is even implicitly
aligned with

417
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,080
a population interest though there's a
really interesting case

418
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,580
I in 2001 with the stated or the City of
New York

419
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,908
actually band private air quality
testing

420
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:44,269
this was the aftermath the 9/11 and sent

421
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:47,600
and the debate was still raging over
what the long-term

422
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,830
problems were going to be exposure to
the dust from collapsed buildings

423
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,330
to the band air quality testing for a
while arm

424
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,370
because the liability cases were still
out

425
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,649
another category as and that its
surveillance is the alarm

426
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:07,259
or really the entire gamut of personal
protection systems

427
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,850
you can have your house and your car in
your laptop in your mobile phone and

428
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,240
your person all watched

429
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,759
Murphy how much good the services do you

430
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,009
varies among other things by how much
you want to spend you want to

431
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:22,990
pay for them you know you can get a
simple alarm system that will call the

432
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,230
police after your house has been broken
into a one price

433
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,460
you can get a silent alarm with cameras
and other price

434
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,860
you can get private armed response a
third price you can get

435
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,909
on-site armed guards at another price

436
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:40,389
surveillance most strongly benefits the
people who pay for it

437
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:44,750
in fact you often get kinda race the
bottom the one house on a block

438
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,500
that doesn't have private armed response
team gets rocked

439
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,919
everybody else lives in a paramilitary
camp if you go to LA

440
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,379
there are entire stretches in West
Hollywood on sunset boulevard along all

441
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:57,990
over

442
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,350
you know along some other some the very
rich neighborhoods where

443
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,070
every single house has a cement wall
which is topped with broken glass

444
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,379
and has a sign at the bottom the
driveway that private games with guns

445
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:13,159
will show up if you break in

446
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,340
it's only a fairly small fraction at the
surveillance and use

447
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,490
in a modern city but surveillance you
that used to stop crime is kind of what

448
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,700
we think about

449
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,139
when we think of surveillance you know
you have CCTV cameras on rooftops you're

450
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:27,789
overlooking back alleys

451
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:31,379
are places where people congregate
especially young people

452
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:34,759
you have the ring of steel it's being
built around the city London

453
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,549
com the same thing that's being that was
built and is now being rebuilt

454
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:43,080
around lower Manhattan you have airport
security scanners

455
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,090
so the efficacy of cameras especially
cameras that are monitor live

456
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,110
in actually stopping crime isn't severe
doubt

457
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,669
at best they're gonna bunches studies
especially an internal study by

458
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:58,950
the London police that was leaked that
have shown the cameras have a little

459
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,179
or frequently no effect whatsoever on
stopping crime

460
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,019
in fact the only crime that the City of
London study

461
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:10,870
showed the cameras actually prevented
was public urination

462
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,750
that's it that that actually had in fact
nothing else

463
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,259
I so police in municipalities are now
turning this argument around

464
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:22,330
and saying that all we need to install
smarter

465
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,379
better connected cameras that can be
monitored line is

466
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:28,940
on a form of so-called softer network
infrastructure

467
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,279
and that'll theoretically allow the
police to intervene in real time

468
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,379
of course this means hundreds and
hundreds and millions of dollars have

469
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:36,519
more expense

470
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,909
per installation I think the number for
lower Manhattan was $224 million dollars

471
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:46,000
assuming it comes in on time and on
budget it'll probably be three times

472
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,840
that

473
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,980
and there's no evidence that this will
be any more effective

474
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,500
then cameras that are recorded live
heard that aren't viewed live

475
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,690
are and especially not in comparison

476
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,309
to spending $750 million or whatever it
ends up being on

477
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:04,230
more police presence on the street where
they can actually do something actively

478
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,870
or all the traditional police techniques
that we know actually work in that have

479
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,309
a very long record

480
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:13,980
so regardless of their utility what's
interesting from our perspective is the

481
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,210
social division at the scammers create

482
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,250
or other the one that they reproduce
answer highlight

483
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,289
the camera creates 3 explicit social
roles and its interaction

484
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:27,450
the watcher to watch and the bystander
the distinction between the last two

485
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,500
categories is especially interesting

486
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,820
a camera installed for security is not
intended to catalog all actions in the

487
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,689
space

488
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,500
its only installed to it's only intended
to catalog the

489
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,990
said actions that the washer teams
interesting

490
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,950
cameras the Select out a subset of
actions and a subset the people that

491
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,539
pass through their frame

492
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,720
the actual or just the stereotypical
committers

493
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,840
those actions this is reflected in both

494
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,610
the attention that the watcher his to
the video and the positioning the camera

495
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,759
when cameras are intended to prevent
crimes against people

496
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,389
the bystanders the people who are in the
protect the armed

497
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:09,450
arm you know the class that aren't the

498
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,669
expected offenders become the protected
class

499
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:16,320
giving an even more stark opposition for
the watched

500
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,500
the cameras represent hostility they
represent suspicion

501
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,419
for the bystanders they represent
security and freedom from trouble

502
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:27,789
for the watcher they represent the
ability to choose whose in what class

503
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:33,399
which actions get responded to in which
actions get ignored

504
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:36,690
this is especially com relevant

505
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,409
in the case where you have police run
cameras observing police actions

506
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:45,009
the police in the frame should belong to
the protected class

507
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:48,480
you know they are one at the set of
people who the cameras should be

508
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,730
protecting

509
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,980
but by fraternity with her fella police
if nothing else

510
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,090
sometimes even by policy there in the
watching classic

511
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,350
there in the class they get it partially
decide

512
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,809
what actions are responded to this is
demonstrated nowhere better

513
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,049
that on occasions when the police are
when police brutality

514
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:12,059
shoulda been captured by police cameras
but when there's a trial

515
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,769
home we don't know what happened that
footage sorry

516
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:19,350
so another interesting thing we should
note

517
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,200
com without exception the protected are

518
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,899
mmm likely to belong to a higher
socioeconomic stratum

519
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:31,230
not only will the well-off be almost
always perceived

520
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,539
as less likely to be the offenders in
any given situation

521
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,940
they will also spend more time in
watched areas

522
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,450
it is no accident that the most heavily
watched areas in the world

523
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,070
are home to the global financial markets
you know

524
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,470
there even cases arm where their setups

525
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,409
that allowed the privilege to avoid the
scrutiny entirely for themselves

526
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,610
but still benefit from it com there's

527
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,480
i mean the the the classic classic
examples diplomatic privilege

528
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,960
you know this is the ultimate form of
bypassing surveillance of course you

529
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,600
cannot search my possession

530
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,820
I am a diplomat arm there's the clear
system which is now defunct in may be

531
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,668
coming back again at some point

532
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:16,110
which if you bought into it blodgett
bypass certain parts if

533
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,999
airport security or you can just get
driven into your office building

534
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,960
in a private limo driven by an off-duty
cop with dark tinted windows

535
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,830
you know and Pitt have played chains
every now and then

536
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,100
om another interesting note in this
category is

537
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,850
the collusion surveillance technology in
restricting speech

538
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,320
in public private areas like malls so

539
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,590
in those cases the division isn't simply
between

540
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,850
the social categories us you know who
the likely offenders are

541
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,049
but between those who are willing to
remain silent or

542
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,740
who agree with management and those who

543
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,889
com

544
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:02,110
you know those who actually want to
speak up and say something

545
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,499
so we've seen kinda consistent pattern
here an effective surveillance

546
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:09,820
om in a surveillance can be good and bad

547
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,749
but its an activity which directly
embodies the power structures

548
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:19,029
other societies that perform it the
technologies that

549
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:22,470
on implement surveillance render the
social structures

550
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,480
very literally in steel and glass and
silicon

551
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,749
an embedded into the fabric of the city
in it you know in a very literal sense

552
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:31,179
you know these things are being built

553
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:35,309
into buildings into subways into streets

554
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:38,668
oMG in more and more ubiquitous ways

555
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:43,309
so we have a consistent pattern where
people with money or power or social

556
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,320
status

557
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,570
can either act less to be watched in bad
ways and more in good ways

558
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,259
or simply enjoy greater protection as a
secondary effect if their social

559
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,129
standing

560
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:56,399
its to serve another reflection of the
ubiquitous privilege that they move

561
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,320
through

562
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,029
om often completely unaware

563
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:05,919
that everyone doesn't experience the
same kind of surveillance profile

564
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,440
the shows no signs of stopping om on the
country there sa whole class initiatives

565
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,399
called Smart City initiatives

566
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:16,740
which among other things are looking at
pushing

567
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,450
things like environmental monitoring a
lot of the kinds have good surveillance

568
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,450
out to portable devices you have like oh
your smartphone can be an air quality

569
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,669
monitor that kind of thing

570
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:30,730
you know this may be good in the end but
in the meantime

571
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,320
the gadgets that are enabling this kind
of thing our luxury devices

572
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,918
I mean I'm sure a lot of people in the
room have them but they're not free

573
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,490
they're not even necessarily cheap

574
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,259
and this is reproducing the same kind of
cultural divide

575
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:47,970
you know it may propagate down in the
end but it's not going to happen

576
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,480
immediately

577
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,850
so can we do about all this com both the
growing surveillance state

578
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,950
and the inequality in surveillance need
to be addressed

579
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,850
kind in equal measure Packers & makers
are really interesting and unique place

580
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,590
here

581
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,210
we have both the technical background in
the system's

582
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,679
and often the socio-political
understanding to see the full breadth to

583
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,850
the problem

584
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,059
we also have at least a somewhat
organized community

585
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,210
that can work together albeit in a very
sort of

586
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,820
distributed way arm we're in some ways a
very privileged group

587
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,779
but in other ways were frequently fairly
marginalized group

588
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,950
this puts us in a position as if we try

589
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,360
being able to reach out kinda in both
directions

590
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,509
so therefore things we can do roughly
speaking we can document the problem

591
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:42,809
we can raise awareness so that we can
work to change existing projects are

592
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:44,309
being implemented directly

593
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:48,049
and we can subvert these systems in a
lot of ways this is the same catalog

594
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:51,830
tactics that's true for any kind of
social change any kind of social

595
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,309
movement

596
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:57,559
arm and like any other social change
movement

597
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,970
their existing groups working a lot of
these areas if you work with these

598
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,220
groups you can have more fun fact:

599
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,340
so the details up the ways the different
groups watch s

600
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,450
and what happens that data are not often
public and they're certainly not

601
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:18,839
aggregated inactivity publicized helping
to find and collate this kind of

602
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,879
information

603
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,659
is a basic first step for any kind about
the work you can't

604
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,649
on you know trying to talk to people
about this before you understand

605
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,969
the scope of the problem and how the
system is working

606
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:34,020
this can be as simple as doing things
like marking an updating maps

607
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,509
have where surveillance cameras are
neighborhoods on the other hand it could

608
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,659
be a lot more involved

609
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,919
arm it can mean doing background
research on the technical systems that

610
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:44,368
are used for surveillance

611
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,639
it can mean filing Freedom Information
Act spore

612
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,040
whatever the local inner comical what's
are in other countries

613
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,239
to find out what's going on with these
systems

614
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,890
it can mean reverse engineering you know
physical examples the surveillance

615
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,799
systems themselves and documenting them

616
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,010
there's interesting a case is this that
happened recently in Seattle

617
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,500
there was a wrongful arrest case
involving a hacker and the police

618
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,770
weren't forthcoming

619
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,110
video evidence that was relevant to the
case you know I'll

620
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,600
it got deleted so

621
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,180
the the gang question was unwilling
willing to take that answers so he

622
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,109
determined that the surveillance
management system that the police

623
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,400
reusing cap secure logs

624
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,630
anytime media was deleted and he had his
lawyers request the locks

625
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,840
you know clearly the police should be
able to back up their

626
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,920
their supposition that this data was
deleted with the locks

627
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,440
so he analyzed the log files figured out
how they market data and how they

628
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,600
tracked it

629
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,089
and prove that the video did still exist
it was

630
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,240
you know this video can be deleted after
90 days but it's kept on a

631
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,260
space-available basis

632
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,040
so then he went back to the police and
said well know this video still exists

633
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,140
here's the proof

634
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,750
turn over the video data they did so

635
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,440
now this means ominous the same you know

636
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,790
most surveillance video management
systems used by the police do the same

637
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,890
thing

638
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,450
now lawyers who are in the same position
with their clients

639
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,620
can take the same action they can
request the logs

640
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,040
have somebody analyze those logs and see
if the videos

641
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,060
actually gone and also because the
surveillance systems are actually

642
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,570
somewhat decently designed

643
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:29,170
there it shows the difference if data is
ever manually deleted

644
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:33,860
so if the police want to go and say oh
well that it was deleted

645
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,340
what we know that it was deleted by this
user intentionally

646
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,970
you know that's a very different
position in court and a judge can take

647
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,200
that into account

648
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,200
even if they can't find out why they did
it was deleted or get it back

649
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,620
so it's not just enough for us to
understand these issues

650
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,170
any more than it is for the knowledge
these issues to be fragmented not really

651
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,910
essentially

652
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,859
centrally brought together as a cohesive
image the rest the world needs to

653
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,310
understand this too

654
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,180
we've been telling people about com
obviously computer security and also

655
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,589
online privacy for a really long time

656
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,940
but we need to start telling up to
insert speaking up more

657
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,300
and talking to the larger community in
saying hey

658
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,090
all these issues that we've been talking
about in terms of online security

659
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,890
yet this happen at your grocery store
now too you need to deal with and there

660
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,799
as well

661
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,980
you need to deal with the you need to
start thinking about the same kinds of

662
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,820
actions

663
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,170
arm you know in and

664
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,220
it's important to get through the
messages well that this kind of

665
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,000
surveillance

666
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,450
doesn't necessarily help you just
because you're on video

667
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,600
doesn't make you safer

668
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,920
most new surveillance projects and the
legal structures that you serve a large

669
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,270
projects are built on

670
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,410
are created in a total vacuum which
gives us a place to act

671
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,560
arm this is the kind of the usual stuff
a civic activism

672
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,330
on whether that means protest or contact
lawmakers

673
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,069
or raising issues surveillance planning
meetings getting into all the annoying

674
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,930
technical stuff

675
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,440
whatever com want a really interesting
issues here

676
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,230
is the modern surveillance exists Canada
Cup love levels

677
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,000
it can exist like the national law level
answer the internet level

678
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,150
but it also is very specifically
geographically sir are located

679
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,000
you know surveillance cameras may be
plugged into the cloud but they

680
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,410
exist in one specific physical location
and you have to act on both sides

681
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,240
you know there's both the well what if
the US had national privacy protection

682
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,050
laws like Europe does

683
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,720
and then there's the hey you know let's
go talk to the businesses that we

684
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,540
interact with

685
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,500
and say down to the guy at the bodega
hey you realized that

686
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,740
that camera isn't going to stop somebody
from robbing your store

687
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,160
but it does mean is that those video
records can be subpoenaed

688
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,810
if the police think you're dealing drugs
in one her ass you

689
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:01,990
om you know so you have to kind of work
does levels like that

690
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,790
subverting systems is something really
good at its kind of what we do

691
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,970
it can take a lot of different forms you
can have prankster just show how

692
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,840
ridiculous this whole surveillance
culture is

693
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,900
hombre can also be practical tools and
techniques

694
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,500
for either avoiding surveillance the
problem orders for countering the power

695
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,810
dynamic that it creates

696
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:24,600
arm you've got things like a the Tor
project the check was talking about the

697
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,509
other round

698
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,180
for pricing content fighting traffic
analysis and you've got thirty are for

699
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,870
secure messaging that both exist for

700
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,960
getting around the first problem have
dealing with

701
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,980
com avoiding surveillance

702
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,020
but to blast furnace talking the talk
about

703
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,370
a new competition for projects in the
second category to help

704
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,310
equalize the power balance in terms of
surveillance

705
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,340
so the greatest power imbalance NIS fear
surveillance exists between the private

706
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,110
citizen and the state

707
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,330
and this is most exacerbated when a
citizen is trying to take action against

708
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,790
a violence

709
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,160
police in military brutality Israel
happens all the time

710
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,839
and I haven't all over the world in
every country

711
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,920
the worst excesses happen when no one is
watching

712
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,280
even a surveillance tools are widely
deployed throughout the world

713
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,080
there are many countries were
surveillance is only ever going to be a

714
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,700
tool of oppression where it's never
going to work for you

715
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,730
a lot of situations there's no question
whether or not you're going to show up

716
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,780
on video

717
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,380
and that if that video can be used to
incriminate you it will be

718
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,190
this is especially true for large
political demonstrations

719
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,230
however if the state decides to suppress
a demonstration

720
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,120
especially if they're if they do decide
that yeah we're just gonna send in the

721
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,020
tanks

722
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,990
and you know should everything that
moves or you know whatever special in a

723
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,160
more brutal suppression ce

724
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,520
they often suppressed the video they
don't want anybody seeing them doing

725
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,370
this

726
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:56,299
om it's questionable at best if getting
very are from places like burner on

727
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,930
can actually material with materially
affect the situation on the ground

728
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,180
in an immediate sense but on the other
hand it does affect public opinion in

729
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,399
the long term

730
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,800
you know if you look at the than in a
case in Iran there was a huge huge

731
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,480
organizing point that really prolonged
there's protest and really

732
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,810
prolonged public support because that
video got out

733
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,100
arm even more interesting to us our
cases

734
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,460
where there is reports to the rule of
law you know that you can actually

735
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,210
take action after the fact but they're
still significant corruption

736
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,220
you know the police are still going in
there beating people up

737
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,480
this is a really big for the world but
the developing world and the developed

738
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
world

739
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,530
so the obvious way to fix this is to
shoot your own video

740
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,810
you can't install a citywide camera
network it's too expensive it's not a

741
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,080
reasonable thing to do but you don't
have to

742
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,150
all you need is a few cameras that are
in the right place at the right time

743
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,460
you can use the phone that shoots video
or a cheap

744
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,050
you know hand-held camera but there for
problems with them

745
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,960
first do you really want to be the guy
standing in front the group Rakoff's

746
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,780
holding up the video camera

747
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,720
watching them beat the crap out of some
guy wonders 201 a few

748
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,550
no you don't om second

749
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,080
if you can't get their badge numbers
down it's a lot harder to take action

750
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,930
afterwards

751
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,160
when you're like waving your camera
running away from those two hundred riot

752
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,799
cops are not recording anything useful

753
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,150
I mean it might be useful for PR but
it's not useful in court

754
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,860
arm the video is stuck on your camera
until it gets uploaded

755
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,000
when the rare cops catch up to you and
take UN

756
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,100
even if they didn't see you holding up
the camera they're still gonna beat the

757
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,520
crap out of you when they look on your
phone

758
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,009
and if you don't let them see your phone
I'll just beat the crap out of you until

759
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,650
you do

760
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:50,450
arm fourth there's no way to Cali this
video or manage it online

761
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,400
you can put those videos on YouTube but
what if you happen to be in an area

762
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,490
where

763
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,570
the cameras didn't get a good look at
everybody's face

764
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:02,110
do you really want to you know or you
got a much better

765
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:06,050
or you recorded deceptive conversation
about something identify something

766
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,440
you don't necessarily want that for you
going out public right away

767
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,760
because I can get people killed arm

768
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,430
every jurisdiction also has different
rules around what you can record what

769
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,859
you can't record

770
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,630
if you have a system that's capable or
recording audio use it to record stuff

771
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,110
on the street

772
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,650
even if you're not recording audio you
can still sometimes get arrested for

773
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,020
wiretap

774
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,650
on so if you're building system for the
US you really like it to not be able to

775
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,940
record audio

776
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,290
because then you can just tell the cops
know no microphone

777
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,800
you know they may arrest you anyway but
it's a lot harder and it's been much

778
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,200
much harder to prove that wrongful
arrest after the fact

779
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,050
on the other hand you know 50 percent
the world has a cell phone

780
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:53,340
and a lot of those funds in the
recording video in a few years

781
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,440
solutions to the love to have leveling
the playing field a bit

782
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,960
I want to announce a competition com to
build

783
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,240
deployable video cameras a combination
have

784
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,680
off-the-shelf components open hardware
and free software that can be deployed

785
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,810
in an urban environment

786
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:12,970
arm there's three categories aerial
cameras

787
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,230
static cameras and saw from the
solutions to run on existing no biles

788
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,160
that provide discrete live uploading an
appropriate media management

789
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,160
sell for UAV I mean maybe somebody'll
build a

790
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,560
a fixed-wing you know actually flying
option

791
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,759
but much more likely it's gonna be like
the quadcopter that perches on the Roof

792
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,340
Inn can sit and stare

793
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,560
you know and you can get up there is
still a fairly cheap platform but it can

794
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,640
go places nothing else can

795
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,290
or it's the camera that you know you
throw over phone lines like a pair of

796
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,170
shoes that hangs out up there

797
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,240
and so you tell it it just drop and pick
it up later

798
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,200
the goal the competition is to spur work
on these kinda devices and similar ones

799
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,900
on as much it is as it is to develop
immediately feel double solutions

800
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,640
on it's probably gonna take a few
iterations to get to something which is

801
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,180
really gonna be actively useful in the
field and is going to be cheap enough

802
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,140
but on the other hand if you don't start
you'll never get there

803
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,359
om the competition is open to everyone
hacker spaces and maker spaces or

804
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,300
special encouraged to enter

805
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,000
this is a relatively big problem coming
up with a good solution is going to

806
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,700
require teamwork

807
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,410
arm the only from requirements are that
everything that's developed for the

808
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,500
competition

809
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,190
has to be released under open source
software and open hardware and open

810
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,020
documentation licenses

811
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,970
so that it can be actually reproduced by
the group in question without needing

812
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,930
some kind of centralized supply chain
and that the system needs to be legal in

813
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,210
some kinda challengers texan

814
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,250
arm if you're in the US there's no point
in submitting

815
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,580
a system that uses three getting hurt
radios because that's just gonna get

816
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,770
somebody arrested a much faster

817
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,460
so a this is the senate judging criteria

818
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,220
I'm not gonna go through all of these om
I'm not gonna go into details in scoring

819
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,760
and i cant thing right now

820
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,520
there's a competition website that has
all this information available on it

821
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,920
com to know towns give the you're all
right now sits in time

822
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,300
arm the cost is definitely a criteria
for this competition

823
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,250
but it's expected first generation
devices are probably going to be

824
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,410
too expensive by you know at least an
order of magnitude

825
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:26,470
for what would really like to see for
the field but

826
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:30,250
you know that happens the prices will
come down

827
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,610
om second teams are really strongly
encouraged to get together with groups

828
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,040
that might actually feel these things

829
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,800
in the real world talk to these people
work with them

830
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,730
you know do use case studies find out
what they think would be useful

831
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:50,010
I if you work with a group both working
with the group will be taken into

832
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,370
account and also

833
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:55,950
if you get a group that says pay you
know we organize protests all the time

834
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,580
like cop watch in Berkeley it has a
bunch of other branches

835
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,210
you know and this would be exactly the
camera that we need

836
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:07,180
great you know that that also get taken
into account for the judging

837
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,089
there's gonna be a preliminary
evaluation of progress for all the teams

838
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,560
that are registered in about six months

839
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,200
I'm hoping to maybe talk about this at
the CCC Congress in December

840
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,400
if we have some results then om
basically if we have about

841
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,020
you know 75 percent or so the teams are
registries got some real feel little

842
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,040
systems and

843
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,680
with it it will be the judge in round
then if the development cycle ends up

844
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,720
taking longer

845
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,370
you know we'll we'll talk to the teams
and see with the deadline sound like

846
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,259
they should be

847
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:43,260
so there's the URL a salir C dot com
slash projects slash deployable

848
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,460
so any questions

849
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,340
and out the slider that other URL
staunchly that there for a minute

850
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:57,340
people right now

851
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,760
is there a mic for questions

852
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,760
okay

853
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,890
so I actually haven't got the the
question was about the

854
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:30,299
the New York City air quality testing
issue I haven't done

855
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,360
arm as much research on that one as I
should have arm there was a

856
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,250
professor at Columbia who does
environmental systems work in the

857
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,370
Architecture Department

858
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,920
who pass that on to me I think it was a
short term thing

859
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,440
I'm certainly because their position on
the health risks there changes pretty

860
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,200
rapidly

861
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,330
after it was shown that yeah this was
saddam you know obviously had real

862
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,299
health effects

863
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,410
I'm so I think it was at best a short
term thing

864
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,870
and again I'm not sure if they ever
managed to successfully enforce it or

865
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,380
not

866
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:07,380
on but they did actually get to the
point of trying to prevent it legally

867
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:27,060
yeah

868
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,810
arm the question was about an outline is
like

869
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,110
questions I'm assuming to talk to city
councils within that kind of thing

870
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:37,290
I haven't prepared anything like that
I'd be happy to work with someone to do

871
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:37,850
that

872
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:42,259
arm the slide to the stock in the script
for the stalker available online

873
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,130
on as far as if you wanna get com more
information about some other stuff I've

874
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:46,790
referenced

875
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:50,950
and then yet get in touch with me on I
definitely be interested in working with

876
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:57,950
people to put that kind of document
together

877
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,600
now I'm I'm probably gonna put up im
some what some point

878
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:08,600
to

879
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,010
so the question is about com who else
might end up

880
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,900
using the the results of this
competition other than the people who

881
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,700
would like to

882
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:15,160
I guess here's the thing arm police
agencies don't have to go to open harbor

883
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,290
for their surveillance need

884
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,590
they just bolt up cameras and they can
afford to put cameras everywhere

885
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,190
and arm the military and intelligence
agencies

886
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,730
are already building I mean they already
have Predator drones they don't need to

887
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,430
build opens first Predator drones

888
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:34,170
on basically this is about technology

889
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,250
equalization and getting the technology
out have just the hands

890
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:43,060
I love government agencies and larger
corporations they can for the existing

891
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,810
I'm military-industrial versions and
saying okay we'll

892
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:53,810
we get to have those toys to play too

893
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,350
the the question was about why make it
fit in a legal

894
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,880
legal into a jurisdiction so basically
the idea is that

895
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,290
okay so the only law that you're
violating france is a couple states have

896
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,000
recently

897
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,160
arm pastor trying to pass laws banning

898
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,540
you know taking pictures with police if
you break a law

899
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,300
that bans pic taking pictures the police
that's fine but

900
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,820
if you ban a law that says you if you're
if you're like breaking frequency

901
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,780
allocation stuff that kind of thing

902
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,380
that gives them another lever to use to
ban these systems with and and then they

903
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,820
can say oh this is a public safety issue
these

904
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,670
you know these these crazy people are
building these systems that don't

905
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,330
respect

906
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:44,170
radiology Asians or whatever and that
kinda thing and it makes it much much

907
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,290
harder for

908
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,230
a legitimate group to actually feel the
system like this om

909
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,900
you know it's almost certain that if we
get these systems being actively use on

910
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,780
a regular basis

911
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,190
yeah of course are gonna get bad but
that's a different categories law

912
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,440
verses something around om yessir

913
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,510
yeah I'd existing at Public Safety
existing spectrum laws exist near that

914
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,200
kind of thing

915
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,990
are now is basically saying you know can
assist can a a

916
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:14,020
Canada field something like this and not
get arrested

917
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:21,020
on completely unrelated charges yes

918
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:46,850
so

919
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:51,100
om the the question is about who I see
taking

920
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:55,210
you know taking the initiative to use
these kinds of tools it's already

921
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:56,570
becoming

922
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:00,120
moreover done thing for you know okay

923
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:05,880
so here's an example om a number of
years ago a friend of mine that was

924
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,370
involved in some student organization
organizing work in the UK

925
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:13,299
are mad Brighton University when the
students were doing a bunch of takeovers

926
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,030
have and administration buildings as
part of a student general strikes

927
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,740
and his job was to stand in frame and be
completely innocuous and do absolutely

928
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,610
nothing

929
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,820
that could possibly get himself arrested
because

930
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:31,130
then she could go arm subpoena for those
videos he could go file field

931
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,050
Information Act request for those videos

932
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:36,340
without there being any risk at him
incriminated himself in the process of

933
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,140
doing so

934
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,420
and make sure that the videos were
released so

935
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,580
in some kinda very grassroots ways
people are already taking action

936
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:49,490
to equalize the effective surveillance
on and you're getting similar things

937
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,180
where

938
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,430
I mean like okay look at how the com

939
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,330
look at how g21 Toronto the

940
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:02,279
media picture for surveillance you know
by the organized news networks was a

941
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,860
tiny percentage to the video that came
outta there

942
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,370
you had 15,000 minutes a video for ever

943
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,410
others you know citizen video for every
minute network video they got shot

944
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,140
on the got uploaded to YouTube or
whatever and you know i mean

945
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,799
round numbers but om this kind of thing
is already happening

946
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,660
people are just using tools that really
suck so let's give them tools that don't

947
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,890
suck quite as much

948
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:32,890
anyone else

949
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:51,369
om feel free to send stuff to me and her
you know and we can we can talk of one

950
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:03,540
no I'm not okay

951
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,470
dasher there is one more

952
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:14,470
question

953
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:26,710
yes

954
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,830
the question was arm

955
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:58,900
why worry about I since becoming legal
on technicalities when that happens

956
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,950
before the you know

957
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,660
before they've actually that's actually
been a problem basically because

958
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,580
if the system's get fielded for real and
reorganizations are using this

959
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,240
arm you don't want to get someone in any
more trouble

960
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:18,080
then they may get into any way and if
that means that in addition it too

961
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,370
you know whatever charges somebody gets
laid in

962
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,520
they get arm also charged with

963
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,160
a you know if I let you know that SEC
charges or whatever and some additional

964
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:28,770
fine

965
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:32,960
that some real organization has to pay
that fine when we find out that you have

966
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,010
somebody screwed up

967
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:37,170
I'm so it seems like it's kind of an
aspect of due diligence

968
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,780
you know it's for the same reason is
that okay if you're going to make an

969
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,300
actual Etana miss you AV version of this
thing

970
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,760
you need to be very careful that it's
not going to crash into something kill

971
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,110
them

972
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,310
because then whoever's fielding a gets
charged with like obstruction of justice

973
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:56,160
and manslaughter and you really like 10
not give somebody in the field that

974
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:56,990
additional water

975
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:01,830
I think we're pretty much a time

976
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,370
on if anyone else has crossed
