1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,240
it this this talk is basically for you
guys because what we do as IT

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,520
professionals is we're really good at
the tax stuff

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,510
and we can understand what's going on
with our network but really sucky at

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,920
explaining that to managers and other
people

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,529
and explain that in a way that is
defensible so

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,100
while we can say that yeah arm you
should probably update your SSL certs

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,570
and you should probably like these
badges: we can't really

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,580
say that in a way that makes them
understand it to the dollar line

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,250
so hopefully with this presentation will
give you guys a framework

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,520
to to you explained that risks the

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,559
to managers and have them understand so
just a quick warning

12
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,410
arm a risk analysis is intellectual

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,579
process and if you're not intellectually
rigorous

14
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,449
that process the product you make his
pal crap and

15
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:55,610
I've seen a lot really bad right now
since risk analyses

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,090
cell just be careful when you're doing
this that you need to make sure that you

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,910
are pigeonhole yourself to one specific
threat work

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,490
just focusing on one set of ideas but
your

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,289
your including all them all the ideas
that you will get it

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,560
than a minute the other notice I work
for confidential stuff sack but the same

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,210
here so the FBI doesn't impress me

22
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,869
now this is classified circle so

23
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:27,130
what's terrible story a friend named
Nate networks for an IT company

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,420
Nate was recently visit by his boss who
if you

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,790
with if you've ever read the bastard
operator from hell that his boss

26
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,400
so he trembles and and ask Sam so I read
this thing last night but hackers are

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,990
attacking our network I want to know
what the risk is

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,450
post-war network by hackers and the
walks out so they said their

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,670
is like while so

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,700
I'll so use that service the framework
for talking about

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,409
how we look at risk in the situation
because we all in 20

32
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,469
in intrinsically apparently no what's
risky

33
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,969
and what the risks are but we're not
really explain it like that sup

34
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,099
what is risk

35
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,589
can anyone hear shouted out please
explain to me what risk is what do you

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,569
think risk it

37
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,879
sorry that's actually forget

38
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,500
probably even adverse event

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,830
end-users Rs brilliant

40
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,480
breaking up is a risk so

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,780
things that need to be matched alright

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,760
so a risk as as works when you're here

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,049
seems to be things that might be adverse
in the future

44
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,470
but the definition rest that's used by
at least Italian zucchini and used by

45
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,810
the academic really is that risk
involves

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,340
only in certain to get the future so it
doesn't waited

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,090
batter good good things could happen in
the future too and that's a risk that we

48
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,500
take

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,769
right so the return I love

50
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,030
and investment could be less than we
want but it still

51
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,840
a positive investment so there's a rest
that you that it will come back to us

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,489
so if we like the standard distribution
curve which is over here

53
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,519
um the green is good stuff and the red
is that stuff

54
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,480
so in security we generally I like about
stuff

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,360
so we accept that %uh the definition
address that we've given we're only

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,459
looking at the bad stuff

57
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,340
now when your managers asking you

58
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,159
something about risk it's generally
wannabes six questions

59
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,920
what can happen how likely is it
happened what are the consequences

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,870
what can be done for the benefits and
possibly jobs in and what he in tax

61
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,459
so everything that ever question about a
risk a possible your future

62
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,519
boils down 26 question so if you prepare
to the six questions you'll be fine

63
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,810
and today we're going to talk about
these three are here

64
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,819
that the risk assessment we so

65
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,760
sup don't know

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,450
I see it in your eyes are glazing over
you think this is actual map iraq this

67
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,620
is not mad this is a sentence explain in
fancy terms

68
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,110
so how do we explain

69
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,340
the three things that the three a

70
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,570
same as we just said that risk
assessment it in

71
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,130
that Sol go through it slowly resque

72
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,280
which is they are is the combination of
which is the segment

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,960
the probable even affect so it's
initiate and so

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,900
new goes up in Times Square so that's
the missing about

75
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,190
probably even outcome given that event
new cause oftentimes work casualties

76
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,199
the valuation of that outcome a that a

77
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,210
event now compare become a

78
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,150
cell given their new plan of and their
casualties how many casualties are

79
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,310
for every event now come this is
generally where we get tripped up a

80
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,680
little bit because

81
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,160
knows where it says every that includes
like zombies in this space aliens and

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,740
zombie george bush so

83
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,180
so you know it gets kinda big the the
set

84
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,570
%uh sliding be online later so you can
get everything you want I'll have a big

85
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,990
slide with the website

86
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,870
arm so how do you skill that down

87
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,830
and that gets to be one of the biggest
sticking point is how do you make that

88
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,949
gigantic

89
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,960
list of things that could possibly
happen into something it's manageable

90
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,698
they can actually look at

91
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,750
Scandic sorry scott and it's not

92
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,639
a group for Asian don't do that so still

93
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,970
the the scenario that were looking for
the scope

94
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,350
is the Sat Nav the brackets are set a
protector

95
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,900
a threat an asset so let's look at it
from the backwards here

96
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,139
an asset an asset is something that
either you drive profit from

97
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,490
as person or company or an entity or you
are

98
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,139
in charge of safety this could be a
database

99
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,169
if you're accompanies could be people if
you the police department this could be

100
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,758
your hose if your camp this could be
anything

101
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,120
literally anything that you drive profit
from or you're in charge in safekeeping

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
for

103
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,310
so you would be the protector

104
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,830
the key so you can even skill that down
inside company to

105
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,639
okay this might be the network
operations center this could be the IT

106
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,100
staff this could be the managers this
could be

107
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,039
the finance department that we're
looking at specific terms with and the

108
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,389
company or the company as a whole

109
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,370
or the United States so if the threat is
to the secure the nation

110
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,280
United States is the protector not just
specific people

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,720
and the threat is anything that's trying
to

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,190
lessen the amount of profit you get from
the asset to

113
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,240
tarnish the asset somehow or destroy the
ass

114
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,630
so this is basically what to say

115
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,250
yep sell for neck left

116
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,280
if we go back the the boss asks

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,990
what our risk was from hackers so we are
the protector

118
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,460
natan the NOC because we're the only
people that can stop it so

119
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,250
the finance department isn't gonna step
in and start running

120
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,139
and map scans on the network and setup
cigar box

121
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,720
it's not so they're the ones that are
ultimately protecting that work

122
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,160
the threat is from hackers

123
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,099
not you guys that happens arm in the
asset

124
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,330
according to the boss is the company
information so

125
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,859
at the end a day he doesn't really care
about the network secure about the

126
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,560
information that's where he gets his
dollars from

127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,069
right so that equation

128
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:41,810
imagine probability what has probability
so

129
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,030
however will probably is best described
as all the things that can happen how

130
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,860
likely is

131
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,090
each one so thinking more abstractly

132
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,550
think the universe as a big box big
two-dimensional blue box

133
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,860
such as the one up here so let's say
were wanting to flip the point

134
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,780
alright and if point let before picking
you become a hazard

135
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,050
come up tables right so there's only to
solutions

136
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,759
there's only two things that happen so
our universe

137
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,830
if we flip that coin gets divided into
it right

138
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,770
so there comes up Hazare comes up tales
so given that comes up heads

139
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,509
what's probably it comes up as again you
buy that and

140
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,900
into another half so if you want to
think about this visual concept

141
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,379
if you're thinking this is a dartboard
it's a lot easier just to get details

142
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,160
and hit the heads and hands

143
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,130
or hasn't s right so and that the size
of each box represents

144
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,029
its relative probability

145
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,439
watch them and you always want strive
for me see

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,010
me see it means mutually exclusive and
collectively exhaustive

147
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,980
so no events overlap so there's no

148
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,790
for in this example arm you can't have a
point B Simon test simultaneously on

149
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,490
heads and tails

150
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,680
technically up and also you have to
account for other things I have like the

151
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,899
coin rolling away

152
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,570
so you're trying to make the box as
cucumbers is possibly one fill the

153
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,640
entire box you will make sure that your
universe is as complete as possible

154
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,269
given the scope

155
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,000
right this is a great quote from Isaac
Asimov

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,320
and his his second foundation book

157
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
you must not say never as an actual as a
lazy

158
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,040
slurring over the fact actually and is
word was there

159
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,430
cycle history but risk analysis which is
and the same thing if you think about it

160
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,360
predicts only probabilities a particular
event maybe even a test with probable so

161
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,940
massively on probable but the probably
is always greater than 0

162
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,430
the world could hang tomorrow that
should probably be in your universe if

163
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,240
you're thinking about

164
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,200
you know a large incomes at univers
zombie killer could come back tomorrow

165
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,470
not probable but parts

166
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,040
so when you calculate probability the
best thing to do is to get raw data

167
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,910
raw data is beautiful cell

168
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,610
generally it's number successful attacks
per period divided by

169
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,930
the number for taps purpurea which will
give you

170
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,149
in that period how often you have an
access a successful attack

171
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,370
I'm so if you have three successful
attacks have 30,000

172
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,350
camps in a month say then you have
probably have point

173
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,579
0001 that's a 100 per person

174
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,740
and that that's a lotta numbers are so
are

175
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,029
especially if you don't have raw data
like we don't really have good

176
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,100
data on terrorist attacks because there
aren't a lot of terrorist attacks the

177
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,050
United States so

178
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,700
and terrorist ok talk to us about how
they do their attacks in such

179
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,810
so we don't really know what's going on
with the terrorist attacks

180
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,920
so what we use mostly is week

181
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,599
Khan subject matter less stations so we
talk experts for experts

182
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,260
in terrorist attacks that tells the guy
the rest of this is

183
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,269
low medium high whenever right so

184
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,660
there they're putting their gut feeling
which is what we all feel about you know

185
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,189
networks is that

186
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,370
into one of these three best low medium
high

187
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,350
and while you can't do math necessarily
on low medium high bans it's really good

188
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,209
for

189
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,390
showing for showing managers

190
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,630
its when you don't have actual did

191
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,089
so remember that the probability for
this must be calculated for both

192
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,680
the event and the outcome given the
event because those were two separate

193
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,899
probably parts in our big question
that's not a question

194
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,079
so makes you calculate the

195
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,810
so what is valuation matter is that
little part the stack-on against the V

196
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,470
you can hope and the reason is

197
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,709
think about it a lot of people here

198
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,089
had to come from very long distances
would you rather have

199
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,089
driven are taking airplane a lot of
people will avoid taking airplanes and

200
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:52,529
taken said trains are cars or buses or
whatever

201
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,420
because they fear die in a car at their
dying in a plane crash

202
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,860
so much the value their death in a plane
crash

203
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,300
higher than their death in a car
accident so we're talking about people's

204
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
response

205
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,440
and you use it as a valuation valuation
metric

206
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,529
the way to go is is to you to understand
that the valuation matters

207
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,550
so the risk might be higher in death in
a car accident

208
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,019
but the valuations lower so the overall
risk that people perceive

209
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:24,040
is lower so the questioners will there's
another site layout

210
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,240
disputes while more but a the valuation
can be

211
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,389
based on money so I'd attack

212
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,120
a happens how much my dealers I can be
best on

213
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,370
time how much time you lose goodwill if
your iPhone is a crappy product how many

214
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,769
people will be pissed off at you

215
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:46,810
whatever is a must concern where you
start getting her problems where you get

216
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,589
to the sort of statistical value of life
stuff

217
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,260
where you start assigning numbers to
people's lives like your was 6.4 million

218
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,459
dollars where

219
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,459
yeah there's a moral dilemma with that
because then you're

220
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,430
you're signing onto your values to
people's lives and people don't like

221
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,279
that

222
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,540
so I try to avoid that but some people
like Anna

223
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,389
so here's the process in general now
this is a very basic process

224
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,750
and you can do this pretty quickly it it
might take a couple weeks to get the

225
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,250
data and then use live together in Sun

226
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,810
so along the top your best to make the
chart and

227
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,540
along the top you're gonna put

228
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,550
things like you know tack and successful
attack

229
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,610
so this leave a comment came up with
three categories

230
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,260
no tak unsuccessful attack successful
attack his foot last car category into

231
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,630
internal external

232
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,750
because he could and you want to look at
it

233
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,889
and on the other side your input the
outcomes concerns %uh the

234
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:44,550
initiating events from top they were
talking and the outcomes concern

235
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,760
are long left so he was looking at data
loss

236
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,850
data exfiltration which is someone came
and grabbed a database

237
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,480
now has all your customer data or data
corruption which is someone when an

238
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,680
an altered the last number America
credit card to the plus-one

239
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,639
or something so if we look at it

240
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,769
and we think about it the probably that
no attack is it wouldn't happen is very

241
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,170
very low

242
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,190
we're all being attacked all the time so
you're never gonna have a day

243
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,209
were no attack happened so the
probability that happen is low

244
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:19,070
given that you have no attack happened
was probably in half day loss resulting

245
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,010
from that no attack

246
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,550
unless you're an idiot you start
deleting all your tail yourself it's

247
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,070
probably not gonna happen

248
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,800
so that probably is very low how much we
care about that work reuse that the

249
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,579
valuation have how much do we care

250
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,380
for this a particular example so how
much do we care

251
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,189
that you know because I've user error

252
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,269
there was dale's we don't really care
you know it happens it's

253
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,709
fact of life we move on

254
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,199
given that there's unsuccessful attack
now I'm he def back

255
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,459
me in a defined unsuccessful attack as
someone

256
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,970
got through the first layer defense but
didn't achieve their goal so they may

257
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,579
have

258
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,339
you know gotten through the border
routers but didn't get to their final

259
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:01,540
destination

260
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,760
so the probability that someone
unsuccessfully tax

261
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,410
is pretty hot we all have unsuccessful
attacks all the time my website it which

262
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,620
is pretty crappy website owners do is
probably getting attack right now

263
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,699
and it just happens so no

264
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,320
given that that happen that in
unsuccessful attack happens

265
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,459
so someone's bumbling around your
network what's the probably they're

266
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:24,740
gonna do something stupid and

267
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,570
drop a table months it's pretty high
it's not

268
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,459
massively I but it's pretty high so we
rate that is medium and then

269
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:36,699
we value that canelo because they didn't
succeed

270
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:39,899
this attack but that in 68 so we don't
care

271
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,970
and we keep doing this for the rest the
tape

272
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,300
so we do judgments based on what we
think

273
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,060
in addition to raw data that we have we
come up with

274
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,519
step and this is a man who were you
present your managers

275
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,920
and this form a because it's more
colorful

276
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,060
you and if you look at it there's
there's

277
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,170
kinda the pattern to the to the risk
analysis how can how

278
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,320
and when you're presenting data managers
it's very important to have a pattern to

279
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,750
your day

280
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,630
say can instantly recognized okay this
is the hot spot this is where

281
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,430
we have the most risk based on the rest
now sweet 'n

282
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,500
this is where we should focus because
generally

283
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,860
people like decision-makers won't look
at a graph and say oh

284
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,139
you know we can reduce more risky
rattled say 0 this is where the most

285
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:34,509
risk is this is where we put

286
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:38,329
all over money see you want to be able
to give them that

287
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:42,889
instant gratification of knowing this is
where we should final all over dollars

288
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,480
this is not a risk matrix if you ever
heard the term Ismet risk

289
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,790
its for put it on your mind forget about
it there's a better

290
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,910
arm yeah so let's let's

291
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,880
say that for example we took the the
last Graf

292
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,730
and only did actual hard data in terms
of the problem is that we did so we came

293
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,099
out with actual numbers that we use

294
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,559
right so we have statistics on attacks

295
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,730
and ask us where we are we can actually
have a probable

296
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,419
a problem the probabilistic chart such
as this

297
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:20,150
that shows the probabilities each's
specific event happened

298
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,160
combination now one side

299
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,350
along the outcomes concerns I do miss
notice that there are some

300
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,389
values theirs and dollars that's the
value

301
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,429
the suppose value that pull out my house
I love

302
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,120
a company recovering from such-and-such
I'll come

303
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,000
now that we have numbers that we can
work with actual hard data

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,289
and a number that we can work with in
terms of value that it weakened

305
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:49,539
revalue all of that all of the the risk
assessment that we just ate using money

306
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:52,970
instead love how managers feel

307
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,970
comes out some like this and notice

308
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,620
it shifts right the valuation we put on

309
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,620
the risk assessment you vastly changes

310
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,260
the outcome that we give so when you do
you risk assessment always make sure to

311
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,660
identify what they're looking at stuff
they're looking at how much money they

312
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,640
can save

313
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,000
use a monetary base valuations are
looking at live safe use lies base

314
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,429
valuation they're looking at

315
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:23,710
how much the episod he's how much they
pissed off as a valuation

316
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,350
now so whatever makes no sense because
thats a at the end of the day what you

317
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,160
wanna be giving them

318
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,220
you wanna be showing them in terms that
they want to see

319
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,350
risk assessment

320
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,220
so yep

321
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,679
now that that was up something called
annualized

322
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,679
loss expectancy so given that in for
example the problems were with an EU

323
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,770
so let's say the three successful
attacks 3,000 unsuccessful attacks her

324
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,639
for a year

325
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,460
and the money that you lose is within a
year

326
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,440
you can do for that year so annualized
every year how much money do you expect

327
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,370
to lose

328
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,390
from the specific event now compare in

329
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,890
that's lost that we did his question was

330
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,970
so we get the probability from adding
it's actually

331
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,590
we multiply the prowlers together having
the problems together is

332
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,600
ins never a very good idea multiplying
bro is together gives us a better idea

333
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:26,910
have

334
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,620
the actual competition probabilities arm
that

335
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,380
with the money gives us a good idea of
how much we should expect to lose per

336
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,950
year

337
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,980
so over a given period what's the
expected loss

338
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,160
and is going less than the full a van

339
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,650
but it accounts for the probably that

340
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,800
this event is gonna happen over a
certain numbers so

341
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,428
eventually it'll happen and what happens
you lose all the money

342
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:56,920
but I'll be like you lost all the money
all the apps so it's more like

343
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,270
if you shovel this amount of cash
towards me now I can fix it and we won't

344
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,220
have to worry about it like

345
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:07,030
so given that that takes a pretty
lengthy process there are some shortcuts

346
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,520
and some methodologies we can use and I
will show you a couple but

347
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,270
should be forewarned these are what we
call factor his moms

348
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,389
in fact herb is miles are great for
doing in

349
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,570
instant risk assessment I've a number

350
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,840
items but you have to be aware that only
gives you

351
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,000
relative ranking it will not give you a

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,170
definite final probability for each
event right

353
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,700
so you'll still will go through one and
we'll see how it works in a cup second

354
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,120
such as

355
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,100
there with weaker so first you have a
factor is my let's go have a number of

356
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,850
factors so

357
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:46,340
criticality accessibility on early when
I'm and you can assign a range numbers

358
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,050
to those factors

359
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,780
so like 134 try to use even numbers

360
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,490
using even numbers a as humans we tend
to use

361
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,520
135 skills we use number three whole
helluva lot

362
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,129
and that generally doesn't tells very
much about the rest

363
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,390
cell forcing yourself to use either
higher or lower number

364
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,419
will generally give you a better idea of
what you're looking at and will force

365
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:09,290
you to

366
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,290
categories the risk has higher or lower
and also

367
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,450
generally provides

368
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,980
a an impetus for figuring out if its
Hiral so it forces you to be more

369
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,860
mentally

370
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,190
prepared for that question I'm

371
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,809
the higher the number is it should point
more towards

372
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,129
the whenever the the issue at hand so if
you're looking at

373
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,790
up won the examples is how

374
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,040
much a community contributes to the
crime rate

375
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,190
so the the feelings that community
perjury her there

376
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,760
situation community contributes to the
crime within a community

377
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,950
so the more it contributes the higher
the number should be

378
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,000
so it shouldn't be that the first four
numbers all represent you know

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,740
one is it doesn't create for attributes

380
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,140
and then suddenly switches that for it
doesn't determine why doesn't and

381
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,460
it contributes is that mixes thing
outlook toward them second value each

382
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,390
factories in that range

383
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,550
and then you had a combined score so
this is my favorite one this is one that

384
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,159
the Navy SEALs use for a long time

385
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,610
call carver its for target selection so
if you land on a beach in alone I

386
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,790
and you have to take something out in
order to achieve your goal

387
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,149
and you've got a list of things you just
you use a stall and I'll give you a

388
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,070
pretty good idea I'll

389
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,409
where he should attack so criticality is
arm

390
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,380
how critical the system or item is to
you whatever you trying to infiltrate so

391
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,840
if

392
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,790
you're talking about you know you could
just picture

393
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,389
Navy SEALs on a beach in the middle of
the night there's a hacienda in the

394
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,320
distance with the lights on guards
around with ak-47s and

395
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,490
you in your scrappy team of SEALs have
to get in there and rescue some

396
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,520
prisoner and you have to first thing you
do is turn off lights

397
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,129
so criticality how critical is a power
station

398
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:04,030
up power lines already cell battery
sitting on the desk

399
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,290
the power stations me massively critic
because without you generally can't

400
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,350
get your power the power lines are kinda
critical because you know they could be

401
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,630
alternate power lines

402
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:19,090
the up the cell battery is not very
critical to be

403
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,010
house being led accessibility

404
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,530
the power station will not generally be
very accessible the power lines will be

405
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,070
massively accessible

406
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,240
the D cell battery will probably be
sitting next to some guy named pokey

407
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,870
who's watching TV i recover deleted
hours it'll take a long time to fix

408
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,960
power lines there's a string ones up D
cell battery no one really cares

409
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,810
volatility I how vulnerable is a power
stations by well defended you down

410
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,860
Scott lost a conference power lines
because Kobe got them

411
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,190
the cell battery hmm the shooter from
while a note to readers:

412
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,370
affect power station

413
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,060
power goes down done up

414
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,889
the power lines cut them power goes down
done D cell battery

415
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,390
your so you get the idea you go through
any value

416
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,250
each single one 4 whatever you're
looking at

417
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,470
and eventually come up with a number and
that number will give you a relative

418
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,600
ranking so let's do this

419
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,280
for us the next hour

420
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,730
so given that here's here's this copy is
this is just a little exercise

421
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,679
arm protectors hope staff the asset is
the joy many attendees

422
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,780
yes the enjoyment of the attendees can
be an asset and the threat is some rogue

423
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,500
attendee who Hannah was jolted and
somehow

424
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,000
so were his skill 126 6 being
contributes hi least the x6

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,470
attack success probability one being
does not contribute in the slightest bit

426
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,020
and and blesses you put a a real love

427
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,809
possible targets there so we can attack
the knocking take down the number

428
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,178
we can attacked the elevator and
immobiliser weekend attack the

429
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,330
projectors in

430
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,100
knock them out we can attacked the
segways to eat knapsack Windsor

431
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,260
axle be attacked the segways an knock
those out

432
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,540
or we can kidnap a man so

433
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,100
we evaluate each one for

434
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,110
all the all the the items and

435
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,570
surprisingly at least for this now says
the elevator will actually cosmos

436
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,730
consummation

437
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,200
and if you look at it he's my fancy

438
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,990
pointer here you look at it index a this
is

439
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,809
accessibility so how likely is it that
you'll be able to get to the thing

440
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,280
for the elevator you could just walk up
and walk in that's kinda the point of it

441
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,649
but I haven't seen a manual we have
today

442
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,940
so East not really a bell that's where
it was the most points

443
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,200
so based on all the factors you can come
up with a relative ranking

444
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,580
how like up which ones will accomplish
your goal

445
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,428
everyone with me so far excellent

446
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:00,890
here's a couple more I'm just go from
here pretty quick evil done is for

447
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,679
target selection it's like armor

448
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,690
but different D sharp is known for car

449
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,059
for target selection a

450
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:13,260
its it's a little bit more on history
crave

451
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,408
is for attractiveness assets were
talking like burglars so someone breaks

452
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,790
in your home which things are you think
you see

453
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,840
steel the concealable and removable a
really big in this

454
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,740
because you know walking out with the
flat screen TV is

455
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,470
not as easy as walking out with some
time rings right

456
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,710
murderous is for weapons Lexion he told
the names cannot fit with what they're

457
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,640
talking about that's kinda the point

458
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,370
that's like ninety percent of getting
your your factory smile

459
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,159
%uh agreed to buy the rest the community
is having a great name

460
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:48,640
so murderous is for weapons like to sew

461
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,840
al Qaeda wants to kill some people what
weapon to the years

462
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,080
murders is yours for Fitz

463
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,889
out this is why I was talking about for
facilitation crime for different

464
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,240
communities

465
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,919
so if it's easy save excuse what has a
warning to do crime

466
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,929
build a crime this when I cooked up this
afternoon

467
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:11,360
so how easy is it to socialize your
summer

468
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,000
what are the days it is it midnight Nate
are can sleep ears at high noon there

469
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,800
while a are the overseen by nazar to
they have some oversight where they

470
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,149
can't really say anything or

471
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:25,149
are they allowed to say where I want
pressure how much to pressure them

472
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:28,659
encouragement that this kind like that
the Karen the sticking right there

473
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:33,710
so factor is mile for social engineer

474
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,310
now when we're talking about factor is
models in and other things in general we

475
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,030
we want talking about scales as well so

476
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,340
what skill we use determines how we can
do math on the specific

477
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,560
item we're talking about I'm

478
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,720
so ice time before you know about made
him the clarity I love

479
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,919
scales sorry about the word a mate
making sure that higher means

480
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,639
thats it's contributing more towards the
excess eg towards the success

481
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,780
and lower means contribute less so

482
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,440
what about the range the scale so let's
assume factors multiples people C pas de

483
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,750
Aizawl just 134 vulnerability these
dollars in damages see is time to return

484
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,389
to operation seconds India's lives lost

485
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:22,159
for server this might make sense because
seconds out of operation could be

486
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,960
you know fifty seconds was rebooting
other stuff but what about for a

487
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,500
Christian

488
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,330
to take a long ass time to make any
Christian and that in seconds is going

489
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,189
away outweigh

490
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,480
the 134 vulnerability assessment

491
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,560
see see how choosing the right scale
making sure they

492
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,230
big the mashed together makes for
basically all

493
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,440
love the risk assessment you can sway a
risk assessment however you want

494
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,409
using the RightScale but having a
intellectually

495
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:55,130
appropriate scale is massive

496
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,260
and he'll maintain your your
intellectual integrity

497
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,389
give you a ass for that is actually
defensible

498
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:05,149
and is the key to caress risk assessment

499
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:09,380
so use race go here sometimes skills

500
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,460
there's nominal scales which you've been
things there's

501
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,050
no order no higher the apples oranges
pears there's

502
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,500
no hierarchy right it's just different
types

503
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,030
then there's or which is like I mean
life you've seen

504
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:28,810
that the Department of Homeland Security
has their red orange green purple future

505
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,960
whatever up bars for risk assessment

506
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,889
that is an ordinal scale right because

507
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:39,690
higher doesn't elevated doesn't
necessarily mean that the risk is two

508
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,320
times better than

509
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,260
batter whenever right it's not tell you
anything quantifiable about the rest is

510
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,139
just tell you that

511
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:49,250
its higher so while

512
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,630
there's a hierarchy involved you can't
do any good real math on it

513
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,280
expect to get a meaningful answer right

514
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,629
interval scale however you can do both
hierarchy calculations

515
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,690
so a threat that's a sixteen

516
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,490
are or threat thats us happened sixteen
times day

517
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,610
happens more hot twice as often as a
threat that happens it comes to

518
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,510
happens twice as much as the front dam's
four times rights you can do actual map

519
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,470
on it

520
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,080
and then a national scale is countable
items so dollars

521
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,439
human lives stuff like that so you can
also view calculations on a

522
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,899
suspends all the other I'm gonna show
you it needs presentation I gave to his

523
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,210
company at the end

524
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,490
and it brings together all the factors
that we were talking about and you can

525
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,770
see how it feels weird

526
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,490
plans together this is actual
presentation so I'm sorry further

527
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,870
the theme

528
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,639
so the problem at issue he outlines so

529
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:51,419
you get the scope in the first light so
this is what we're talking about

530
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:54,980
so attackers attended a penetrator never
to steal destroyer article

531
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:00,350
better right there tells you the threat
the protector and the asset

532
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,500
right so

533
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,399
getting that out on the first slide is
is monumental you want to make sure that

534
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,980
your your audience understand where
youre talking about and as

535
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,669
the scope the assessment they've done

536
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,690
anyone getting an idea I've what be

537
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:22,860
threat the threatened fireman looks like

538
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,340
so get this is I made that shit up cell

539
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,270
given that given what you're looking at

540
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:34,360
once the probability that can happen so
how likely is it to happen

541
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,600
what can happen how likely is it happen
you see we're going back those

542
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,159
six questions arrest we talk about to
begin

543
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,830
they want to give them something about
you know this is have no other people

544
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,230
news what's happened so what can happen

545
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,080
how likely is it happen what can happen
you know so give them something about

546
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,780
the outcomes

547
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,480
something that happened other people

548
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,139
and then you plug in your ass now since
here's the problem: leave everything

549
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:03,070
that happened here's probably what will
happen to us your house premiere

550
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,960
yeah

551
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,379
and that s it guess it's it's very a.m.

552
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:15,440
was a chick reply hamlets are like Emma

553
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,210
sup six questions

554
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,310
right we talk about these in the inning
he answered all three questions

555
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,960
in a short numbers lights so

556
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,220
in the site he answered what can happen
he gave the threats they came up with

557
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,780
how likely is it happening at the
probability is why the consequences it

558
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,658
happens

559
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:38,360
he gives the problems people the
probabilistic table

560
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,129
with the analyze loss expectancy so over
a number here's this is how much on

561
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,810
average we expect to lose

562
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,980
so now I was pretty quick

563
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,169
in doing a risk assessment there are a
number of things to remember

564
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:56,230
use common sense is the biggest one it
looks wrong

565
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,639
it usually its

566
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:03,570
make sure you check olive your slides
make sure you check all your

567
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,970
calculations make sure someone else
double checks for you

568
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,740
I've had a number of times where I've
had the wrong calculation on she'd

569
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,389
and stronger the of make sure that you
check it

570
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:15,810
make sure you scope the question because
you don't want to be sitting in your

571
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,470
cubicle for the next three years
thinking about a threat that's a year I

572
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,750
today

573
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,870
so you wanna make sure you come up with
assessments timely

574
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,340
you are make sure yours that assessment
is complete and you want to make sure

575
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,669
that

576
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:31,520
you not biting off more the kinship so
scope in question

577
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,190
is definitely something I remember using
proper skills like we talked about that

578
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,460
will make or break an assessment

579
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,010
run the six questions arrest if you
prepare for the six questions arrest

580
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,658
you're almost guaranteed have no
problems and presentation

581
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:49,389
you'll be prepared for all the questions
that probably answer ask you

582
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:53,010
factor is miles a quick and easy but
remember their

583
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,379
kinda dangerous in that you know they
don't give an absolute probability they

584
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:57,020
only give

585
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,020
arranging a probable ranking love

586
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,480
rescue scenarios and check your work

587
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,440
academic integrity before making answers
happy so

588
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,530
it happens more often than we like to
think that managers will just

589
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,030
ask for something like I want to see a
problem

590
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,810
I want to see risk assessment where X
threat is the biggest threat

591
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,520
and they'll ask you brewster and
personally I just refuse to do that

592
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,609
because my academic integrity is higher
than getting paid

593
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:32,429
and thats something that's completely
moral and we shouldn't as

594
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,210
as risk assessments individuals and IT
professionals be stooping to that level

595
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,589
arm we should be producing risk
assessments

596
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:44,350
that are based on probably is there
based on data that are fair

597
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,940
and explain all the risks and it should
be about

598
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,980
you're making certain manager happy

599
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,280
and that as best they on my slides are
up on that website

600
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,280
family has a question for you

601
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,320
yeah

602
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:12,300
you

603
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,480
in

604
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,828
he's asking about if you you've already
used arm

605
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:33,480
a risk matrix in your workplace what's a
good way to transition from the worst

606
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,270
matrix to something like this and

607
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,530
using this chart is actually pretty

608
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,950
visually similar to some other s
matrices AVC so

609
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,828
visually moving them from the risk
matrix to the probabilistic risk

610
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:46,380
assessment

611
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,119
is just as easy as changing the data
behind the church because visually the

612
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,490
managers are only care about

613
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,380
thus lies with the the grass on them
I've I've literally seen briefings where

614
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,839
you walk in and they flip to the first
page with the the graph on it

615
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,880
boom that's their answer they wanna see
they don't care about the rest the

616
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,450
announcers

617
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,740
they just one see graph so moving away
from risk matrices should

618
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,839
be pretty easy in terms love getting the
managers to sign of

619
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,308
on probabilistic risk assessment there's
a lot of

620
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:17,319
a.m. has lotta work I think that's been
done by

621
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:20,920
SRA

622
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,369
the their professional organization for
risk assessment

623
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:29,059
arm day do you really good white papers
and such

624
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:32,829
that should have a lot of information on
how to support problem was aggressive

625
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:33,680
thousands over

626
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,740
iris matrices go

627
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:43,740
%um yeah and that is the problem that we
run into mass times

628
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:48,720
so in that prop in that scenario he is
asked this question is

629
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,549
what we doing when there's no data so a
good thing to do is

630
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:55,319
if you have the proper if you have the
ability to put like a small box on your

631
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:55,839
system

632
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,240
are on your number can just watch the
data coming through so you can identify

633
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,410
okay deserter

634
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,078
attacks like a man that didn't weren't
successful these are successful attacks

635
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:04,839
get some data

636
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,630
but he can't get data you think that the
subject matter less stationed

637
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,270
subject matter expert Liss stations so
you talked a whole buncha hackers

638
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,759
about what is in your opinion the most

639
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,980
where is the most risk in terms of
attacks and then

640
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,970
you have read out what they say cell
five people say

641
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,130
Anna insert attacks here

642
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,150
for people same courtesy a certain tax
why here

643
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:37,150
free people say insert agassi its XYZ
right see

644
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,079
right so in said you use in the bay near
got nothin so you're saying okay this

645
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,579
attack

646
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:46,700
we believe that it's a high probability
that'll happen or there's a low profile

647
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,740
and yours using the the seven matter
experts that the hackers the people who

648
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,220
know it

649
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,470
and using there got and the more people
you getting that

650
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:59,299
group the more accurate your results
will be because then the more

651
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:03,829
samples will have people saying this is
the guys this is that's the one

652
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:10,829
got yes in

653
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:18,480
I personally

654
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,990
deal only with risk assessment that is
what i do. that is my trade

655
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,920
I was later I'd I don't do the follow-up
stop I have no idea how to do that I

656
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,910
haven't figured out

657
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,500
so sure her question was you know if
you've done the risk assessment how do

658
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,700
you go back to follow up to see if

659
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,099
what you've done is cracked or on track
or whatever and

660
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:46,369
generally in terms of the government
they'll go back

661
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,150
eventually eventually and I'll do
another risk assessment will see okay we

662
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,809
tracked

663
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:54,480
there is risk properly this is where the
the Cedar shifting this is what's going

664
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,780
on

665
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,910
but in companies especially that can be
really hard

666
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,290
because managers want to do a one-time
risk assessment that gets them that

667
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,130
check mark on the certification

668
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,690
for whenever they doing so PCI I think
as a a risk assessment

669
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,839
requirement or some sort and they just
want that check mark they don't wanna

670
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:11,630
follow up at all

671
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,349
so you have to hand it in to them that
this is a risk assessment snapshot right

672
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:18,140
so that it's only for this

673
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,379
specific period time and some change
hands

674
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,640
their product agree with him i'm for
that part

675
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,640
that's missing yeah

676
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,710
you

677
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:44,710
you

678
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,180
right and that's going to into risk
management which is that the next three

679
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:49,839
questions

680
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,959
which might be another talk some other
your arm and

681
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:56,469
it goes into how much can I reduce my
risk I put in this amount of dollars

682
00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:00,019
I reduce my roots this percent and
that's why use the probabilistic risk

683
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:01,640
assessment and set up the

684
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,660
factor is miles because you have a
number

685
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:11,660
you can come back to later right mean

686
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,069
we you

687
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:24,069
see I would personally I'd

688
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,989
I think there should be a a greater
mashing between risk assessment

689
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:34,529
penetration I think a penetration test
myself

690
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:37,859
is not necessarily an actual item for a
corporation

691
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:41,229
but a risk assessment based on that
penetration cast will give you a lot

692
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:41,729
more

693
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:45,069
data lot more insight on what happened
and

694
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:48,160
assessing more where okay so these are
you risks

695
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,499
this is how it affects your business
this is your bottom line I'm

696
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:56,359
cell I think a risk South a penetration
test first and then risk assessment

697
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:58,538
based on penetration test will give you
great day to

698
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,599
okay we fired excise tax we see at night
axe

699
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:05,819
your life from these types of attacks
these are how this is how vulnerable you

700
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:06,170
are

701
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:13,170
so

702
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,360
personally I think I would use two
different teams but

703
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,490
in reality with you know budgets and
such good the same person could you

704
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,220
pretty good risk assessment given that
they also did the penetration test

705
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,390
because they're the expert on the matter
they've done it they have the

706
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,500
information and knowledge

707
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,580
they're probably the best suited to do
it

708
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,590
in terms of you know knowledgeable about
matter

709
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:49,590
aka yeah

710
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,500
now

711
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:01,500
or a

712
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,329
yeah I deal with the government you know

713
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:18,950
you do risk a son he dove hunters yes
thank you and

714
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,619
I you come back later reassessment and
do they care

715
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:28,050
if I this is this comes from a Coast
Guard body in mind he walked into a

716
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,900
a briefing and someone had done a risk
assessment people probabilistic risk

717
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,450
assessment

718
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,630
and laid out on the table and at the end
the the risk assessment

719
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,450
I want the people in briefing stands up
and says this is be scrapped this

720
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,680
doesn't support what we want to do

721
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,919
for to do something else and so you know

722
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,550
in some parts the government works like
that in some companies to work like that

723
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:52,710
but it should and the more we do real
probabilistic risk assessment

724
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:59,710
more than it might hammered into their
brains that the other aliens

725
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,079
yes yes a lot it was the next generation
actually it was a

726
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,270
you there's a local horn quartet

727
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,809
that a comment and they did you know the
standard comments or concerns all that

728
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:23,730
stuff is as a walking down the aisle

729
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:27,220
and it's a it's a big cock auditorium is
a Penn State the

730
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,619
Eisenhower auditorium is huge as we're
walking down the aisle in it switches in

731
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:31,049
Psych

732
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:38,049
attorney person actually is is Star Trek
thought damn straight it was pretty damn

733
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,240
yeah

734
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,810
I have not seen his question is it if
there are any

735
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,930
semi-automated processes or programs
that will

736
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,049
take likes more dating give you a
probabilistic risk assessment

737
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:08,070
and as far as i've seen its

738
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,930
it's gotta be more human interaction
because as as we go back to the first

739
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,129
slide the first of its lies

740
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,650
its not only get the data you have

741
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,900
but he its process that was your
imagination at sea

742
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,320
the more expert you are in the field and
the more your imagination compasses more

743
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,870
of that

744
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,330
big blue box that is the universe the
better your risk assessment will be an

745
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:29,770
escort

746
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,750
a small boxes only give you the attacks
that you've already seen

747
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,700
what if the next supermodel attack comes
and it only happens once but it's really

748
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,180
fact

749
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:45,180
yeah in back

750
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,510
generally the way that the government's
worked in the past is

751
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,370
a bunch a guy sat down in a table like
three or four guys and

752
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:14,180
one guy says I think we should do axe
the other guys are like

753
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,700
well you pay my salary so I agree and
it's been

754
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,360
a sorta beating them over the head from
the top

755
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:29,030
a fact so see this is the part my job
that sucks I can't really tell you about

756
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,000
all the things I do

757
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,310
cell I can tell you specifically in
answer to your question

758
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,070
but in general beating them over the
head from the top so convincing someone

759
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,600
higher than them that they're an idiot

760
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,120
and forcing them to use the
probabilistic risk assessment generally

761
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,690
works

762
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,860
so the people higher than them if you
can get to them and show them listen

763
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,330
managers have been doing it this way but
if we do it this way ill save money

764
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,250
money is huge and it'll be more
effective that's

765
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:58,010
be and want to get them bought on the
idea your goal

766
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:05,010
dip

767
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:38,750
yeah

768
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,299
and the Black Swan raises its ugly head
not you personally this this is a

769
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:53,200
theme has been going in especially
intelligence communities for a while

770
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,680
there was a a general %uh the question
was

771
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,680
how you count for a situation that you
don't vision so things that

772
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,940
so right so that you don't have repair
Clemens disperses for

773
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,150
the probably that this will happen and
the in the Black Swan

774
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,579
at the reason I bring up his if you've
only seen whites ones in your life

775
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:23,760
you can't imagine a world where there's
a Black Swan and so you have no data

776
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,180
backup that there might be a Black Swan

777
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,460
and there's a book by a sample at that a
general

778
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,470
just had stacks up in his office and
would give out to every single person

779
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,460
came to office is at

780
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,900
we sit we we look for the Black Swan and
just sorry did nationally

781
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,520
internationally

782
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,170
so arm unknown unknowns

783
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:47,430
so in general we that's where the
imagination comes in

784
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,848
right so you can't like he was asking
you can't just take the duck the output

785
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:51,980
down from small box

786
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,220
run through a program come up with a
risk assessment you have to

787
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:00,049
Server Manager imagine World where a
supermodel virus will come along to kill

788
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:00,520
you all

789
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,329
right so you have to imagine that and
what your vulnerability would be from

790
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:09,619
so it involves sort of imagining and you
have to

791
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:12,700
when you do something like that if you
explain it

792
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,480
in your methodologies right when you're
presenting to

793
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,839
when managers or whatever arm how you
came up with this risk assessment the

794
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:22,288
first couple pages on your part

795
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:26,089
should be okay this is what we did in
detail this is how we got to these

796
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:26,690
results

797
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:30,410
this is you know we made these
assumptions lead to these conclusions

798
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:35,220
and we thought that these might happen
and if you explain it

799
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,950
up front and account for that in your
imagination

800
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,359
that will think cover

801
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:45,848
the blacks but as you know

802
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:49,619
September 11 and all the other crap it
out and we can envision ever

803
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:56,619
so she just happens yeah

804
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,230
of

805
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:11,230
I'm sorry but I cannot discuss this
topic view the national security reasons

806
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,220
arm not I

807
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:27,220
I hate my job sometimes I I seriously
can't talk about that

808
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,160
like I I just read it can talk about
that so I would love to answer your

809
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:31,799
question

810
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:37,830
kid

811
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:44,830
welcome apology accepted

812
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:52,420
please jump

813
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,870
for

814
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:03,770
said the

815
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:10,770
mean me

816
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,910
absent just saying that

817
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,940
in doing a risk assessment you should

818
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,120
you might consider including situations
that have not

819
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,259
occurred in the past if you're risk
assessment

820
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,070
if you scope it so we're talking before
about scope in question

821
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,580
self as one slides are online have fun
%uh

822
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,630
were talking before about Scott question
so if it within the scope with your

823
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,290
question

824
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,470
it comes up that you might wanna include
be

825
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,730
I situation that might happen in the
future that haven't happened the past

826
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:46,980
this Black Swan events September 11 to
the world such then

827
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,360
and you think that might be helpful this
is where be human comes and ball

828
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,400
comes into play if you think that may be
helpful in the risk analysis

829
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,820
you should probably include that but be
being the Black Swan events are so

830
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,460
infinitesimally probable

831
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,250
so minuscule in the probability that
they almost never happen

832
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:11,250
a sometimes washes them out the entire
houses

833
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:25,920
you

834
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:35,779
again this is where II his he's talking
about like

835
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,880
if you plan for one Black Swan event
another one happens what your house

836
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,370
QWERTY

837
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,880
and this is again we're being a human
comes into play

838
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,940
so if when you're thinking about it you
include these locks wanna dance

839
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,820
your including events that you're
thinking about your mind

840
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:55,660
right so it sometimes the decision
makers will actually ask you not to

841
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,109
include

842
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,520
so depending when he now says ask for
when the house is calls for

843
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,820
so if you're looking at just a risk
assessment based on current threats some

844
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,260
subtle

845
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:07,450
Aladdin the current resting or based on
threats perceived will be specific

846
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,040
West's

847
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,360
love threats that you're looking at and
I'll just stick to those less

848
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,880
I'll just keep going but the Black Swan
Inn involves a paradox

849
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,660
Sophie look at Black Swan events were
just become massively paranoid

850
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,720
and we become completely immobilized but
we don't look at Black Swan events

851
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,720
than you know September 11 Saban and

852
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,720
people die

853
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,540
for and that's definitely another two
another discussion

854
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,020
for another time I'm sorry to have to do
that to you but there's other people

855
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,210
I'd love to discuss it with you more
please come talk to me I love discusses

856
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,780
work yep

857
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,910
governor

858
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:13,910
and questions

859
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:51,340
yep

860
00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:01,500
that how do you how do you right and and
we're sure in time so I had to cut short

861
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,000
the undead he's talking about

862
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,810
so what if the past you take rates were
risks

863
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:13,130
and how do we iz how we account for

864
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,750
our deterrence how to account for the
fact that just do something changes

865
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,319
people's

866
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:20,810
ideas what they're gonna do how do we
count for happy things that people do

867
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,078
how to remodel the human mind in a way
that we can understand what to do

868
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,880
we have no idea we're just getting to
the point where he we can use

869
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,530
probability properly work were

870
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:33,170
like taking baby steps here so that's
something we have to look at

871
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:40,170
in theory

872
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,460
a risk analysis should be baked into
everything we do so every step we take

873
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,560
should have a risk now says at the
beginning and middle the end right at

874
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,549
the very least

875
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,160
so we can understand okay your address
we've been here the risks

876
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,640
we've got where the risks and we're fine
so

877
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,049
in theory everything should have a risk
assessment but I get them again you know

878
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:03,609
that

879
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:06,859
it lacks streamline my lawn

880
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:13,000
yeah have meant and now for 10 further

881
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
take college courses in statistics

882
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,660
rock called course this is six are a
huge step on this

883
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:23,890
%uh Sarma Sarma the some things on the
Parish Council's

884
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:27,049
is a professional organization I can
help you get more

885
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:30,440
training in risk probabilistic risk
assessment and things that measure

886
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,930
there are risk assessment courses their
risk assessment classes there are things

887
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:36,619
online

888
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:39,930
there's a whole buncha studies have to
look for it and I be happy to

889
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:43,329
point you in the right direction offline
because that I'm to thank everyone

890
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:45,490
okay fine
