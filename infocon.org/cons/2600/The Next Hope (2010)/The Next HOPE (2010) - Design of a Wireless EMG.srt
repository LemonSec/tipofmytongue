1
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,919
I'll be presenting today the designer
for wireless EMG system

2
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,210
prior to building this design I actually
had very little experience in

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,270
Eagle and basics S&P component however I
learned a lot

4
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,049
over the course of a year and a half
been working on this I'd still upright

5
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,290
work in progress so

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,339
from if anyone's interested in like
designing called freedom can be

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,730
releasing an open-source 0

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,839
anyone can take observer and design
whatever it take for it as well

9
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:45,480
we can this better

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,589
Co at

11
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:53,690
so this this basic a design started with
the class I took and senior

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,379
in a my junior year in Union College
which was

13
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,710
BCE 497 which was an ethics course it
was

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,210
originally intended to be as the
massacre ethics course however it was

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,299
also used to introduce us to senior
project was meant for us to

16
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,490
do research on what they were interested
in building are interested in creating

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,089
and I'd so to get a group get together
with the group my friends

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,150
Joshua Hernandez Travis well and Connor
alright let's create a much larger

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,190
senior project then

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,850
one normally would take on by themselves
after doing

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,060
multiple research are

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,220
I rather I get your presentation outline
of what I'll be presenting there's three

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,670
main parts: my presentation

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,870
which is going to be the hardware
section on what I actually designed in

25
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,500
terms of

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,140
while in terms of a while the system
microcontroller applications

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,480
and term power supply for that device as
well as USB connectivity

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,800
on the software that I used which is
it's actually a

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,830
ok are modified code the open beacon
suffer so

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,990
higher something I'm sure it seems
familiar I'm and also the application

31
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,370
states that decide which

32
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,770
arm is currently based on a protest
prototype board however

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,310
in along with the power supply for the
application stage is able to fit inside

34
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,630
and outside sting which

35
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,129
is pretty good which was would be
possible to air on the forearm

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,000
which was where original price was
intended to be one arm

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,610
original plan was to separate the
division of work between

38
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,560
myself Joshua and Connor Reilly and
Travis are working together where they

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,230
would be deferred designing a wrist
strap

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,950
that has an electrode array and be able
to pick up signals and differentiate

41
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,830
which muscles

42
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,460
the fingers are moving on joshua is in
charge of a

43
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,670
designing a 0 mine C source code that
would be able to pick up the signals and

44
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,220
analyze and determine which one

45
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,680
was working in which one wasn't however
as

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,209
that due to various reasons they were
dropped out have been working on myself

47
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,060
since then

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,530
so there are particular influences for
this design where we came across a

49
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:48,980
couple

50
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,880
really interesting articles the first is
bi directional human machine interface

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
via direct from there a connection

52
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,140
hi in this article written by Kevin
Warwick

53
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,220
cason hot Goodhue innkeeper is published
and IEEE journal in 2002

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,470
they actually describe the on a 50
micron by 50 micron

55
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,180
norrell well electrode array which was
implanted on top of the median nerve in

56
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,980
the forearm

57
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,319
this electrode array was able to receive
the collection my principles that were

58
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,560
sent to control them

59
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,250
muscles and to tell them to move and at
the same time was able to send signals

60
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,959
back

61
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,040
and two trick the brain into thinking
that has a sort of like sick sense

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,530
it's able to receives signal that isn't
actually there in table 2

63
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,810
he was able to determined that signal is
not my part of his body

64
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,870
can be able to like feel something that
isn't actually there which

65
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,080
we all thought was really awesome the
second of the to up

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,170
to a papers is thought communication
control

67
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,980
for staff to using radio telegraphy this
paper it

68
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,120
at all sees this exact same a setup
where there was a big style

69
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,040
device announced its Kevin works arm and
the implants so that the

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,569
it would move around in cause damage
when it was being pulled or what not

71
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,730
but in this talk they describe how he
was able to control a robotic hand over

72
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,410
the Internet

73
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,690
he wasn't located in New York and the
robotic arm was in on

74
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,250
England and depending on how his fingers
removing he was able to move there about

75
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,639
a Canon exact same passion

76
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,530
the same time he was able to be able to
do he was able to determine how hard he

77
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,419
was holding something

78
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,909
so he was ill able to pick up in a
without actually breaking it which is

79
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,040
seen that I'm there another thing they
lol was it were able to show with her

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,130
that particular setup is that his way
from I'll was able to get itttt

81
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,340
a simple impact of two electrodes across
the be on thereof

82
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,810
and they were able to communicate using
sort of a telepathy

83
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,380
are able to move their fingers and they
would other person the spouse would be

84
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,180
able to receive

85
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,040
sense these signals and then we will
send information back and forth

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,320
and this is actually achieve that in
ninety percent accuracy so

87
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,540
work quite well so

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,610
an introduction to a lecture my grams so
you may be wondering lecture my gram is

89
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:01,880
a

90
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,600
device that is used to pick up to
electric potential across a muscle

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,630
are and amplify it so that up
microcontroller person could

92
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,680
observe it and use it for the control of
something else

93
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,830
that chart shows a typical election my
gram signal and if you look at the

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,389
bottom

95
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,590
on the x-axis the time you'll notice
that it's actually

96
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,860
long scale so all the frequencies
involved in this era very small

97
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,500
on powerful microprocessors are really
needed for this you can

98
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,820
you could observing the MG six months
using simple envelope detection

99
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,860
I'll is the crucial in might say into
create

100
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,280
SPI interface to the NRF psych be able
to transmit the signals wirelessly

101
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,360
however

102
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,220
for digital signal processing that's not
actually a necessity

103
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,720
at a first I'll tell you about the
typical election migrant devices on the

104
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,449
market

105
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,889
there aren't many election like I'm
devices on the market like the ones that

106
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,010
do exist sorry there

107
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,280
very large and you can't really use
anywhere

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,430
or they're small but very very expensive
switch

109
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,720
the cheapest I found was that a mile
track which was four hundred dollars for

110
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,530
simple device which would

111
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,979
monitor your electrical activity and
displayed in a

112
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,449
LED graph for 450

113
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,410
yeah and the this is a device has made
in the 80's however there still

114
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,350
producing them in

115
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,750
selling them so it's it's kinda
ridiculous and I felt there was a need

116
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,880
to decide something that was low cost
open to the public

117
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,830
and anyone could use cats it's actually
really simple interface

118
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,419
um so are original design our idea for
our project was to create

119
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,380
this by directional interface we want to
create this by directional and faced by

120
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,250
using surface might like

121
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,490
are non-invasive method we didn't want
to have elections we want to have urged

122
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,290
an array

123
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,729
around the forearm so that we can
receive and hopefully send back the

124
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:49,199
signals

125
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,949
course that poses a problem there's a
lot of skin resistance so in order to

126
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:53,440
get

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,139
signals back into the body would have to
use tens of thousands of volts

128
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,870
and that would be really shocking people
that's that's a very ethical

129
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,740
so we decided to just go with that being
able to receive signals and control

130
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,820
things depending on how our fingers are
moving

131
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,870
so are project went from being by
direction on face to making simple

132
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,460
on wireless key energy system which is a
used an array

133
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,240
are on the form

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,830
I in terms of Palm my section of the
project was to create them

135
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,789
microcontroller ask side and other
transmission side so I wasn't focusing

136
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:28,130
on

137
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,630
application at first hence I have some
world sideboards

138
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,820
by that patients are crystalline put
aboard right now

139
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,460
but on in terms of my original design I
plan to use

140
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,310
a chip with large signal processing arm
mainly because

141
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,650
it it's better to have more power than
it is to be underpowered

142
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,710
and them a after doing some research I
found the pic32

143
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,389
which is a 32-bit processor so it'll be
able to: and it has its own digital

144
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,960
signal processing library built into it

145
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,250
on it pic32 also is

146
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,380
relatively low power and has built-in
USB so I wouldn't have to create any

147
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,069
sort of USB interface or use

148
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,870
any serial to USB converters allowing to
maintain size to be

149
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,870
small I'm it's a very relatively
powerful pic

150
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,710
for the transmission I decided to go
with the NRF 2401

151
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,479
which is a 2.4 gigahertz transceiver
table to send and receive packets over

152
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:22,949
them

153
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,350
2.4 gigahertz range sexually the exact
same chip that they use

154
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,660
currently our badges started with a

155
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,459
last Leicester conference action was
introduced to it and since then I've

156
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:36,419
been doing research and they found a lot
of people are using and there's a lot of

157
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,539
tutorials and support available for it
to

158
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,250
that develop your own things for and
also i'd said

159
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,500
try to focus on meeting surface mount hi

160
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,520
you the use of surface mount components
that way it

161
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,990
maintains a small size and and could be
a

162
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,930
they're relatively I'll inexpensive at
the same time

163
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,990
now this is actually my very first Eagle
schematic so this that few traces the

164
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,850
going back in

165
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,880
which isn't very need but

166
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,230
these to and the top after

167
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,279
seamus this is Seamus crystal that
amusing eighty made excluding megahertz

168
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,149
powering the pic32 which is capable of
running eighty million instructions per

169
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:19,720
second

170
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,140
figured why not fighter there's a USB

171
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,760
for appear for communicating with picked
thirty which is going to be implemented

172
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,779
in sick it's your provider on top was is
based is a very simple

173
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,810
port might impact the proper for cost
only thirty dollars but

174
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,589
you can actually program any sort
picture including the pic32 with that

175
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:42,540
I'll I have capacitors here to filter
out voltages in case there's any stray

176
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,270
voltage is coming in

177
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,310
will yeah on the left hand side you have

178
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,880
putting eight by to port on the second
bro

179
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,620
love that a bye to port I haven't been
hasn't income hasn't been implemented in

180
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,630
this design

181
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,000
however are all eight planes go into the
analog 0 through

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
7 I inputs like a controller side be
able to

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,140
receive analog signals these he's
actually

184
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,930
inputs can be reconfigured to be up but
as well so

185
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,100
since this device is meant to be act as
a transceiver you can have to them

186
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,890
and configure want to be like a robot
controller and at the same time the

187
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,750
other one would be the one

188
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,730
transmitting the signals the Secretary
on the bottom

189
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,149
a was used with for everything here
design it was designed with the standard

190
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:28,570
library that comes with people which
proved to be a problem later

191
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,880
little bit but an this is the NRF chip
that it doesn't

192
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,730
this actual package doesn't for refer to
the bottom pad

193
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,899
there's all QFN ships which that pic32

194
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,080
which them to 2401 is have

195
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,550
a pad on the very bottom above the chip
that allows you to connect it to ground

196
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,850
in reduce noise

197
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,000
however this package did not tie
anything to that

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,440
around also for the NRF I used a CMOS
clock thinking

199
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,279
its sick it be a sixteen megahertz clock
could be able to run on 3.3 volts

200
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,010
and I was intending to run it off

201
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,580
sorry about that

202
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,380
anyway house intending to run out of
batteries you noticed that on that

203
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,160
well can't really notice it but on the
actual circuit I had no

204
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,180
any sort of power regulation I was
intending to use in circuits your

205
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,120
provider port since it is tied to

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,640
positive and negative to supply power to
the device

207
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,850
we could for by down it

208
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,120
the input/output other isolators tied
directly to the NRF which

209
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,600
is the the X 14

210
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,140
this is the board design above the very
first thing

211
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,959
this package right here that's the 16
megahertz us later that I was talking

212
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:46,519
about

213
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,290
I to design my own packs for that which
if you ever have to do its

214
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,860
so that if the simple but it cause
problems later

215
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,470
if you mess-up which means knowing

216
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,640
fighter ever this part right here you
don't see it in the previous design but

217
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,390
that's actually I'm

218
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,399
a fit fuse that he used to prevent any

219
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,970
excess like voltage from burning out
circuits actually a £1m fast acting

220
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,990
fuse

221
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,380
case anything goes wrong on now sadly

222
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,680
notes here knits silk screen rating
fighter

223
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,019
at to get the circuit designed I went to
batch PCB

224
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,589
which no have you heard of but to really
good service for getting your ship parts

225
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:27,120
assigned

226
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,430
and I mean manufactured and a it spent
about a week

227
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,200
trip figuring out that I had brown s and
these edges

228
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,019
of 3 percent you can actually see this
but the bot picked it up and it said

229
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:42,589
so we can manufacture it so for multiple
like a week I was trying to figure out

230
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:44,149
why isn't this working and

231
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:48,910
eventually Africa stuff

232
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,740
is actually leaving to finally get it
printed by another thing you'll notice

233
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,519
is that over here this is actually where
the antenna would go

234
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,970
I had no idea how to make tracing tennis
so at the time so as but a little

235
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,970
hole that you would actually just solder
in a wire into

236
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,220
that would be matched the 2.4 gigahertz
thing and if he didn't like you can just

237
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,060
sleep it off in

238
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,750
eventually figure out the right what the
right lent the vid

239
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,100
fighter in a

240
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,700
in commencing the components I know for
you know how two months or so I

241
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,470
components but

242
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,910
but I found to be useful was the first
10 the Pats um

243
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,550
generally when you buy aboard it doesn't
come with the Pats beat and they are

244
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,279
they're copper treason it's easier

245
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,300
cider them too but on cider to them but
otherwise

246
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,029
you have to aligned component then apply
cider it's much easier to actually play

247
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,230
soccer before you actually

248
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,610
align the component and not the chip but
I'll review

249
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,510
after as you move the exerciser with the
copper with which helps a lot

250
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,560
on then you align the component and

251
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,050
another like a a wave doing it that
works really well as to get a ball of

252
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,070
soccer

253
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,480
onto the tip itself can run along one
side edges

254
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,880
once you have all the once you have that
side on

255
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,250
cider down here everything's going to be
bridge but you don't have to worry about

256
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,870
the right now

257
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,130
is gonna play our hopefully up but

258
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,889
once you have everything set it down on
that one side you can check all the

259
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:07,399
other leg

260
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,420
other sides to make sure that their
lines as well and once that

261
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,529
what you verified that you can apply the
Bolles art

262
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,939
every single side and that'll have the
compoz the pads I'll

263
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,420
connected to the pains even though the
mates will be bridged

264
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,480
but once you have that done you could
add just take

265
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,160
cider with and apply to the lakes
that'll suck up exerciser but

266
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,040
at the same time decided we can't touch
them area in between the pens and the

267
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,849
Pats so

268
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,670
table to get rid of all the bridges all
at the same time preventing any

269
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,769
but the same time maintaining the
integrity of this held

270
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,630
suffering the QFN was not as easy

271
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,329
i've heard rumors that you could sorry
with her citing I N

272
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:53,220
a menu to try that but I've I've not had

273
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,570
other success with that but likely I
gotta

274
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,540
hot a reflow oven at the university
knows state work

275
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,269
studying in so I was able to use that
actually sounded like you a fan

276
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,480
um unfortunately I have the only sort of
looks I had was rosin core

277
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,389
which if you use it'll leave brown crap
all around the pic

278
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,790
and it's not very close very clean
design

279
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,819
but a in terms of

280
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,620
but it's very important to use it
actually means in a sec you'll need to

281
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,170
use some kind of like to have a

282
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:31,170
clean build up

283
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,770
yeah

284
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,130
once you flexed everything you just
checked you clean it off

285
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,240
and that's just wiping it down
afterwards you just take them

286
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,460
ball summer-like be preteen the packet
in the pads just like before

287
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,560
and once I once that's done you a check
for even hi which means that

288
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,459
on you wanna make sure that with %uh
sorry that's left on the pads isn't like

289
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:56,860
varying too much because

290
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,550
if it is you might have I'm a problem
with connection between a

291
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,550
our leads the chip with actual comport
with

292
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,589
circuit board on once you

293
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:12,700
once you verify that you play affects
solder flux and you placed aligned the

294
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,020
chip

295
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,209
onto them board and though paperweight
using a hot hairy for the

296
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,050
up in I mean how to refer to it ship is
linked here

297
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,589
it's actually a hacked a reference I it
works really well but the important

298
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:25,899
thing to get from it is to

299
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,350
heat up the board first you have them
when you're using the

300
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,839
to tool you hold the tool far away from
the board until everything heat up to a

301
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,330
general at the same speed

302
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,720
and then you blasted like higher so that
I to get the solder

303
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,790
what noted and that'll actually suck the
chip

304
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,040
onto the onto the pads and you can
actually pocket and still it'll move

305
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,630
around get

306
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:52,630
it'll still be stuck in one spot

307
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,250
year and the future

308
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,059
have done given soldering with soldering
irons

309
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:12,059
has a worker

310
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,450
yeah

311
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,170
yeah I i've tried yet you have shown him
but

312
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,520
yeah this is actually the results

313
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,590
my a first word everything about it

314
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,189
that's the pic32 chip now QFN part is
here then RF transmitter

315
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,770
initial notice there's a large wire
going across because I wasn't paying

316
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,080
attention close enough to the

317
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,960
application notes the pic32 it turns out
that when the Pens needs to be tied to

318
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,560
ground

319
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,600
when using an internal regulator which
is needed for the USB thing

320
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,350
but our I was a mistake other thing a
bit

321
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,320
been accidentally when I had problems as
when I plugged in the first thing

322
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,540
Circuit City Opera per

323
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,659
programmer first thing that showed up
was side we can actually find your chip

324
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,670
it was ready to set to pick the return
as I checked this make sure that the V

325
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,420
kappa set

326
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,340
so I was like wait what's %uh vicap
eventually I found out that the cap is

327
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,030
actually a tech

328
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,240
10 micro fact Athletics beat I between
the campaign

329
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,490
somewhere over here to

330
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,950
ground which I was able to hacker
together by

331
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,140
on bridging the connection between the
cap in which is happy likely was right

332
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,050
next to one another

333
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,870
and like pins and further down a tight
the polygon to ground by scratching or

334
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,170
of a little bit here and making a bridge
outsider and

335
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,680
on a 10 metre fact: passing I was able
to make using 25

336
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,110
my perfect passers just sorry together
next to each other in parallel

337
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,170
which works and ir at that point I was
able to actually communicate with the

338
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,980
pic32 however every single time I try to
program it

339
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,460
kept giving me there that it sorry it
couldn't program the boot sector site

340
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,220
can program the configuration sector

341
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,560
I actually never solve that and knives
which since then

342
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,500
to using the pic microchannel it and
I've actually used before and has been

343
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,010
has been comfortable for me but once
they found out that the back my control

344
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,240
it didn't work that

345
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,480
want that outside to test and RF
component

346
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,700
and this was done by scratching of
papilla some

347
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,340
some the silkscreen here and soldering
wires to the comp

348
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,580
to the leads that are coming from the
and RF and

349
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,699
making our a prototype board to test
that that didn't work either

350
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,700
there was actually a problem with as a
problem with their

351
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,340
see must personally can't you see mass
foreign and RF chip

352
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,899
just doesn't register you have to use
Crystal and create turn into a resonator

353
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,390
using

354
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,680
capacitors and a resistor bit across the
Pens

355
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,150
so the lesson to learn from this

356
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,580
is don't buy using other packages a lot
on my components were from smartphone

357
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,310
so he was much it was much easier to
download the spartan package and

358
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,720
get the actual component layout for that
two millimeter by

359
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,750
2.5 liter crystal that used that would
have saved a lot of time

360
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,390
are nothing a used in the design of the
actual P printed circuit board is a used

361
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,820
are out which just wasted my time I used
autorad got seventy percent complete

362
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,840
moved a component used it again and
again be fifty percent

363
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,459
and I just wasn't really helping and
actually I found it a lot quicker to

364
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,840
place all the components yourself en
route all the traces by yourself

365
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,939
but it work it actually

366
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,670
in turned out to be Eagle yeah

367
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,800
but another thing I decided on his not
having traces running alone

368
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,610
place if you notice that I had like I'll
different angled component different

369
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,800
angle Chase is running at

370
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,060
on across the place and just didn't work
very well and I have to get to triple

371
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,490
check everything make sure that any

372
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,780
any any kind of mistakes like
overlooking something applications

373
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,500
doesn't happen most importantly for kids
which is keep it simple

374
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,770
stupid I'm for my second design

375
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,830
I decided to implement the spark from
package and I followed all the

376
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,879
applications carefully so that would
make it simple mistakes like that

377
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,990
decided to add lithium-ion paper which
is in my

378
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,230
opinion still keeping it stable keeping
it simple cuz I

379
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,370
I used a the spark fun I'll example that
they created for on

380
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,550
max-1 555 charger I was able to

381
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,600
implement that into my board and I have
it working right now

382
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,610
um I use the pic 18 of 45 4550 cuz
that's actually going

383
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,130
my controller that I think used before
and have gotten it to work

384
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,710
also I had to dip version of its I could
protect with it for the prototype

385
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,730
actually bought a

386
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,840
Sparkfun breakup ports for the NRF which
market leader

387
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,129
duco testing meantime while I was
waiting for the board to be manufactured

388
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,840
I'd capitol sings clocks and everything
I did with just a crystalline and

389
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,939
creating turning into a resonator and
added expansion ports so that on

390
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,550
I know is that a lot of the pens weren't
being used and even on the 18 for 550

391
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,300
which has less pins in the 32

392
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,250
you could still use those pens and other
designed so I just put a bunch of our

393
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,030
expressions it little subtle points we
could add stuff to

394
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,060
I'll 2.4 gigahertz chip I'll while it
like the chip antenna was implemented

395
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,280
since I don't wanna just bother lower
using the wire to test things out

396
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,379
you can adjust my for a dollar a chip
antenna that

397
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,770
it's been one package in a way I do is
use on it for two points

398
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,410
and that works actually very well LED's
I put in since I

399
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,440
kind of got them in the previous designs
for basic testing and having everything

400
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,640
work and the lesley Anne just but
mounting holes along the edges of the

401
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,520
board has

402
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,710
my original intent was to have fun the
board I'm

403
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,980
on some sort of like I'm piece of fabric
don't have its own in

404
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,560
so I acted like a bunch of drip drill
holes along the edges say could put

405
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,379
need of needle and thread through
borders actually also designed

406
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,440
I'll talk about it later but this is a
schematic at the device

407
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,710
on the bottom it talks about to enter
africans the

408
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,750
secretary for the interesting is the
exact same as before on

409
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,280
the only thing I changed was for instead
of a CMOS clock a used

410
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,379
crystal which is which solve that
problem

411
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,020
but a this is actually Basic 6 crystal
resonator

412
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,080
on top were here you gotta I

413
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,820
the USB port and the power Spy circuitry
she's over here

414
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,970
I'll for the NRF you have to use 3.3
volts so

415
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,660
even with the lithium-ion battery
lithium-ion batteries power

416
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,150
is 3.7 and that would burn out the chip
since 2.3 is the maximum

417
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:30,160
input voltage so I used the lol

418
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,760
117 Italy which is the same pan out as
the 317

419
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,150
to create my own voltage regulator to
bring it down from 3.7 to

420
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,260
3.3 a over here that is the insects your
provider

421
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,460
along with the USB port which was
implemented in there 450 as it also has

422
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,150
a built-in USB programmer

423
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,240
I mean USB port on the side you have the

424
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,850
the breakup for the analog inputs

425
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,460
as well as various other break up points
for extensions

426
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,800
this board is actually considerably
bigger than my first on a

427
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,570
without its secretary I try to keep all
components on one side since it was

428
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,250
going to be

429
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,810
since the board is actually the same
size as lithium ion battery

430
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,220
onto to lay flush with it and he'd be
able to so

431
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,710
I'll her fact strings around it on

432
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,840
since it needs to be the same size it
turned out to be a lot bigger but on

433
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,070
this site you have the

434
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,050
our with your mind input thing which
actually turned out to be a problem

435
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,340
the according to the package that
sparkles plies

436
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,970
are one side is positive and other side
is negative is actually correct but the

437
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,020
batteries that I got from Sparkman had
the wires backwards so the first time I

438
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,030
plugged it in

439
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,200
the my charger blue an ETA get new ones

440
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,450
on I do know for a fact that the why

441
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,110
batteries were backwards because at some
point I was fixing my brothers

442
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,270
PlayStation 3 controller in that happen
to have the exact same battery with the

443
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,930
proper wiring further

444
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,170
wires actually have it here and would be
commissioning downstairs package based

445
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,890
village if you're interest in checking
out but I'm

446
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,270
and this idea you've got the analog
input ports expansion port

447
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,379
another extension point appear its
simple but

448
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,880
um year

449
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,480
mom else realize that not everyone could
cider QFN thing and

450
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,730
it the only times that you can actually
do it reasonably is with the hot air

451
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,600
refer to

452
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,170
so I created an alternate version that
doesn't use any other

453
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,900
QFN parts and instead you can buy I'll a
prototype your

454
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,840
protect from my smartphone and just plug
it directly into the spot import

455
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,370
and the slides up on one thing I have I
didn't do but wasn't really a problem is

456
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,630
identical any other

457
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,050
voltage regulation it's not needed if
used to protect board it actually has a

458
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,419
I'll regulator from five holes to 3.3 by
I'd

459
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,670
decided but I left it in which actually
didn't cause any problems cuz I just

460
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,090
shorted

461
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:53,350
all the wires and just created a up for
directly from 3.7 to the rest the second

462
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,400
this is my prototype for the design it's
just a

463
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,550
standard that thing with the prototype
from smartphone

464
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,610
available I got it like it's very simple
connection I gotta do is just connect of

465
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,560
wires directly

466
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,850
and on it works

467
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,270
for the prototype I was actually testing
it with an open beacon USB

468
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,980
which is a device that was meant for the
open be can't experts and so using the

469
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,770
same things I just modified

470
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,230
channel anthem took out anything
corruption and I was able to

471
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,440
receive signals from her prototype this
is actually my billboard

472
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,500
which I be showing its everything's
layout and same fashion as that

473
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,780
printed circuit board on the bottom have
them Japan China

474
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,899
and the polygon was cut off so that it
wouldn't restrict any the transmissions

475
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,270
on

476
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,400
you can decide since in this board
unlike the previous first design

477
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,040
I actually have the top polygon tied to
ground

478
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,149
this is an alternate version

479
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,370
anyway so my successes and failures with
this design work I was able to create a

480
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,380
working pics 0

481
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,060
I'm actually able to get chain
transmission back and forth from the pic

482
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,830
and from the other versions have two
working ones

483
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,179
within my power does work on I haven't
been able to get to charge from USB

484
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,300
as they don't have any ups after that
runs USB right now so

485
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,420
the a computers only help putting one
hundred millions to

486
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,160
supply power to the Vice however to
charge properly uses 500

487
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,660
and as such it doesn't charge properly
unless you have one of those

488
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,270
wall outlets to you 5 alt captors I'll

489
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,500
the things I didn't work very well as
deleting linebackers

490
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,700
battery was backwards kinda burnt on my
designs

491
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,570
I still had like Ste come at one point
like during the design of the

492
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,189
version with the QFN I put it together
and they had the fuse

493
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,730
bridge so that I can actually have power
to the the entire device

494
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,290
however I noticed that there was a short
between the positive in the voltage

495
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,100
other

496
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,220
net positive and negative in ICSP and
that turned out to be a glitch that

497
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,920
eagle had out there was actually a
straight race in my design

498
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,260
that was connecting the positive
directly to the crafted ground

499
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,300
which cause that short and on that could
have

500
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,080
there was easily fixed by using
executive discretion of but

501
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,600
until then I actually had no idea what
was going on and I was showing other

502
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
components however

503
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,480
likely nothing blue the USPS haven't
been to has been tested since seven

504
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,390
training from a foreign and so the
mountain mounting holes is when you

505
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,170
working with Eagle everything looks a
lot bigger than it actually is

506
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,240
sonya get it manufactured its morning
like wait a second I don't expect it to

507
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,460
be this small so

508
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,540
have a couple of small holes that like
you can see light through but the

509
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:33,379
little pinpricks can actually get any
threat 30 min it they're useless

510
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,360
anyway so introductions my code is I
based around the open beacon software

511
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,740
designed by English maniac I E I am
committed at the config files and

512
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,560
command scheme which was used to sense
commands to the NRF

513
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,710
and to get to do things that you wanted
to um

514
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,950
I modified the pic 16 have tax code that
was used

515
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,680
and I added analog to digital conversion
ads like ATC read

516
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,460
function into the pics 0 table to
receive analog voltages from there

517
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,820
our external sources and converted into
digital

518
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,960
valley that the microcontroller could
work with or

519
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,980
or in rather in my particular design I
had the microcontroller

520
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,440
analyze the analog to digital bar pulses
and put it into the packets at the open

521
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,190
beacon sends out there's actually two
reserved bytes

522
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,540
and those 2i just filled with whatever I
read in from analog

523
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,750
first and what port

524
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,410
then I just design my own code for
receiving signals with 18

525
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,270
for 550 as that hasn't been done on the
pic processor

526
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,440
the receiver I have been using until I
had until they had to work in boards

527
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,410
have been using them open began USB and
that was programmed with gcc

528
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,360
and now the arm development costs an arm
9 based

529
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,310
board which is actually very confusing
cuz I don't know much about that

530
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,340
but now with modifications over them

531
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,420
I also change the channel 242 so it
wouldn't interfere with any future

532
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,290
hopson

533
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,510
for from I don't know what particular
channel this one is working on but if it

534
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,960
if it is 42 then I'll be changing that
too

535
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,200
on left hand side on the bottom use
either a code for the

536
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,300
reading in analog voltages from pic and

537
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,530
from there right tie it in with the
caller ID so that when the

538
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,639
the device transmits the open beacon
package

539
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,340
transmits the whole idea as the analog
voltage readin

540
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,190
I for amplification I'll there's two
main sources that are used for figuring

541
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,500
out how to do this it was a

542
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,750
many kg source on important thing is
that

543
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,140
ekgs little really just monitoring the
electric potential

544
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,140
above the heart so it's really just
typeof EMG signal and you could use the

545
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,670
same sort of cation single sport pkg

546
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,800
as you do 80 mg I tried multiple designs

547
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,300
I'll they found in the kg and some sorta
work by

548
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:54,500
on eventually I founder resource to a
lab that was talking about how to design

549
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,170
how to build a simple EMG circuit and I
was able to

550
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:02,250
refer to an old text book that had for
creating a differential amplifier

551
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,740
which will be shown soon but mean the
important things is to have a high input

552
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,380
impedance

553
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,490
since there's no like your body is not
actually a battery can't provide signal

554
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:10,940
that a

555
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,820
high current on it's important in that
draw a lot of kind so that you don't

556
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,740
distort the signals coming in from the

557
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,210
actual muscles on differential up fire
is used so that you're rejecting any

558
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,410
other sort of signals that are inside
your body so

559
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,680
gonna be picking up an antenna signals
and just though

560
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,980
voltages across the two electrodes are
placed on your body are being amplified

561
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,260
are you want approximately 200 gain
which down

562
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,330
since EMG signals are in the five
microphone range could be easily

563
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,949
converted into vaults

564
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,610
and grounding electrode is a good
electrode is extremely important which

565
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,470
in my case I just had a watch on the
same hand they just tied that to ground

566
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,730
which worked really well

567
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,960
on for the grounding electrode it's
important to place the grounding

568
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,970
electrode on top of a bone

569
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,520
which for an area that has very little
muscle because

570
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,600
that way the any muscles in that area
will be producing stray signals to

571
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,400
did I'm ruined your differential
amplification

572
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,490
this is actually a schematic of the
differential and fire got this from said

573
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,600
Ryan Smith microelectronic circuits

574
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,550
I'm the if you notice there's actually a
resistor between the negative

575
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,560
inputs op amp that resistor insures that
you have your

576
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,340
fine just the difference between the two
normally on you'd have

577
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,540
resistor tied to ground to ground

578
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,310
by by getting rid of the ground you
armed the voltage coming in from

579
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,110
positive from the two positive sides

580
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,490
is equal to the voltage at the negative
and therefore your only amplifying

581
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,670
the the differences between the two I'm
you

582
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,890
the second part is just a simple
amplifier

583
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,350
are in terms of actually testing this I
use the microphone input

584
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,520
I I have the proper over protect board
set up for

585
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,900
to be working inside of this Alto its
case

586
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,220
I use two 9-volt batteries to supply
power to it and

587
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,020
I used a micro the microphone input from
a computer to read the signals

588
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,090
into on audacity and from there I was
able to actually observe

589
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,750
EMG signals whenever I would contract my
muscles I could be showing that

590
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,810
downstairs to

591
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,639
um yeah and Islamic militants that's
basically what I've done so far

592
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,290
and feature fish Oracle the designing

593
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,870
I'll be reading those signals into their
make controller and two using that to

594
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,630
control things

595
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:28,630
any questions

596
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:35,040
by micro factors

597
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,040
um 1816 are the two my perfect passers
together I just measured it

598
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,730
and it showed to me there was a good
exactly 10 microphones

599
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:49,000
so the yeah

600
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I don't have a downstairs bedroom and
smile

601
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,480
um I've always been using pic so I've
just been used to it and

602
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,949
some are with me choose pic and Hannah

603
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:18,359
RFID chip chip instead ovum art we know

604
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,770
and thereof from experience

605
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,639
on the NRF um I found a lot of support
for a available online

606
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,670
its 2.4 gigahertz meaning it could be
used internationally and

607
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:33,510
that doesn't impose any restrictions arm
and I

608
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,810
I father was like a brother to the Clean
System on

609
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,730
for the pic I've just been using it for
a long time so been grown accustomed to

610
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:47,730
it yes

611
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,950
what I've the research I've done showed
told me that like that

612
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:03,549
on the Ste the moment you can track your
muscles or the lot modem us is activated

613
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,770
there's a pulse but it still like it
maintains that while they're being used

614
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,619
however the results I've

615
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:12,260
our seen on show that like the moment
you contracted

616
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,950
H there's a large polls and afterwards
even if you

617
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:21,180
maintain your muscles flexed nothing
really appears it doesn't seem to be

618
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:28,180
seems to look at the sea source s

619
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:42,310
him

620
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:54,069
him

621
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:58,480
me

622
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,740
yes

623
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,800
I've been focusing on the forearm so
i've only

624
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,490
measured it with that I've tried users
into kg to monitor my heart but

625
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,480
I'm not sure figure out the proper
placement for that cause and getting

626
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,220
signals from that

627
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,710
any other questions

628
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,930
thank thank you
