lightning and about and will monitor
that

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,390
your get a response back if your
lightning talk has been non

accepted up next we have %uh the talk of
it for himself

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,590
psyche profit talking about owning your
own phone

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,270
%ah thank you it's a good to be back in
New York City

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,160
%uh for the next up I thought the last
one was the last one but

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,770
turns out it was just the one before the
next one on

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,399
so if you're left over from the last
strike at this

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,640
talk unfortunately that doesn't have
anything about

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,590
sacks or dong sir phone sex tongs or
anything like that it's kinda

33
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,190
abhi ish sorta ish drive a

34
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,539
history lecture I & phones stuff but

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,580
if you like phones then you're in the
right place so

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,039
cool my I'm T profit I'll a freak

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,250
%ah thats the kinda person that likes to
play with phones

38
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,820
I write a column for 2600 magazine
called the telecom and former

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,060
us so if you do you read the magazine up
it's not online

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,660
but it's printed on dead trees and stuff
you can buy in the back

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,980
on every issue I have this so

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,560
column I do it had a cranky persona for
nearly retired telephone employees

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,420
obviously

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm like quite there yet myself but

45
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,610
unite read it try to be faithful to that
on I believe technology gives people the

46
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,390
power to change the world a very
strongly believe this and that's a part

47
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,780
of why we're all here

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,660
and I believe the people accomplish the
most really when they build communities

49
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,270
and so the stock is as much about phones

50
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,840
as about communities and the direction
that I think that we as a hacker culture

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,090
need to go

52
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,880
us so their spend a really incredible

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,090
revolution that's happened in my
lifetime and in many of your lifetimes

54
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,150
on spend disrupt disruptive it spent
destabilizing but for one I wouldn't

55
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,470
have it any other way

56
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,940
on and what's happened is that we

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,239
as a result of having very cheap very
available communication technology

58
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,340
available to us

59
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,440
I'll by having resources like the
internet available

60
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,820
we've been able to communicate in ways
that we weren't able to be four and its

61
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
lead in a very real way to

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,470
actual political revolution among them

63
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,620
the Orange Revolution and the Ukraine
other Rose Revolution in Georgia which

64
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,850
supplanted a very brutal dictatorship
with an actual

65
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,440
supportive mostly functional democracy
and not

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,609
in the bush administration sense on

67
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:56,440
there sa bennett you know you'll hear
more tomorrow about we keep wiki leaks

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,720
and some of the things that

69
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,170
%uh for that resource has made possible

70
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,450
and of course %ah for incredibly
disruptive at least in terms of how we

71
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,459
deal with

72
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,880
content and you know being in the
publishing industry

73
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,440
ourselves at 2600 we've had to come to
grips with things like that tore at

74
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,670
and the Internet I as part of this

75
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,120
communication digital revolution us so

76
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,440
on it hasn't always been this way and if
I

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,340
government Telecom's and Sarah Palin
have their way at night not always be

78
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,080
this way

79
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,450
us so what we're gonna get to is a
little better

80
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,320
you know a rewind and I'll be talking
about what things were like

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,580
kind of when I was a kid there's a big
period in the middle that we're gonna

82
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,810
skip over because it's I kinda lost
decade I think

83
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,580
and then we'll get to now and a call to
action as to why I think we need to go

84
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,530
on sir twenty-five years ago roughly you
could communicate with virtual at on

85
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,180
Amity

86
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,700
and a way that is not possible now and
here's what I mean by that

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,229
on when you make phone calls there were
things like class features

88
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,750
I and a class feature is things like
caller ID and call waiting and voicemail

89
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,260
out there was no communication systems
since for law enforcement acts so

90
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,280
if the government wanted to tap your
phone or monitor your movements it was

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
actually from a technology perspective

92
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,109
a very difficult thing to accomplish
they had to do real work send somebody

93
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,040
somewhere

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,650
to clip into the frame and you know have
a have a real to reel recorder going

95
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,030
I'm some areas even stole used analog
switches including Seattle where I grew

96
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,889
up when I was a little kid I i

97
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,730
would call the Seattle Public Library
storyline and

98
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,230
you know I would hear the unusual
clicking and ringing and wonder what

99
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,400
that was and

100
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,340
you know was later when I got toward the
end development re school went to middle

101
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,990
school but I really learned what

102
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,770
what those switches were and started to
hear them go away

103
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,900
and in 1984 the bell system was broken
up but one of the things that we

104
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,240
I really need but don't pay as much
attention to is perhaps we should is at

105
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,310
that time there were a lot of
independent phone companies and they did

106
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,330
innovate and interesting ways

107
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,830
but you had on in Oregon a number of
telephone cooperatives that were

108
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,070
community-owned

109
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,680
and they were actually way out in front
for the bell companies in terms of the

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,690
features that were available to their
customers

111
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,660
and of course there were other things
going on in other parts of the world

112
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,400
that france in particular with their
groundbreaking many tell

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,040
which in many ways is so kind of the
predecessor to what we now know as the

114
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,130
internet so

115
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,460
there was an evolution and that
evolution was spray significant up

116
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,960
I think probably the most groundbreaking
thing that happened

117
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,040
was in the late 80s I sprite built the
first nationwide fiber optic network and

118
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,870
so for the first time

119
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,760
it was possible over the same class in
the ground to

120
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,050
March voice data and video all over one
network

121
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,030
I we began to see over the years analog
switches retired and replaced with the

122
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,580
shit all

123
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,770
I as I mentioned before and also as I
mentioned before class features were

124
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,690
added and but that became more or less
universal

125
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,790
a party lines which in summer the
independents in the rural areas were

126
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,400
still commonplace I even as late as the
early 90s

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,880
began to be retired %uh we sought
touchtone service added

128
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,630
first is an extra cost service I and
then standard

129
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,620
we saw voice messaging and we saw
Centrex become available

130
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,710
and we speak and to see some long
distance competition

131
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,070
and all love you know that anytime we
have something new

132
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,020
available that's a lot of new things for
freaks and hackers to start trying to

133
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,830
figure out

134
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,880
how to take apart and use in different
ways

135
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,120
and so

136
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,030
this gets us into the 1990s which I
think we're the most disruptive Lee

137
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,810
innovative decade in human
communications really sets the invention

138
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,010
the telephone

139
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,320
we saw equal access and we saw
competitive local exchange carriers so

140
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,659
what this man to

141
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,620
was instead of only using AT&T for your
local and long distance

142
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,850
on and you know AT&T me so that's office
Pacific Northwest fell one

143
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,320
bellsouth and and other our regional
bell operating companies

144
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,290
post the 1984 divestiture but really

145
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,600
it was affectively one network still
even though there were different

146
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,440
corporate management structures

147
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,089
when we got under the in into the
long-distance space

148
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:40,130
there was a further break up an AT&T had
to allow competition

149
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,740
up for long distance so we saw companies
like MCI

150
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,959
companies like all that companies like
spread

151
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,600
become available not just through
dialogue around services

152
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,190
but actually you could pre subscribe
your home telephone

153
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,959
to an alternate long distance carrier we
begin to see

154
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:04,019
with the explosion a personal computers
and interest in PBS's and

155
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,519
like many tell in France PBS's CN the US
and much of the rest to the world became

156
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,750
to some degree the predecessor of what
we now consider the Internet

157
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,720
2600 magazine was really at the
forefront of this curve

158
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,769
and I had a service call above 2600
Voice PBS

159
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,310
up the 2600 Voice PBS was particularly
interesting because you didn't even need

160
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,540
a computer to call

161
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,120
anybody with the telephone could anybody
with the payphone

162
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,709
editor for a device called the red box
could and so what you really ended up

163
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,750
with was

164
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:42,430
this amazing equalizing factor on the
2600 Voice PBS their side

165
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,990
a guy who would call and on who was
developmentally disabled didn't know the

166
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,160
computer was from a poor family and I

167
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,250
upstate New York on aim to make a delete

168
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,730
one of the best freaks that I've ever
talked to work dealt with

169
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,140
I he was fantastic but social
engineering he knew a tremendous amount

170
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,220
about how the phone system worked in the
background who to call

171
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,310
I do accomplish things and this is
somebody who

172
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,069
most people would look at as a retarded

173
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,120
not let's be frank on

174
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,629
a service like the 26 404 s PBS

175
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,110
really allowed even somebody

176
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,019
who nobody would take seriously the
ability to communicate with other

177
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,519
like-minded people

178
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,519
I we had cops and I give a talk couple
years ago on

179
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,149
called freaks cops n chale I think it
was here

180
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,360
I'm so its online feel free to refer to
that

181
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,550
if you want to a more in-depth look at
the cops seen

182
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,160
but this i really think was a very
important part

183
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,379
a freaking culture and even remains
today to be a fairly important part a

184
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,629
freaking culture

185
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,589
and this gets to with the community
peace which are getting to you later

186
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,529
a it was possible to perform new me
elaborate prank calls it turns out that

187
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,589
if you have all of the services that you
can break into like voice mail boxes for

188
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:04,589
example

189
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:09,550
on and people trust those services soup
which they perhaps shouldn't

190
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,550
it became very easy to convince people
to do things

191
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,730
that they shouldn't necessarily do in
the more things change the more they

192
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,889
stay the same

193
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,420
and so we'll get to that later and in
the nineteen ninety is one of the other

194
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,899
destructively innovative a things that
happened

195
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,610
I was on the government and regulatory
side and

196
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,819
this actually was the predecessor to
what we see I

197
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,259
a lot of governments around the world on
no matter what

198
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:42,069
whether democracy sir not up try to do
in terms of controlling content

199
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,790
call the air was the foundation at the
infrastructure to control communications

200
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,899
and it handed the government that
control the communications for

201
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,040
assistance for Law Enforcement Act and
if you go to asks you Alea

202
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,339
I dot con that's one by the FBI it's a
site for carriers to you understand how

203
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,480
to implement

204
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,480
on this lot there is literally a back
door built into

205
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,980
every telecommunications network that
our first public

206
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,540
telecommunications services in the
United States

207
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,290
this backdoor is built in fundamentally

208
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,730
in the background at the government
doesn't actually have to do any work to

209
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,620
tap your phone anymore they can do it
all. remotely

210
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,620
through a remote monitoring in dial

211
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,970
they just dial up a voicemail box at a
red pen

212
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,430
and they can enter the number they want
to monitor and listen to what you

213
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:41,069
are saying and it goes even a strep step
further than that now because with

214
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:43,170
wireless communication networks

215
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,300
all you have to do to track the location
if somebody if you're 14 Smith the

216
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,319
physical location if anybody

217
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:52,599
even sitting in this room is like unto a
web page

218
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,879
and the true extent up this came out

219
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,029
recently when I it was discovered that
spread

220
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,879
had responded to literally over a
hundred thousand requests for location

221
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,730
data

222
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,350
I and provide at this site on their
website to law enforcement

223
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,559
this is infrastructure that's been
implemented now

224
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,660
it is monitoring everybody potentially
now

225
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,379
any accountability is very limited
because in the bush administration this

226
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,519
dramatically got expanded

227
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,809
so there's been an evolution

228
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:33,149
%uh and there was also an evolution in
the ways that hackers

229
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,619
oz began to look at telecommunications
networks and use them

230
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:42,809
so we had things like PBS's but if you
wanted to call a PBS outside if your

231
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,699
local calling area and it was all three
dial up at the time

232
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:50,559
you would need to make a long distance
call obviously if this could be quite

233
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,410
expensive

234
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,199
by I don't know I how many if you were
around then but

235
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,639
just a quick show of hands who's ever
gotten a long distance bill more than a

236
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,730
hundred dollars

237
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,759
okay so over audience obviously

238
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,180
on you know the for those have unique
guy who are younger probably you'd be

239
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,339
shocked that

240
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,360
there wasn't such a thing as unlimited
free long distance from your landline

241
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,699
that just came standard on it used to be
you paid by the minute

242
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,180
and you could pay an awful lot by the
minute I'm so

243
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,180
we as freaks a good look at ways to get
around I how it what

244
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,579
how I how we would have to pay so much
for these calls and you know calling

245
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,339
cops

246
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,490
similar story so blue boxes get a lot of
press

247
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,149
and blue boxes stability and if the
eighties in the beginning in the

248
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,779
nineties support in Essen

249
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,800
brought uses they were in the seventies
on

250
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,040
and early 80s but you could still use
them on C-five networks and what that

251
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,248
was his

252
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:53,470
if you could get if you could hit air
routes that would go over satellite net

253
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,149
didn't cost you anything

254
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,059
you know this is a thumbnail sketch it's
really more complicated than this but

255
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,149
if you could make a free call that hit a
satellite in some way and that satellite

256
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,769
you see five signaling

257
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:09,470
it was relatively easy then to seize a
truck and go out from the other end

258
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,059
and so it was fairly popular to do this
from

259
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,249
on you know certain countries in Asia
and

260
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,519
in Israel until they upgraded to a
fiber-optic link

261
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,800
on but that wasn't very practical for
calling PBS's because you get so much

262
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,360
wind noise side you know transiting
through an international location

263
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,779
up you know there was no error
correction at the time that

264
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,559
really it was only useful for four hits
and even then only if the delay was

265
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,579
acceptable

266
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:40,970
on so around the time that I started
getting active the preferred way to

267
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,209
commit to a fraud was coats

268
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,600
and the overcoats was written you know
in code

269
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,670
I k0 t3c year something along those
lines

270
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,439
and code was was either a

271
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:59,089
and open tee support on a PBX that maybe
you found by scanning

272
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,509
whether it was a stolen credit card or
stolen calling card

273
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:08,329
or sometimes I'll bond distance
companies would use

274
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,720
if they give you a discount if you
didn't you see full access if you dialed

275
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,110
a local number and

276
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,019
entered the code and then dialed the
number that you wanted to call on

277
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,689
you could get a cheaper rate if you did
it that way so if that were to leak

278
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,420
um while you know maybe it could be
useful to freaks

279
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,420
and then there was this entire where the
scene there so we're seeing today

280
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,470
I wheres being pirated software if
you're not in that scene

281
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,559
and remember back at the time we didn't
have the internet so to move these

282
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,559
things across the country somebody had
to call long distance for

283
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,990
you know to the next city over BDS two
pts

284
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,860
and these guys were called whereas
careers and Wesker yes we're always

285
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,499
looking for codes because they didn't
want to pay long distance build upward

286
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,579
although where's

287
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:56,369
are so if you were a freak you could
have all the where she wanted really

288
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:59,970
just by supplying where scorers with
code and this is something that was

289
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,110
comment

290
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:06,880
so in addition to just outright stealing
other peoples information you know some

291
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,069
breaks a bit more ethical than others
and on

292
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,750
I would put myself in this category at
the time and you know hopefully the

293
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,480
statute of limitations is up

294
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,490
by having then you know twenty-some-odd
years ago at this point but

295
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,309
I'll I I thought I I thought at the time
that

296
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:29,850
if somebody got a bill as a result of
something I did that I wasn't being a

297
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,139
very good freak

298
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,170
I wasn't being very good from the
perspective of number one somebody

299
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,590
getting off for a bill that I ran up

300
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,439
was probably going to be pretty mad and
the phone company

301
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,890
itself would probably be pretty mad as
well and also you know these things

302
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,820
didn't end the last very long

303
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,240
so oh what many freaks would try to do
is weed

304
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,320
obtain service in a way that it would
only generate phone

305
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,730
I have billing internally to a phone
company I'll

306
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,920
were it would be just an outright
subscription fraud

307
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,100
us so there would never be a real bill
that what you real per cent

308
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,290
on so one example of something that
wasn't that

309
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,840
what's you know identity theft is a very
common thing today

310
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,649
and you know it tends to be drug addicts
that are doing it now because it's a

311
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,640
relatively easy thing to do

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,980
but you know ten years before that
became commonplace freaks were

313
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,830
committing identity theft up
corporations

314
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,439
on and so one such number was one eight
hundred jail bond neck out rather do up

315
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,159
a caf and what that was was an
attachment

316
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,679
to an existing account so some company
had a very large account with a lot of a

317
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,010
hundred-numbers and a phone call away
and not to the telephone company serving

318
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,480
them

319
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,980
%uh ordered a new number to be added to
that same ok account

320
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,960
and you know just like that %uh a new
number was nailed up to a cop from this

321
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,600
was

322
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,850
you know that's that's what are the more
memorable numbers but there were lotsa

323
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,730
lotsa lotsa

324
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,289
these things that happen on another
example of a subscription fraud

325
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,850
how many have you would take an order
from a company called scam

326
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,440
modeling no nobody

327
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,010
on well with a name like that how could
you go run

328
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,679
up unfortunately for Sprint

329
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,059
I'll they did accept an order from a
company called scam modeling

330
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,750
on yea there's a certain a freak that

331
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,590
wasn't me had set this up by i'd never
do anything at RBS

332
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,928
but on anyhow I this is that the the
story apparently where to

333
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,000
that scam modeling had offered by Shiv

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,440
Russian models that frequently needed to
call home to Russia

335
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,350
and so they needed calling cards to do
this and you know

336
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,190
because they be traveling all over the
place that there might not be paid

337
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,390
exactly on time and so

338
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,899
you know the cards would need to stay on
for long periods in between polling and

339
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:02,500
somehow you know the person that set the
site managed to negotiate

340
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,710
10 calling cards being sad up for a
large large number

341
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,960
you know thousands of dollars worth it
calls a to Russia

342
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,039
on and the bill just never being paid
and eventually a few months later spread

343
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,879
caught on

344
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,169
on and shut down scam modeling but

345
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:21,720
on for whatever reason they accepted the

346
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,039
the order it said I don't get it but
this is these are some

347
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,950
these are some methods that freaks would
use to get around going and

348
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,640
you know that the real point here is
that

349
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,610
until the internet came along and it
really became popular

350
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,470
people still found ways to communicate
and they still found ways to communicate

351
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,240
for free

352
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,630
and things happen as a result a free
communication

353
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,510
better pretty important yeah

354
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,049
some cigs something I missed a shot

355
00:20:54,049 --> 00:21:01,049
spiritualists so

356
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,059
along came the Internet and there was

357
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,928
sometime this a bit %uh not
understanding from certain

358
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:12,950
alaskan politicians like Ted Stevens

359
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,429
on understanding what the potential was
so I'll

360
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:22,330
in it's not like a truck but on okay so
this is the one

361
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,460
thing that's sorta parallels the
previous stock

362
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,149
up foreign companies really had no
understanding no trouble at all

363
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:30,769
understanding the potential

364
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:34,269
up the Internet and so when you look at

365
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:38,230
any technology that get striven on

366
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,870
and it happens to be around media if the
porn industry isn't behind it typically

367
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,169
it doesn't happen

368
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,460
so we begin to see a lot of streaming
video and

369
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,669
really I'll what got us from dial-up I
think to broadband

370
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:56,679
is streaming born %ah suddenly a free
instant worldwide communication became

371
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,889
possible and

372
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:03,070
a guy named Bernie Ebbers I envisioned
integrated voice data and video and

373
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,470
bernie is a really interesting story he
up

374
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,029
started a company called worldcom he had
this vision a police state a video

375
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,510
actually being

376
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,720
an integrated service that he'd offer
any literally what made a whole bunch of

377
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,760
acquisitions

378
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,809
I in order to put a company together
that would do this

379
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,730
there was only one problem and that was
in order to make the acquisition see

380
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,799
committed massive accounting fraud

381
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,668
I'm and the you know that resulted and I
a N

382
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:36,470
mister roberts. landing and a federal
penitentiary where he still lets but

383
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,070
the vision was good and Rio and it
actually is

384
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,100
you know oh where we use sort of more or
less

385
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,080
are today where if you look at something
like the Comcast Triple Play for example

386
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,830
you can get an integrated voice data and
video package

387
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,269
all from one provider up bernie ever saw
that

388
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:00,510
ten years before you could buy ad and
it's really because if groundbreaking

389
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,250
pioneering work by people like em

390
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,700
that we are able to enjoy some of the
services that we are today

391
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,460
on I think I've 2000 to 2010 largely as
a lost decade

392
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,059
and so that's why I haven't focused a
great deal

393
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:24,460
in this talk on by anything except you
know 1990 to 2000 and then where we are

394
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,480
today

395
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,809
on the tech crash caused up

396
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:34,340
a serious player back in innovation
around 1999 things got very property

397
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,720
on we saw for a very large amount of
investment in companies that should

398
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,799
never have been started

399
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,158
Dutch selling products that shouldn't
have existed

400
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,250
on and you know we all saw the logical
conclusion up

401
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,539
the pullback was more severe than it
should have been

402
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:57,289
and so the amount of innovation that I
think that we've seen

403
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,639
really in the last 10 years hasn't been

404
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,870
to substantial it's mostly been
evolutionary

405
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,029
except for surveillance and we put this
crazy massive surveillance

406
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,100
infrastructure

407
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,750
without really even thinking through I
what the social implications for the

408
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,710
long-term implications

409
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,100
are up this man radical societal shift
that's happened

410
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,549
on but there were some things that
happened we do now have

411
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:27,019
a GSM deployment in North America %uh
and

412
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:30,610
it more or less I covers the majority of
the population

413
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,700
we didn't have this before we saw amps
retired

414
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,919
toward the end love the lost decade

415
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,049
I amps was the at the old and a crackly
analog cellular network

416
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:47,139
we no longer have that we suck growth in
VoIP services but the interesting thing

417
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:47,669
with boy

418
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:51,690
if you ask me three years ago what the
most exciting

419
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,779
groundbreaking trend-setting thing would
be in telecommunications

420
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:59,480
up you know in they in that decade I
would say play

421
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,669
and the reason why was there was a lot
of really exciting things happening

422
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,909
around flight

423
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:07,779
I it was possible for us says peaks and
tinkerers

424
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:11,279
take get access to some very very very
cheap

425
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,220
up with services and even today there's
things like magic jack where you can

426
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,309
call anywhere in the country for
basically for free

427
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,860
with certain limitations and I did write
a column on magicJack a few issues back

428
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,269
on and I believe the back issue is for
sale so

429
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:30,289
if you're interested the in you know
some magic jack tricks in a little bit

430
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:32,250
more information on that product

431
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,250
feel free to pick up the issue but if
you'd asked me a few years ago I would

432
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,080
have thought that that's the direction
we all would have been going

433
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,480
and I I would have thought that probably
that would be

434
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,850
on the most exciting thing today I don't
think so

435
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,429
because really what happened with Boyd
is what we use to do

436
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:53,429
on circuit-switched networks on the back
and

437
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:57,820
is now being done with port on the back
and but it's open transparent to you and

438
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,549
me as consumers

439
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:03,389
and the Boeing hasn't changed that's
gotten cheaper for carriers to provide

440
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:06,399
the service but this troubling you the
same or more

441
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,759
I it's kinda funny how that works on

442
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,870
so there's been growth and play it's
exciting it allows us to make better use

443
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,750
of the existing infrastructure we have
now

444
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,769
but we haven't really grown that
infrastructure in the last ten years

445
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:24,389
I at a real level beyond incremental

446
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:27,899
up this Ben broadband adoption at a
pretty wide scale

447
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:32,529
we're now seeing most the majority of
people who have internet access in the

448
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,380
US now have broadband

449
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,799
but its fairly small in terms of
majority

450
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,769
at something like sixty four percent the
last set of numbers I saw

451
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,380
this tremendously lags behind other
developed companies like

452
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,279
putney other developed countries I like
South Korea

453
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,480
I were pipetted option runs in the
nineties

454
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,450
and we've seen a lot of the you know
anybody who has an iPhone

455
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,490
knows that there's been a lot of new and
creative ways to bill for the exact same

456
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,269
service you've been enjoying

457
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:07,259
on and those creative ways always seem
to be

458
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,419
more expensive but we haven't seen a
tremendous amount

459
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,070
really oath at the at the network level

460
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,809
fundamentally a innovation and it really

461
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:25,639
sets 2001 to today

462
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:32,070
so um where we are though is this
interesting place where

463
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,730
it's possible now to communicate
virtually anywhere in the world

464
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,880
for little or nothing and that is a
Pandora's box

465
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,029
governments want to control online
speech in content

466
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,110
and you know it if you believe there's a
first amendment

467
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,210
that stole meaningful I'll I have a
bridge over they did over there to sell

468
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:53,860
you

469
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,059
the United States government is just as
guilty out governments that are more

470
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:01,250
overt in these efforts I it's just
behind the scenes

471
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,679
%uh for example %uh there is a strong
desire

472
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,580
in the cyber security community within
the United States federal government for

473
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,230
what they call a kill switch

474
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,519
where somebody in washington DC decides
to flip a switch

475
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,980
and we don't have internet access
anymore in the United States

476
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,480
and we've already built the San to

477
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,269
the telephone system with kaleah it's
possible

478
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,460
to kill telephone communications

479
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,039
it's not net not yet possible because
there isn't yet Cody and I

480
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,759
in the routers that are the core routers
have our Internet infrastructure to do

481
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,630
this

482
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,330
but one regulatory change and we have an
Internet kill switch

483
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,120
and the United States has that and
anytime they say that they need to stop

484
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,110
terrorism or political dissent that
could be terrorism

485
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,879
somebody in washington could anonymously
decide to you flip the kill switch

486
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:58,899
I even in the US %uh if you want to look
at a

487
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:02,480
where ry 0 unq right example when ghetto

488
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,059
some people might call conspiracy
theories YouTube is frequently censored

489
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:12,889
we have internet censorship today in the
US with the MCA takedown notices

490
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:16,279
I carriers want to slow innovation that
they can't control

491
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,610
by defeating net neutrality initiatives
and that this is a very important debate

492
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,279
that's happening right now

493
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:26,029
on should carriers be able %ah to

494
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:30,070
prioritize some traffic over others or
charge you more for certain types of

495
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,230
traffic than other types of traffic got
there by discouraging innovation

496
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,779
in a particular direction on many people
like me believe that

497
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:44,340
carrier should treat all traffic equally
I a common carrier should be just that

498
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,120
other people largely with companies like
Comcast and AT&T

499
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,139
a belief that they should be able to
control content

500
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:57,070
that reverses their networks and thereby

501
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,250
slow innovation that they can't figure
out a way to bill you extra for

502
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,460
on or control and innovation show called

503
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,620
I think is an American competitiveness
issue no I don't normally stand up on

504
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,840
stage in with the patriotic flag and I

505
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,679
and wear red white and blue bikini on
but

506
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,059
we do most of us live in the free world
and the United States

507
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,559
II yunus book from all over the web
obviously I would say them

508
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,830
the audience here as majority american
and

509
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,350
believe me South Korea isn't standing
still

510
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,559
Japan isn't standing still companies up
countries that we compete with

511
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,809
are not standing still and so if we
allow

512
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:43,039
american corporations to decide what

513
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,450
our policy is going to be as a nation by

514
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,159
and they're allowed to decide this in
the best interest if next quarter's

515
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:50,980
earnings

516
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,779
what happens is the long-term
investments that need to be made it may

517
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:00,659
not actually be made to keep America
competitive in this space so

518
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,600
I normally don't encourage many people
to become politically active

519
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,049
on I think that sometimes it does more
harm than good

520
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,340
but this is a mainstream issue and if
you feel

521
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,529
like this pandora's box should not be
closed

522
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:17,559
then please make your views known to

523
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:21,460
your representatives and senators

524
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,919
there are two exceptions to the lost
decade I

525
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:28,370
you know they're there were things that
happened on

526
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:33,230
that I think we're actually disruptive
and I think actually

527
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,250
do you open a lot of interesting
possibilities

528
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,870
%uh the first is social networking and
that actually now because he mails

529
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,129
become so useless in show put span

530
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:46,950
for many people it's become the default
way to interact with friends and

531
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,750
sometimes even family

532
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,879
and smartphones I really began to take
off

533
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:55,750
and so on let's have a little fun

534
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,429
up quick Showa hands who in this room
has

535
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:02,649
a smartphone and by that I define a
blackberry

536
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:06,190
an Android device or an iPhone

537
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:11,769
okay so I think there were maybe four
people that don't

538
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:16,460
on so leave your hands up

539
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,389
leave your hat k cuz I wanna see it
where where this goes so I and if we've

540
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:25,120
got anybody here with the camera like
I'd like to watch

541
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,100
yeah I'd like to see a video at this
later cuz it's hard for me to see from

542
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,009
the stage

543
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:36,009
on leave your hand up if you know
exactly how that phone works

544
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:39,509
okay I'm taking mine down cuz I town on

545
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:44,330
do you completely trust AT&T and Apple
if you have an iPhone

546
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,809
for no okay um

547
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:51,789
do you trust the vendor up every
application that you have installed on

548
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:52,429
your phone

549
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,600
such as Google for Facebook or myspace
or any those things

550
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,509
or it does anybody have I fight like
that thing where you press that button

551
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:02,490
on your iPhone farts

552
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,860
like do you trust that guy I ida okay so
it's so we've got

553
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:13,860
so we still got a couple hands up I do
you trust a caller ID is reliable

554
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:17,690
no does anybody do any SMS banking

555
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,909
do you trust us some ass

556
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:24,379
on okay is if anybody's hand is still up

557
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:29,629
would you trust me with your phone

558
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:33,779
okay so if you trust me with your phone
bring it up here all have a back to you

559
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:34,950
in a couple days

560
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:40,179
on but I think that that side you know
if it's gone the direction that you know

561
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:44,259
at least from the front that I can see
that's a pretty powerful exercise right

562
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:47,600
we have these computers in our pockets

563
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,840
and we don't know how they work and we
don't trust you

564
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,059
who wrote the software that runs on them
and we don't trust

565
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:59,080
the network but they're using

566
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,059
and we don't necessarily even trust

567
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,360
the calls that are coming and on that
they're really fun

568
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,399
who we think they are and we don't
necessarily need

569
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,299
you know trust that the SMS is that
we're getting a real

570
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,860
and so you know there's some really
interesting things here

571
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,230
on and you know I kinda like to to run
through

572
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,070
for a couple of scenarios on so

573
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:31,450
SMS is a really interesting I is a
really interesting piece

574
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:36,770
on so cool here uses text messages
frequently

575
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:41,730
and that would probably be the majority
if you I know for myself

576
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,449
i text me more than I talk now and

577
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:50,120
do you know where are your SMS messages
actually

578
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,020
go when you send them

579
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:59,300
either copies of them anywhere on is
their privacy policy Associated

580
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,200
and you know I'm asking these
rhetorically we can get into it you know

581
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,070
into this old and worn Q&A

582
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,420
but on my friend broker Chris here in
the audience and myself I

583
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,630
you know we actually went through an
exercise so a few months ago where we

584
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,360
try to figure out just

585
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,070
based on what SMS volumes are right that
a public

586
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,980
how much torture would take because
kinda one of the things that I do

587
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,850
professionally as I deal with
large-scale storage

588
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,000
how much torture would take to just
archive every SMS message that sent

589
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,610
you know to from or through the United
States on

590
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,250
a on any given day on and

591
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,410
you know it's a trivial amount of
storage particularly if you're using a

592
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,589
technology like deduplication

593
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:43,900
now I don't have any reason to believe
that things are being archived

594
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,950
when they shouldn't be here that anybody
in particular skewing at

595
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,419
um but do you know that that's not the
case

596
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,000
and have you ever said anything an SMS
that maybe you wouldn't want to

597
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,160
I you know posted to

598
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,270
a Twitter feed somewhere on and so you
know this is a

599
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,900
this is an interesting question and I i
really just you know that I'm

600
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,160
bringing this up not to make you
especially paranoid although I probably

601
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,790
should make you paranoid by pointing out
that

602
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,808
on some love the surveillance
infrastructure that's been implemented

603
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:17,900
that does allow

604
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,349
with the government to track your GPS
coordinates at any given time even if

605
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:22,569
your phones off

606
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:26,430
and some phones I'll are able to turn
themselves on and listen to what's going

607
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,868
on around them

608
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:31,210
when that the appropriate commander said
to them um

609
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,559
and you know I love this the government
or somebody

610
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,690
using these commands you shouldn't okay

611
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:42,440
well would have today would have to do
but you know the technologies both tend

612
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,180
to

613
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,569
I to your device and there aren't people
really looking at these things and

614
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:49,140
seeing whether they're secure

615
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,319
and seeing whether they're really being
use the way that they should

616
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:56,029
and there doesn't seem to be a lot of
accountability for things like National

617
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,490
Security Letter so

618
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,040
which can activate all this technology
so

619
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,839
in the name of stopping terrorism world
governments have created a massive

620
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,700
surveillance infrastructure the likes of
which have never really existed in human

621
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,730
history

622
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,319
but in the neighbor be more popular you
have probably given even more personal

623
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:17,300
information to Facebook and Google

624
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,970
and your privacy really is for sale when
you use social networks

625
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,130
you were not a customer a Facebook
Google or Twitter

626
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,349
you are the product that they sell to
their customers

627
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:32,760
and if you feel like deleting your
account after all this while don't

628
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,180
bother because they still on your data

629
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,149
have any have you actually read the
Privacy Policy for Facebook if your

630
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,319
Facebook user

631
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:44,859
K which one is that is what I would ask

632
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:49,808
because it changes every other week
roughly

633
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,720
and this is part of the danger with
trusting privacy policies to actually

634
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,540
secure privacy when the interests of
services you use

635
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:04,040
are opposed to your own address and when
the operator of the service can change

636
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,640
the privacy policy anytime they like

637
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,140
affectively all your base are belong to
them

638
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,629
for so

639
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,650
your freedom really is at risk and this
actually is gotten fairly serious you

640
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,270
know what if this guy on the screen
where one if your Facebook friends and

641
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,009
decided that you were

642
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,700
probably a terrorist on that could end
very badly for you

643
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,390
it ended very badly for somebody
recently um

644
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:37,270
now I don't know whether the guy that's
alleged to be a terrorist is a result

645
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,710
I don't have that information I'm all I
can look at is well

646
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,050
there were some social networks involved
there were some blacks privacy policies

647
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,990
in place there were some trust
relationships

648
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,490
that maybe shouldn't have been there
that were there and what that resulted

649
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,750
in as somebody sitting in jail right now

650
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,569
and you know whether or not it belongs
there on

651
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:02,329
I'm not Revie a qualified to comment but

652
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:07,200
what I can comment on the is that if all
of these tools weren't there

653
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,550
and if they weren't being widely trusted
I in ways that shouldn't be

654
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,910
then maybe that sequence of events would
have fun not happen the same way that it

655
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,470
dead

656
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,640
so here's a call to action and

657
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,900
a really why we're all here

658
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,339
is this is a socially that we're coming
together as hackers to bounce ideas off

659
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:29,328
each other

660
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,290
we're coming together to learn things
that we don't already know and share

661
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,910
things that we do now

662
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,930
out that other people might be able to
drive even further

663
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,109
where more connected than we've ever
been before and were less connected

664
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:45,869
than we've ever been before online
communities are useful

665
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:49,500
but there really no substitute for
direct human interaction so much more

666
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,650
happens when we come together in
communities like 2600 meetings

667
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:58,980
I like Metrix create space in Seattle
I'll or like conferences such as hope

668
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,280
or deaf con I'm with the rapid advances
in smartphones and social media

669
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,099
we're inventing new technologies said a
faster pace than any time since the

670
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,900
1990s and this is

671
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,339
really gotten out of hand I mean we have
a different you know

672
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:17,770
iPhone application every hour
practically I Android applications are

673
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,440
ramping up for going to be having a new
smartphone platform watch that I expect

674
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,670
what a popular

675
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,230
on these technologies though I think

676
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,540
are largely not secure and they put way
too much personal data and the hands of

677
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,849
corporations

678
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:35,290
iight you guys need to be taking this
stuff apart

679
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,390
you guys need to be showing the wear bet
to out you know did you know when your

680
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,359
phone that your GPS coordinates are
readily available and could be misused

681
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,460
people taking this stuff apart is what's
going to make the technology better

682
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,900
and the last pieces really think through

683
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,319
the social implications when you're
either inventing or consuming new

684
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,619
technologies

685
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:01,680
on there could be additional collections
that

686
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,930
in the focus to get a product out the
door you don't necessarily consider

687
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,430
and we r innovating at a very rapid pace

688
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:14,379
%uh so I understand that it's necessary
sometimes to be first to market with the

689
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,260
product

690
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,990
but when you do that if you haven't
thought through

691
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,599
what the implications really could be
you know two or three degrees out

692
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,220
then possibly it could come back to bat
to bite you

693
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,480
and so with that on

694
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,530
open up the floor to questions I just
want peace %ah

695
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,569
I live in Beijing so any discussion 05
China

696
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:42,480
or China the Chinese government policy
in any of these areas

697
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,970
unfortunately I can't address but
anything else

698
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:50,270
particularly the US or anywhere else in
the world is fair game so I

699
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:57,270
love to hear your any questions you may
have

700
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:04,630
and thank you for being such an awesome
audience

701
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,720
their side yes so there was some
microphones in the I always

702
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,930
a surf you line up at the mic some I'm
sure the

703
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:24,259
this Heather sum up in the front as well

704
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,330
I guess I can't really see you know at
this point lights in my eyes so

705
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:33,299
maybe if the people with the hope this
on security going out there a cover

706
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,470
grass is this on its on I got an
infrastructure question yeah what's up

707
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:44,190
how much fiber is still dark how much
fiber is still dark that's a great

708
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,320
question so

709
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,060
on fiber optic cable when it gets laid

710
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,880
basically has insight ovett a number of
strands

711
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,740
and so in order if laying fiber is in a
very interesting thing to do

712
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,210
I mean you take attraction you drop the
cable and it nets you know a few dollars

713
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:01,960
a foot

714
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,280
on what's the hard part

715
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,340
is getting enough fiber what we call let
in the telecommunications industry and

716
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,370
that's where you have

717
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,680
of a bunch of equipment that's very
expensive on

718
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,140
that all-state 01 fiber and it uses side
a technology

719
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,460
the most popular one currently is called
DWDM so typically what will happen

720
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,990
is a carrier it that's laying a
fiber-optic network

721
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:30,810
they walk necessary you know this
technology can be changed out

722
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,700
relatively easily with wind carts on so
as we come up

723
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,220
with new and better ways to transfer
data faster I you just pull out

724
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,810
you know every couple 05 miles out one
car to drop another n

725
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,200
and you know this can be done in a
return that way but

726
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,330
there's so much fiber in the ground that
isn't let

727
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,799
because typically what your only doing
is lighting one strand in the cable

728
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,370
and you may be leasing others trance
other companies

729
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,690
so there's a tremendous amount of dark
fiber I

730
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,820
dark fiber though is in a very useful
thing

731
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,680
I you can't do much with that you can
run some you know we've got technology

732
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,890
we can run some metropolitan area
networks at relatively low speed without

733
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:12,819
lighting it up

734
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:17,000
but until we come up with a way to use
dark fiber

735
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,970
across so long distances without this
very expensive equipment

736
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:27,430
I doesn't do a whole lot a good EDS my
question your question

737
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,580
so the question is so for every mile
fiber that we have

738
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,930
and for you know it's it's like
basically you gotta hate you

739
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,480
you need to know for each on each truck

740
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,170
how many carriers are using that fiber
strand

741
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:47,360
so some companies don't actually lease
any fiber

742
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,330
to other companies some do I it's our
proprietary information internally

743
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:55,470
so all I can do is conjecture but

744
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,160
I can say on average cable I'd be
surprised if more than 10 percent

745
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,799
evidence let

746
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,020
the into the nineties it was something
like ninety seven percent was dark and

747
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,930
all that is potential

748
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:11,109
infrastructure that's band with waiting
to be used

749
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,570
it isn't being used well its potential
infrastructure to keep in mind so you

750
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,080
if you light up fiber you can change out
that technology with technology with

751
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,420
newer technology

752
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,530
that is able to move data at faster
rates

753
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:29,240
along the same fiber strand and so part
if the incremental innovation that's

754
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,970
happened between 2000

755
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,680
and now is that we've gone to you faster
speeds

756
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,839
on the existing fiber that we already
have so

757
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,280
I don't see that incremental approach
changing

758
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,930
we're not gonna see each I norm St play
mezzo lighting up dark fiber I mean it

759
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,910
cost billions of dollars to do that

760
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:53,000
so what I'm guessing war and we already
have more bandwidth

761
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,050
on the backbones then we really can use
I mean the problem

762
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,380
the pan with problem that we're having
currently is how do you get that last

763
00:45:59,380 --> 00:45:59,990
mile

764
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:06,990
not spend the problem for the last
fifteen years I can say that I run a 2.4

765
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,710
well ep at work on

766
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,820
I can't get into too much detail of what
I do at work but I will

767
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,930
I can say that we have %uh some backbone
networks at work that are

768
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:23,149
grossly underutilized and it's largely
on

769
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,430
it's not that we captured a day at other
carriers sets that they can accept that

770
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,200
quickly enough

771
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,000
this question is mostly semantic but I
think it's kinda important when

772
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,120
discussing these issues

773
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,270
here for two arm company same DMCA
takedown notices to YouTube is

774
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,360
censorship

775
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,540
those one company telling another
company threatening them with legal

776
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,360
action constitute censorship for

777
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,650
would you say something I've someone
argued something that comes Pacific from

778
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,880
the government

779
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,990
that I believe that it's censorship

780
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:57,630
on so you have content and that content
is taken down

781
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,080
and it's taken down through a legal
mechanism so

782
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,529
that to me is censorship I you can
reasonable people can disagree on this

783
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,110
right

784
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:13,110
on I happen this is my personal belief

785
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,820
was wondering what your thoughts were on
Moxie my own spikes work with our

786
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,220
Android applications for secure text
messaging and phone calls I think it's

787
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,400
our red phone and Dom

788
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,080
tech secure I can't forget the name the
other one I haven't seen it but I'd love

789
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,700
to %uh send it to me

790
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,650
sure ever question on

791
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,210
sorta will what are your thoughts on the
thank you for that

792
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,540
locally it's called the truth in caller
ID bill

793
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,700
for that year the caller ID will yet
what do you think about that we would

794
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,400
hear thought so what would be the

795
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,000
benefits are disadvantages have
requiring that caller ID is

796
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,810
legitimized somehow from its source so
let's talk about this little bit because

797
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,600
that's a really interesting topic

798
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,420
arm you know living in China right now
when I call somebody from my Chinese

799
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,060
cell phone

800
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,310
usually the number comes up unavailable
and apparently the majority of people

801
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,410
that I call

802
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,240
on in this may or may not be up you know
representative

803
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,130
people overall it's just you know my
crib befriends believe that when the

804
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,330
phone says unavailable and there is a
number that pops up

805
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,970
it's a monster calling and they don't
answer

806
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:25,430
arm so E you know caller ID is one of
those things that is an especially

807
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,509
reliable anyway we haven't even really
figured out

808
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,760
you know how to make it work across
international boundaries yet in some

809
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,830
cases even

810
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,690
you know within the United States it
doesn't it doesn't work very well

811
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,710
on so

812
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,120
a true thing caller ID bill I'll me
that's

813
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,220
thats it's going to be difficult to
enforce because

814
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,820
what has to be proven I in the
legislation as it's written now is that

815
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,950
you intentionally

816
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:56,460
obfuscated your caller ID somehow I and
that you did it with malicious site

817
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,410
intent

818
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:03,160
on so what are the other interesting
problems with Caller ID is that

819
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,589
if you pass a law in the United States
will the phone system is global

820
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:10,240
and so what I would expect to happen is
that the malicious people that are doing

821
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,110
malicious caller ID things would just
move outside the boundaries the United

822
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,000
States

823
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,100
and then what do you do to enforce the
law against somebody who isn't

824
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,790
particularly known because

825
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,460
with the world of weight it's very
interesting I mean it becomes very

826
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,310
difficult to see were calls are actually
coming from and who sending them

827
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,029
on we've opened with what the genie out
of the bottle on ss7

828
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:38,150
and you know when some sleazy VoIP
provider in Romania has the same access

829
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,890
to

830
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,180
the ss7 network says for rice n

831
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:47,370
then you really aren't safe anywhere us
so don't trust caller ID is the bottom

832
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,640
line and if there's a lot that gets
passed

833
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:56,080
you too early no laws are always
effective when they get past rated

834
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,200
super presentation you talked about

835
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,430
government monitoring phone calls but
there's cell phone spyware

836
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,000
is a very scary thing and you can be
downloaded

837
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,560
if on your phone I can track your
movements I can watch

838
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,170
on this into your phone calls I can turn
on the

839
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,540
microphone to listen to room twelve
telephone calls it's not getting the

840
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,770
media attention I think it probably
deserves

841
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:25,500
we know it sure would if Sarah Palin
download its cell phone spyware or

842
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,770
better yet if Bristol Palin dead then

843
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:32,670
ito I think Fox News would be all over
that so

844
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,640
the and that's really part of the call
to action right we have these devices

845
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,000
that have

846
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,030
ridiculous security for us in anybody
who

847
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,340
really knows anything in this area is
well aware of this

848
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,410
on their APIs that leave I'll

849
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:50,980
large swaths if things that should never
be open open

850
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,380
and Brady what we're not seeing is

851
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,060
these platforms spell you know there's
an attack surface this is because coat

852
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,670
see

853
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,900
and nobody's really doing much with it

854
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,700
please somebody attack Sarah Palin
averse to pay on let's let's not

855
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,360
call for attacks on specific people army

856
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,090
I don't wanna be whole topic here in
handcuffs but to

857
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,140
oh what a what I would say is that on

858
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:22,770
the re vs as hackers as freaks as
security people we need to be looking at

859
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,070
this stuff and we need to be talking
about this stuff with people that don't

860
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,830
know as much as we do

861
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:32,360
I arm in my phone I have a setting that

862
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,470
says I'm like don't send identification

863
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:39,290
and when I call somebody it'll show up
as unknown number

864
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:43,230
is actually something in my phone that's
preventing my phone number from being

865
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,310
sent out where is that

866
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,860
done by the provider so what you have is
a GSM phone presumably

867
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,590
yes and what you're doing is you're
setting a flag it's it's itchy GSM

868
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,760
feature where you can

869
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,250
instruct the GSM network not to send
your caller ID

870
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:04,000
that can be honored or not I and it
isn't controlled by your phone it's your

871
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,990
phones just the interface through which
you can select that

872
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,340
I if you have a on if you have a CDMA
phone

873
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,890
if you dial star 67 you can selectively
block your caller ID

874
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,120
where you can have your carrier block it
for every call okay

875
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,700
thank you there

876
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,060
going back to infrastructure and
community for a second

877
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,680
I'm curious your thoughts on what we can
do as people

878
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,390
liberate ourselves from these
corporations actually build their own

879
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,200
phone networks to the wireless or
otherwise

880
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,970
so the scope of my talk really is a call
to action

881
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,510
but it isn't a call to any specific
action and

882
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:47,870
I have to leave things open ended on I
don't know how all this is going to

883
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:48,839
shake out

884
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,150
I don't know three years from now how
this is going to work

885
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:56,490
and really that's up to all of you and
it's up to you if you're passionate

886
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,750
about this issue

887
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,530
to look at a way where you can leverage
where you're awesome and what you know

888
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,280
and how you can inspire other people

889
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,140
and so really all I can do is encourage
you

890
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:13,190
said take that forgive you that
understands that part if this issue that

891
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,840
other people don't

892
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,380
and shed light on it make it public

893
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,420
talk to other people you're here at hope
that's what this is for

894
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,520
I have time for one more question and
then we have to go

895
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,350
when you think routers will be a thing
of the past

896
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,460
and the internet will be wide open cDNA

897
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,480
or something like that with just digital
signal processors everywhere

898
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,490
as long as we need to push back its and
as long as we're still using TCP IP we

899
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,930
will need writers

900
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:47,180
so I don't think that's going away
anytime soon on

901
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,720
you know what the transport is before we
get to their and I think

902
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,830
I don't think Chrissy Wireless is a as
what we're using for our trucks I mean

903
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,549
that's gonna be class on the ground and
its

904
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,150
its gonna stay that way at least for the
foreseeable future I think

905
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,100
on I you know that's that's an
interesting question

906
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,450
but until we get away from that

907
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:10,510
in using TCP IP I don't see that
happening

908
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:13,810
okay well I you been a fantastic
audience thank you so much
