86
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,450

and of course I went on a hotel room

87
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,280
with a bunch of my friends we ended up
in this

88
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,810
really weird oddly size shape truman

89
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,570
that was really big and that had like an
extra couple love rooms attached to

90
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,140
which were

91
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,570
just totally empty which he thought was
kind word in this course being college

92
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,260
students

93
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,460
whatever first times in a hotel room
this big without we have to throw an

94
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,590
awesome party

95
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,340
see found all over France from Def Con
we found all her friends

96
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,440
that we need from Meijer seen it really
doesn't everybody bought in on a

97
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,480
gigantic cash have liquor

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,580
at about maybe 8:30 we went around and
we

99
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,000
literally drain the ice outta all the
machines in the hotel

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,180
and filled up the bathtub just
completely for Vice

101
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,140
and then put all the beer all the liquor
everything in there and we actually for

102
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,930
some reason had this crazy Australian
dude who is

103
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,640
and only I don't know what his deal was
views on speaker something but his whole

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,289
function

105
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,750
for like 4-5 hours that night was to
continue reading all the ice machines on

106
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,010
the rested for keeping our bathtub full
of ice

107
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,230
now we wouldn't have had a rocking party

108
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,960
had still not brought his crew from the
talk

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,860
into the room people who just want to
talk to a more and more more and we were

110
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,510
partying

111
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,360
I think until seven or eight AM I think
actually hotel housekeeping

112
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,840
was the one that stopped our party
because there's nobody else on our floor

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,169
to clean the rooms out so that that's
that made my personal experience was

114
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,349
how many guys have collected a story
something like that at this conference

115
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,260
her previous actors and planners
conference

116
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,280
relief that that's its

117
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,470

118
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,560

is be a little more interactive and

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,410
and maybe a little more responsive to
what the group wants in the way of

128
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,419

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,990
only time

161
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,000
I will announce that thank you

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,910
on but there's a difference between me
and ross perot 1 I'm not a little shit

163
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,360
and to on you've got to get me in all
fifty ballots and no I won't come if you

164
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,820
don't

165
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,650
for alright let saddam

166
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,860
it's gonna take it from the top as best
I can tell

167
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,920
the United States

168
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,079
is run by Goldman Sachs on behalf of the
rock dropped

169
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,760
on in all of our income taxes are
basically channeled

170
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,800
in a manner that disconnects us from the
way in which the money is spent

171
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,460
and in essence congress has been bought

172
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,530
but actually in fairness to the people
buying congress it's congress that

173
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,140
shakes them down not the other way
around the standard rate

174
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,439
on the hill is five percent any project
any earmarked to congress delivers

175
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,340
they expect five percent into the pack
up the member that sponsored

176
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,660
the program at the contractor whatever
okay so we not only have a corrupt

177
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,410
congress

178
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,870
but under Dick Cheney we have a congress
that

179
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,240
consists of foot soldiers they have
abdicated their article one

180
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,610
responsibility

181
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,140
which is why I personally recommend to
you that you

182
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,210
vote out every single mother fucker now
in congress

183
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:22,210
a

184
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,860
it's called the Constitution it starts
with a C all right now

185
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,310
the bad news is congress

186
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,690
and the governors have show host the
electoral process to make it impossible

187
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,870
for independents libertarians and others
to get on the ballot and I strongly

188
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,910
recommend you a book by one of ralph
nader senior rates called the grand

189
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,760
illusion

190
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,010
on understanding the two-party tyranny

191
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,080
and even here in washington there

192
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,740
I mean here in New York there have been
a couple breakouts Peter Peterson a very

193
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,570
wealthy man

194
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,740
%uh wrote a book called running on empty

195
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,100
how the two parties are betraying
American what we can do about it well

196
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,330
unfortunately nobody in New York and
nobody in washington actually wants to

197
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,570
do anything about it

198
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,900
and one other things you have to
understand is that people like

199
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,610
Ron Paul however much we might love him
a part of what's called the controlled

200
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,440
opposition

201
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,170
there there is window dressing O'bama

202
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,770
was a roadshow okay

203
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,040
Obama broke his promise to make a he
took

204
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,630
money and he has an account it for $300
million to the $750 million he spent

205
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,660
on buckminster fuller

206
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,420
said the white house's fear and he's
absolutely right

207
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,910
on and I did not realize this until I

208
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,510
myself found that my misplaced
confidence in Obama

209
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:59,210
a was utterly destroyed by rama manuel
on one hand the David Axelrod on the

210
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,410
other this guy is surrounded by a public
mister a pollster

211
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,900
okay and his decisions

212
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,210
are articulated in a manner that is
every day

213
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:15,350
idiocy a a there is nothing sensible
about Barack Obama for

214
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:22,350
there's nothing sensible about Michelle
Obama it troubles me that she tells

215
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,080
everyone to go on vacation in louisiana
then heads for me

216
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,670
for these people

217
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,330
are hypocrites but so are the Bush
family so the clinton family

218
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,140
these people are all part of a mafia
that began with macarthur's capturing

219
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,430
the Japanese cold

220
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,210
a story told in a wonderful book by
Peggy and

221
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,500
sterling city grapes cold cold warriors
there's been an illicit

222
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,950
gold fund run out of Treasury since the
end of World War two and it was used

223
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,530
issue gold certificates

224
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:00,410
and two whenever so that was gonna come
with their

225
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,610
ok good okay things I need to mainline
some caffeine here

226
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,000
I was gonna do it you too it for that
stuff but then they told me it tasted

227
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,910
like shit so

228
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,370
again but drink it anyway

229
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,370
up

230
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,370
alright so the bottom line here is I
think we're at a point in American

231
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,460
history

232
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,820
where we literally need a general strike

233
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,920
on and by general strike I mean a
nonviolent stay home one day

234
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,680
on and unfortunately I have tried very
hard for the last

235
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,340
eight years to get people like Ron Paul

236
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,260
and ralph nader and it may be that I
don't need this if you guys decide you

237
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,250
want to take a tour the internet which
will try it but I can

238
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,990
talk from memory on I've tried to get
ron Paul and ralph nader and Cynthia

239
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,090
McKinney and Jackie say let

240
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,570
to play nicely together and they won't
do it

241
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,280
they absolutely will not come together
and do the one simple thing

242
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,640
that would basically nail congress which
is demand electoral reform in time for

243
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,530
2010

244
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,650
this is not rocket science electoral
reform

245
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,560
there at least four things we can do for
4 2010 including instant runoff

246
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,190
voting on a holiday so the poor don't
have to juggle bus schedules

247
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,480
and of course ballot access for anybody

248
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,790
that can come up with the minimum
signatures this is our country

249
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,000
and we I have allowed it to be carpet
backed

250
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,990
up out of our possession so electoral
reform is the one thing

251
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,400
that Ron Paul and ralph nader and
Cynthia McKinney and Jackie sale it and

252
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,290
Mike Bloomberg if he ever decides to get
serious about running for president

253
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,900
on should all be talking about electoral
reform

254
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,190
it's very very simple Barack Obama

255
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,700
was elected by 30 percent the eligible
voters

256
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,100
I think it was 54.6 her 56.4

257
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,260
the eligible voters that voted and

258
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,339
if John McCain had not been surrounded
by bush's whose job it was to sabotage

259
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,109
his campaign

260
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,110
he would have come out and sided with
the house republicans who were

261
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,949
demonstrating a modicum of common sense

262
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,300
and said over my dead fucking body will
you bail out Wall Street

263
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,889
I would have frozen evictions and
foreclosures and I would have ensured

264
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,980
every american from the bottom up

265
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,460
and I guarantee you it would have cost
10th

266
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,630
above what Wall Street has cost us so
that alone

267
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,790
is treason against the american public

268
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,590
by both parties and that alone

269
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,100
demands that we eliminate the Republican
and Democratic parties from the face

270
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,260
this electoral

271
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,530
process I'm on my best behavior the
medications really are working

272
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:05,639
owned I so starting at the very top
we've lost control in the United States

273
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,730
we've lost control

274
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,840
the Treasury the government is out of
control

275
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,560
and we're at a point now where stuff has
to be done

276
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,840
for

277
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,939
do you want to try and get video were

278
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,580
that's my power cord this is a really
shitty connection that won't screw in

279
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,710
for you want to get rid of it okay I
guess I'm not using my computer

280
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,710
on

281
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,260
I i really was hoping to give you guys
some

282
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,799
some interesting sites and stuff but you
can help me

283
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm interested in being helped I need
help i need a lot of help

284
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,809
I alright so

285
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,210
so basically what what we have in and
it's really remarkable

286
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,400
the Huxley really got it right in 1984
and Animal Farm

287
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,190
on we've become a cheating society

288
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,549
and by the way I speaking book titles

289
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:22,059
okay so when I kinda have a phrase like
cheating society it's really a book I've

290
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:22,750
reviewed

291
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,870
on Amazon and if you go to Phi Beta iota
done net

292
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,320
and I simply pick that after my free
Obama done net site

293
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,360
didn't arouse a lot of excitement on 58
iota done that is where have all my book

294
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,080
reviews and I have pointers to the
30,000 pages in OSX dotnet

295
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,780
and to the start of the earth
intelligence network which is in there

296

IRS a 501 c3 we can give you a letter if
you wanna donate things in

297
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,610

books back there

T-shirt he spent a year researching that

300
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,470
t shirt I have never seen anyone do a
better job

301
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,410
deep research that he has done on the
true cost to that t sure how many people

302
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,490
are familiar with the true cost me

303
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,590
holy share you're a bunch of dumb fucks

304

spy improv and turned it into like 50
really cool audio sound bites with text

312
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,179
captions

313
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,970
I have some books to give you on I'm
really

314
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,059
grateful and humbled by the fact that
some would spend that much time making

315
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,299
sense out of

316
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:07,629
four hours serve stream of consciousness
talking on

317
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,370
we

318
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,309
half kind if been put into a position
where

319
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,970
on we have no se

320
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,000
I mean we the reason I titled my brief
your

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,140
two days ago when they don't packing
humanity is we've taken the humanity of

322
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,610
politics we've taken the humanity at a
business

323
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,240
we've taken the humanity and everything
and what's really cool is that the one

324
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,000
inexhaustible resource we have on the
face of this planet is the human brain

325
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,059
and the human brain can create

326
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:45,918
infinite wealth just to digress back for
a second the cell phones were finding

327
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,760
out that cell phones are killing bees
which is going to wipe out our

328
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,080
agriculture pollination cycle okay

329
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,449
and I'm serious this is the one
intelligent think CNN is done in the

330
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,490
last twenty years

331
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,730
are okay

332
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,169
it's a start fake here

333
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,540
a.m. and i won a fake Nick to

334
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,250
are he he he's the head of volunteers

335
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:19,250
and I didn't realize he was gonna hold
it over my head for the rest of my life

336
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,700
but the we did in fact meet over bath
tub

337
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,270
and in Nick

338
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,340
let me have his bed for two hours man I
didn't use the sheets

339
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,000
%uh cell make your bed still claim and
thank you for giving me a nap

340
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,030
really that just showed some

341
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:46,809
class there thank you on so I think we
really have to take care of to get a

342
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:50,379
grip on yourself and the kinda make this
plea about humanity in its potential

343
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,690
CK Prahalad who should get the Nobel
Prize I mean here

344
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,510
but two or three nobel prizes given
recent leader that are really good one

345
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,419
was to be honest

346
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,370
on Press election get another one I
won't mention the two idiots

347
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,580
gotta nobel prize is one of them for 10
days in office

348
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:13,250
on I mean these people are shameless
they're prostituting themself

349
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,280
buckminster fuller wrote a book titled
integrity

350
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,879
integrity is about more than honor its
about feedback loops

351
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,030
it's about data without errors it's
about I subtitled my new book

352
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,020
clarity diversity integrity
sustainability

353
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:35,080
show coming back to CK Prahalad he's
pointed out that capitalism is based

354
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,550
on the one billion riches aggregate
income is one trillion

355
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,690
you know come back to true cost in the
second because I am shocked

356
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,270
that a group of this intelligence
doesn't really have a grip on

357
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,020
on the four to five billion

358
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,590
poor people have an aggregate annual
income of

359
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,800
four trillion so if capitalism

360
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,390
based on $1 billion rich $1 trillion
market they're buying sub-zero fridge is

361
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,790
every two years

362
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,960
and African refrigerator cost two
dollars and consists of the cement pond

363
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
with a long neck and ear cap another
cement pot with a long neck in Newbury

364
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,679
this in the ground and it keeps me fresh
for five days

365
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,390
and Genesis latest book on social
business is certainly worth reading

366
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,720
the bottom line here is we have been so
busy screwing the bottom of the pyramid

367
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,419
we haven't

368
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,520
realize that they're the only thing
that's gonna save us

369
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,100
and so that's why the earth intelligence
network came together conceptualize the

370
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,800
idea

371
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,700
both educating the poor oneself call at
the time

372
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,290
and Nokia now has a cell phone that
operates on ambien energy

373
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,610
so it doesn't need an electrical
recharges night this is very cool

374
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,700
on the chinese have cell towers that are
solar and wind-powered

375
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,380
and at Burning Man which I'm hoping to
go to my first one

376
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,470
I'll be in the village that's being set
up by doctor doctor

377
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,960
Dave Warner wheaties and mercifully

378
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,809
worse Leslie he's an md/phd

379
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:07,870
neurosurgeon was some real psychological
problems

380
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,120
on and and I love them for that on he's
really one of the coolest guys I know he

381
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,440
and Eric Rasmussen created strong angel
he created choose a which is an analytic

382
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,419
tool kit on a flash drive and I want to
improve on that

383
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,290
because where I'm going with the world
brain is we should all be part of the

384
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,139
world brain and we should all have a

385
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,700
a structured method for for information
sharing and sensemaking

386
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,929
on so we really have got to get a grip

387
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:38,730
on and now to just talk about true cost
for a minute and then I'll

388
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,580
let you guys intervene on me a second
want them all to JFK

389
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,330
arm again when the gas costs 350 four
dollars whatever

390
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,658
that's what you pay at the pump prior to
BP

391
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:55,990
exxon and these others were
externalizing

392
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,710
twelve dollars a gallon and costs

393
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,120
so jay-z when he did this t-shirt in an
absolutely

394
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,500
totally blown away with admiration he
did the true cost that

395
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,559
white cotton t-shirt in terms of water
the number of gallons it took to grow

396
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,629
the cotton

397
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,020
washer chip so forth of fuel

398
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,418
the fuel that was used up by the
machines harvesting the con

399
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,480
and so forth the fuel used to transport
it child labor at fifty cents

400
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,820
day on that's what's true cost okay so
true cost actually gets down i mean

401
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,559
it takes more water to make the plastic
that the scope comes in

402
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,460
then the the water contained in the coke
in fact

403
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,950
coca-cola stealing water worldwide

404
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,090
Minnesota just threw them out because
they want to become an addict down into

405
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,580
the act for export Minnesota's water

406
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,290
as coke a new hampshire's well thank you
and we are part of a collective and I

407
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,158
really wanted

408
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,850
to encourage on interventions from the
audience

409
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,899
a a if their sensible shout them out

410
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:06,399
%uh so that we can get kind of a
collective back and forth going here I'd

411
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:09,220
like to see this work

412
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,100
I shall I go to JFK

413
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,040
alright up a little bit a BP first up BP
by the way was responsible for the Exxon

414
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,520
Valdez

415
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,310
on and one of the interesting things
about BP is they've perfected the art of

416
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,678
making promises they don't keep

417
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,940
on essentially the US government which
is trying to micromanage stuff and we

418
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,149
can get in the complexity theory and all
that other good stuff

419
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:40,000
and I can also view some mighty stuff
some security stuff some cyber scams

420
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,220
stuff

421
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,070
home logical people in the federal
government

422
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,040
understand the risks associated with
undersea drilling and so forth and BP

423
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,770
and others when they're given these
leases are required to commit

424
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,060
to having 24/7 emergency response teams
within four hours have any possible

425
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,370
breach

426
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,840
fully trained crews ready to go up bowls
and everything ready to contain this

427
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,399
within

428
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,990
you know 12 hours whatever and what they
do is they

429
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,580
they set all that up and then they let
atrophy to the point that it doesn't

430
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,250
exist anymore

431
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,760
okay so essentially BP violated the
public trust and of course BP is

432
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,610
operating under public charter

433
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,200
what's at cushion for the wall

434
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,360
want it one

435
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,250
I'm sorry I'm sorry just poured a spirit
stick is what he said

436
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:43,019
if I hope she likes beer up

437
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,109
alright so JFK

438
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:50,199
up my take on JFK based on reading a
number of books including a book that's

439
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,179
very popular 5800 to the review of JFK
who killed a man why it matters:

440
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:01,379
I believe that JFK was killed but cuban
exiles trained and equipped by

441
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:06,200
the Central Intelligence Agency and that
at least select members at the Sentul

442
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,009
intelligence agency were actively
complicity to include individuals in the

443
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:14,700
office of technical services they
created fraudulent Secret Service

444
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,559
credentials

445
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,509
that allowed the perpetrators to escape
and I believe that will come out

446
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,950
in time just as it is now coming out
that

447
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,009
the we all knew the Gulf of Tonkin

448
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,200
was a fraud on and it's now coming out

449
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,700
that the Gulf of Tonkin was seriously
debated within government

450
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,369
enormous doubts existed in secrecy was
used to deceive Congress and the public

451
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:47,369
now in the case of iraq dick cheney
didn't bother with secrecy heat issues

452
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,979
935 documented lives

453
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:55,529
and we let them get away with it okay I
highly recommend a book called the

454
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,090
weapons of mass destruction don't be
fooled by the cartoon cover it's a

455
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,210
superb book

456
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:06,989
on so JFK Martin Luther K an active
state I believe the FBI ordered him

457
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:09,979
killed in the army helped if they
provided the sniper

458
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:15,729
on so we've got some pretty bad things
not only to ourselves yes sir

459
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:20,039
room more than one

460
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,899
on small tit not test at all us what was
a patsy at least one

461
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:28,700
I mean but yet to and one and I think he
was killed from in front

462
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,729
okay on and so all this stuff is
starting to come out what's actually

463
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:37,609
fascinating to me is the way in which
the public sit silently and allows

464
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,059
whitewashes to happen

465
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:42,549
me talking about the 9/11 whitewash that
the National

466
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,149
technical security whatever the hell
they are won't release the findings from

467
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:50,210
the World Trade Center controlled
demolitions

468
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,919
by Larry Silverstein who had Rudy
Giuliani who had the dump trucks lined

469
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,419
up the day before the accident

470
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:00,070
books and they all had GPS

471
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,629
so that they can track where the rubble
went and the firefighters rioted they

472
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,159
call them school but don't call you on
it because he was coping and don't think

473
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,139
and we have

474
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:13,210
and we now have courtesy of German
hackers we now have all of the

475
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:19,779
cell phone calls on 9/11 and all the
reports of bombs from 9-11 and that also

476
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:23,049
came out across the radio waves on the
TV channel said

477
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,149
there were a number of news broadcasters
that basically announce things before

478
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:27,840
they happen

479
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,129
because they were being fed news feed
when you get down to doing a serious

480
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:33,639
time analysis

481
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:38,519
%uh 911 I think you will find that it
was not only allowed to happen

482
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,509
but that dick cheney three months in
advance schedule that counterterrorism

483
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:45,730
accident so he could control our
response

484
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,470
and ensure that we did not interfere
with their this is serious possibility

485
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,669
that there were unmanned aerial vehicle
controls on those two jets

486
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:58,320
and the WTC 7 was the final control

487
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,210
point and it was brought down by
controlled demolitions

488
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,759
on them by the way was a hit by anything

489
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,950
okay on so I am very concerned and I
like to try to keep my credibility with

490
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,339
with those who view their

491
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:18,749
did think conspiracy theory is evil on
by saying that we don't know for certain

492
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:22,980
but I absolutely agree with Mike Rupert
and others there is more than enough

493
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,690
information out there to tell us number
one it was whitewashed and not properly

494
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,839
investigated

495
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,720
and number two Larry Silverstein rudy
guiliani and Dick Cheney should be

496
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,720
indicted and I would like to see Dick
Cheney Hunger Force guys ask

497
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,099
what's there I actually I'm told he
likes leather

498
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:55,099
a a very prominent bisexual who is a
really great party you're told me this

499
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,849
personally and I think he was speaking
from

500
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:04,458
I

501
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:09,079
we won't mention any names up no

502
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,049
but he does two 14-year-old boys %uh
okay

503
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:16,649
a no more guessing a

504
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:20,949
I let's talk about cyber or for a little
bit is there

505
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:26,439
alright I'm a dumb shit that doesn't
know anything about technology but I'm

506
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,489
smart enough to

507
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:31,979
count how many people are doing deep
code research in this country in the

508
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:36,309
number 67 there are 67

509
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:41,019
people in the United States of America
doing deep code research and 12

510
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,059
those are doing defensive decode
research

511
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:49,089
how do you spend $12 billion dollars and
sixty seven people

512
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:53,489
you don't this is a cyber scams

513
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:58,619
you and I have written a detailed
article in Homeland Security today

514
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,809
that identifies the sixty-seven people
by Research Center none of which have

515
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:03,809
major grants

516
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:07,379
from the Department of Homeland
stupidity or

517
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:14,379
from an essay or any other party the US
government I'd like someone in the

518
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,529
audience to define decode research

519
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:22,668
humph

520
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:26,418
the way it was explained to me is source
code

521
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:31,598
Ruth I mean right down at the very
bottom which is

522
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,159
where do you hide shit at the very
bottom in source code

523
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,389
like I say I'm not a technical person
what who wants to define

524
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,909
decode research okay

525
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:48,139
binary analysis works for me also

526
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:51,169
I mean you can't hide a lot of stuff in
hardware

527
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:55,368
on that's why I believe in open source
hardware not just open source software

528
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:58,829
on open everything so

529
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:02,839
I'm really in concert with the details
what matters to me is that they're only

530
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,999
let's say five hundred people in the
united states that are actually doing

531
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:07,509
serious code research

532
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:11,859
and Washington is planning to spend $12
billion dollars on seic which totally

533
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,420
fucked up Trailblazer

534
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,869
for NSA on an SRA and

535
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:21,230
csce all these companies are

536
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,910
scamps they basically higher what we
call

537
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,660
butts in seats these are US citizens
with clearances you don't know jack shit

538
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,769
about anything

539
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:34,829
but they can be built okay

540
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,900
and this is a scam on

541
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,960
and part of the problem we have is that
the US government is now run by

542
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,049
contractors

543
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:47,239
contractors now occupying final
positions at every level of the National

544
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,309
Intelligence Community the national
security community we even have the

545
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:51,499
occasional Australia

546
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:55,380
who's given away too much authority on

547
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,700
just because they like his accent on can
call it comes to mind

548
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,900
you know he helped vitreous hose up
counterinsurgency

549
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,660
we should talk about Afghanistan to

550
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,660
IT security

551
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,629
is a very very serious in 1994 Jim
Anderson from an essay and when Shortell

552
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,599
and bilk alien I put together a memo

553
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,319
to the National Information national

554
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:30,420
and II national formation infrastructure
okay and we sent this to Marty harry

555
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,039
said we said Marty you have a problem
coming up this is nineteen ninety-four

556
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:34,440
now

557
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,859
back when I was told that was on the
lunatic fringe for thinking things like

558
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:39,319
this

559
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:44,980
we said Marty you need to spend a
billion dollars an information security

560
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,739
we need to make sure that SCADA systems
for example are not on the Internet

561
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:54,440
well I don't know whether party ever
read the letter but it is on my website

562
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,700
if he wants to read it

563
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,779
if he hasn't died since then on

564
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:04,329
stuff people know I mean the US
government was briefed about peak oil

565
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,220
for

566
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,799
and and the in 1974

567
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:12,950
and it knew about peak oil in it knows
about peak water in congress is

568
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,180
basically separately that for someone
else because we don't wanna make our

569
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,390
decisions

570
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,190
so I think information security is very
very important

571
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,190
and the easiest way to achieve it in my
AK

572
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,210
uneducated view is by going with open
source

573
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,750
I mean I love the Linux guys when they
say put enough eyeballs any bug is

574
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,109
visible

575
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:38,098
and I think the same is true for true
cost information the same is true for

576
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,450
corruption

577
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,759
%uh the same is true for absolutely
every aspect managing complex affairs

578
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:49,220
and let me just make a short a creche in
its complexity and resilience

579
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,680
the world has gotten too complicated for
Berrian

580
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,680
stovepipe management okay

581
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,149
basically Washington is trying to
regulate things it doesn't understand

582
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,369
and can't control because it's not in
real time

583
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:10,089
and they have not done the bottom-up
resilience building that's needed

584
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:13,529
alright so what we really have to think
about

585
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:17,230
is how do you make the whole thing open
and had to establish standards for

586
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,359
example I've tried three times with john
chambers

587
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,960
on to get him to build an individual
router

588
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,089
why can't we have application-oriented
networks

589
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:31,880
at are individual laptops

590
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,460
so that we can apply the rules to who
sees what

591
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,489
and how it's handled and so forth and

592
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:41,640
I don't know much about growth and
things like that but I personally

593
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,519
believe that we should be able to
install

594
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:47,970
information security including content
control and

595
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,450
and attributes and reach back routing
and all that

596
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,569
at the point if creation

597
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:58,839
soul somebody smarter than me is is
gonna figure that out

598
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,470
now does anyone wanna jump up with the
burning question are showing both 22 of

599
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,170
tossing

600
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:11,150
yes sir yeah I can use a microphone

601
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,559
eg got the go-ahead is a microphone and
checked the topic and you know there's

602
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,099
so many have you here I feel so bad

603
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:20,210
that this isn't some kind a circle how
many have you know about open space

604
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,720
technology

605
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,690
home I'm going to help you

606
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,599
on what do you can inject I with I was
thinking arm

607
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,099
the national debt yeah and um possibly
legalizing substances to

608
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,849
eliminated

609
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:43,079
I love it I mean marijuana absolutely
should be legalized

610
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,099
n/a and but

611
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:50,180
but hear me clearly it should not be
legalized so white boys can't get high

612
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,038
legally it should be legalized so we
stop putting blacks in prison

613
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:59,119
okay yeah aunque

614
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,549
I mean I personally want to eliminate
the personal income tax

615
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:07,599
on because it's a it's a fraud I mean we
should be doing consumption taxes we

616
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,829
should be doing the Tobin tax financial
Texas things like that Energex air

617
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:16,319
freudian voting machines and its use in
subverting recent elections

618
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,680
%uh its massive anybody stupid enough to
accept an electronic voting machine

619
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,578
deserves the result they get here

620
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,749
on and that there is a member in the
audience here

621
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:30,609
you is telling me that some very good
things are going to happen in that area

622
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,859
and I'm really excited about that

623
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:37,509
on you know computers were built without
talking to librarians

624
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:41,009
I mean this is the problem I have with
engineers is they don't recognize that

625
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:43,789
there are people out there that know
stuff

626
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:47,239
that's relevant for to the metal that
their ben de

627
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,710
on and so we've kinda lost sight of what
computers are energetic sharply

628
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,650
what I don't understand is a you know
real stuff about the

629
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,650
vote a king and and made sense to me

630
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,059
what happened in 2006 in 2000 and i'd

631
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,529
did did did the you know Republican
Party have

632
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:09,160
the ability to steal the election and if
so why did yes I mean first of the

633
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,730
election

634
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,539
in 2000 was stolen up by Jeb Bush and
everybody knew this in advance

635
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:19,259
on great pay last a friend of mine who
admire very much as a journalist he did

636
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:23,119
the story breaking it in the observer in
England three months at a time

637
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,930
and I am told by someone who knows
someone who was in the room that warren

638
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,828
christopher

639
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:32,549
brought the offer 24 from wall street
which basically said if you fight this

640
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:35,619
we're never gonna give you a speaking
fee in your lifetime

641
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:39,009
if you don't fight this you will be rich
beyond your dreams and

642
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:44,009
I don't think they threw in the Nobel
Prize for so it came to pass

643
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:48,739
what senator okay hang on it that's a
fraud

644
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:52,029
very strong as a criminal on

645
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:56,960
and dove but in 2004

646
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,930
the Ohio State Governor basically put
all the good machines in the probe which

647
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,200
districts in all the bad machines in the
black districts a democratic districts

648
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,380
and that election was stolen also
however you have to give

649
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,430
John Carey credit anybody with a fucking
haircut like that

650
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,049
is not qualified to be anything all
right for you

651
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:23,369
and she's married to a world-class pitch
okay

652
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:28,190
so the man is toast and and that's what
I mean by controlled opposition

653
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,680
okay I mean Carey was basically a fall

654
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,940
a staff always a very smart man and he
knows it george bush's sexually

655
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,349
conflicted as other ships okay

656
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:41,609
are because he was there up

657
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:46,119
but the reality is these elections he
just played out I wrote a book

658
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:49,420
collection 2008 lipstick on a pig

659
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,599
on and it's all free online now I notice
there's a group that you're so very

660
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,069
quickly let me get your questions and
interjections and then we'll move on out

661
00:42:57,069 --> 00:42:58,650
there any other microphones

662
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,759
I was where the front when the middle
okay go ahead

663
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,019
so I'm from Toronto we just had the g20
and I'm just wondering what your

664
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:06,769
thoughts are on the Black Bloc

665
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:10,359
if you know about them on the black
block

666
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:14,369
cell some other people have said that
their a allowed to exist

667
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,279
or are are fed by the police

668
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:22,829
and which is a black bloc energy yes
they they they break windows and there's

669
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:26,130
some reason there's no cops around but
hundreds of cameras

670
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:30,259
the sergeant police commented that the
they couldn't disclose their uses those

671
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:31,849
techniques

672
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:35,949
here well I don't want to bash the
Canadians

673
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:39,579
its okay yeah

674
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:44,829
good a look as soon as global warming a
writer take it over your country okay

675
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:48,920
for we're just waiting for it to get
warburg

676
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,410
a to a and by the way folks Quebec and
Scotland are the only two places again

677
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,660
have clean water if we don't get our act
together

678
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,489
on so I'm starting to learn French %uh

679
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:03,660
she Indiana decreed that clear a

680
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,118
so K look I'm in Guatemala where the
police

681
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,920
are a major part of the problem on and
if you read the

682
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,599
wanna my reviews so that Lance tales
book the CIA has a long history

683
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,670
up creating false insurgencies including
the Red Brigades and Italy

684
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:27,670
in order to then turn the government
away from so-called communism

685
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:31,230
toward their preferred fascism okay

686
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,940
on and the CIA also important so many
nazis into this country

687
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,359
that that we have our alright can call
Rosander

688
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:44,328
and others of their ilk on we also have
way too many

689
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:49,589
double national israeli US citizens with
top secret clearances in policy

690
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:50,910
positions

691
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,000
%uh where I think they should be
research firm size to whatever the

692
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,239
opposite is

693
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:58,269
a you know and so what if we miss a
little

694
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:01,640
%uh I you know but really we're still
fit

695
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,759
%uh so quick interjection they're quick
interjection here and then let's come

696
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:05,170
back

697
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,949
sure I just wanted to talk for a moment
about

698
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:13,089
probation kinda visit school to maintain

699
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:16,670
at a press conference lysed underclass
and

700
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,910
in reference what you were saying before
about intelligence being outsourced

701
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,049
an interesting thing to note i think is
that Erik Prince

702
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:29,299
was just not just recently but were it
was revealed that at one point in the

703
00:45:29,299 --> 00:45:30,719
not-too-distant past

704
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:33,730
he was actually on the payroll the CIA

705
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,150
he was doing intelligence work artprints
being the founders

706
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,989
yeah plan water yeah I A what you know
CIA's not very discriminating and who

707
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:42,949
hires

708
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,869
on they really do you deal with a lot of
fools

709
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:51,819
and they throw money around i mean CIA
had to close twenty of the twenty one

710
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:54,750
company said it created to do
non-official cover

711
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,699
they don't know how to run a business
arm

712
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:02,339
this is true it's in its in the media
and up by the way I'm way too smart to

713
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,140
make the security mistake appear

714
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,430
okay on sober or drunk on

715
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:12,419
and so nothing I say is a secret it's
just common sense it's out in the open

716
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,119
I honor my secrecy my lifetime secrecy
agreement

717
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,420
them and bringing drugs gun

718
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,920
I am so disappointed I

719
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,750
was sitting here breathless with
expectations fits just got them pay

720
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,809
okay so a a you know

721
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:37,849
CIA throws money around an essay throws
money around a

722
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:42,400
we're wasting $75 billion dollars here
in general tony's anyone other one other

723
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,239
last

724
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:47,619
serious adults that we have on says that
that provides

725
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:52,049
act best four percent but what the
president others need to know and when I

726
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:56,119
did my second graduate thesis on whether
US Embassy collected what got back to

727
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:57,289
washington

728
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:00,750
I realize that washington was running on
two percent other relevant available

729
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,710
information

730
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,829
what I did not realize was that
washington doesn't really give a shit

731
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:09,140
about whether it has information not
because it's running on ideology

732
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,960
okay and it's running on who pays for
what so come interject here

733
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,339
and just curious on and we talk a lot
about the puppets puppeteers all its for

734
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:19,000
the stuff you know

735
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,480
and and ultimately coming down to are
taking back the government

736
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,199
and with this is a thought that I gone
over a lot in my head

737
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:29,960
and I'm all non 90 answers and I'd love
to hear more

738
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,549
your real deep thoughts on how we as
people can take back to local

739
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:35,119
governments and build up from there

740
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,199
we totally I mean with out that because
I'm tired

741
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:42,980
giving my energy to have that system if
thank you and I hope others that have

742
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,069
deep passionate concerns will bring them
out here because

743
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:49,480
you know I'm I'm not the guy with all
the answers I just read more books in

744
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,230
you

745
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,319
on in it's because I have no life

746
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:56,319
on but

747
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,660
what did he say

748
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,730
for on

749
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:07,420
I'm working on that I'll I'm figure in
about twenty twelve

750
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,890
%uh you know but that's right actually
sex is way too much trouble unless

751
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,490
you've got the affection to go with it

752
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:19,360
in my humble opinion on flaw I i kno
don't feel sorry for me it's good

753
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,580
on you want to get deeply personal

754
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:30,120
for it

755
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,770
alright socially come back to the second
american revolution is still focus on

756
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,090
Mike got

757
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:41,360
for a on

758
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,190
this system has gone to show for it down
the toilet to

759
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,270
X that I'm not sure anything less than a
tax revolt

760
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:53,490
and a general strike will do home

761
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:58,110
I also believe we have the power I mean
I deal with some extreme

762
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:03,020
brightest in Latin America and and
they'd like to think that

763
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,920
the the higher and the wealthier guys
like to think that machine guns will

764
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,530
solve it

765
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,740
the lower and likes to just take a
machete and leave a severe head in front

766
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,850
of whatever ministry you're pissed off
at their

767
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:18,000
day on there aren't enough

768
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,430
machine guns on the planet to kill every
cockroach its gonna come out of the

769
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,060
woodwork

770
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,130
and where the cockroaches okay

771
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,060
on need more machine guns yo no
precision machine guns start was working

772
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,640
on that

773
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,790
little cockroach bullet okay this is the
place darpa hi I just can't believe it

774
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:40,110
darpa is spending money on a row but
that won't violate human rights

775
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,780
ish

776
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:49,250
I don't make this stuff up a you know if
we spent if we spent a fraction of what

777
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,000
we spend on war and peace I can solve
every problem on the planet for $230

778
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,970
billion a year

779
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:57,420
and we're spending 1.3 trillion on on
not just

780
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,280
when I think that spending on or we're
spending on contractors

781
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,840
okay on and we just had a wonderful
report come out

782
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,170
on the small arms were still playing
with take your choice on the battlefield

783
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:14,530
the the m1a1 whatever the hell they're
using now in Afghanistan is basically

784
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,150
affect about the three hundred meters

785
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,400
and the Taliban is picked us apart from
five hundred meters

786
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,230
on and oh by the way these are the guys
we train because the Taliban runs

787
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,550
everyone through the US Army training
program

788
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:29,150
so they can fatten them up a little bit
and learn all over tactics and then they

789
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,050
go back out and give them back to us

790
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:36,010
comment that makes no sense it'll but
we're not smart enough to figure that

791
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,420
out that's why biometrics is so big

792
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:42,780
you know on hand here in the US we like
to trade

793
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,260
the gates okay I mean Mrs now might good
buddies in the mars they figured out

794
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,240
it's not cool to have tattoos because

795
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,020
that kind of highlights the fact that
you're majorly criminal

796
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,840
who's willing to kill for ten dollars
okay on so now they're learning how to

797
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,320
dress up and get haircuts

798
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,220
on and they joined the US Army and they
become really good at this stuff and

799
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,710
then they go practice their trade in
Central America

800
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,460
on you know what could the country
trains its enemies to kill us

801
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,220
on cell I'm sorry I i've gotten
distracted me sick to our

802
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,680
tossing on interjection what

803
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,740
I have something I have yes us so you
already my big fear factor right now is

804
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,450
water

805
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,860
Marcellus Shale drilling slavery water

843
00:53:56,989 --> 00:54:03,989

850
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:33,420
here are the 10 high-level threats the
humanity

851
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,779
and you'll notice that let's see if this

852
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:43,779
what senator alright can you guys see
this

853
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:52,160

right

854
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,598

855
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:02,029
alright a you know everything I do is
free online

856
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:06,029
if you decide to buy the books jay-z is
out there selling the books and the

857
00:55:06,029 --> 00:55:06,880
t-shirts

858
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,339
and and of course I'd be grateful if you
did

859
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:16,480
but but everything is free online
alright this is the ocean staff briefing

860
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,220
which has some pretty cool graphic
Senate

861
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,259
and I'll just use one and then we'll
come to you very quickly

862
00:55:22,259 --> 00:55:28,130
on the problem where with government and
with corporations is

863
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:32,989
number one they don't have a strategic
analytic model on and number two

864
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:37,220
they %uh they don't actually do analysis
this is the

865
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:43,339
this is the graphic the UN it's not as
bad as it is is bad actually as most

866
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:46,349
people think but only because it listens
to its member states

867
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:52,650
arm wants the UN separates itself from
the member states that lie to it and

868
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:56,509
populate it with spies and I don't mind
the spice taking people to launch

869
00:55:56,509 --> 00:56:01,049
bike to mine the spice being really
incompetent at their coverage ox

870
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:04,930
because what that means is the UN is
one-third nepotism

871
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:08,789
and one-third spies it don't know what
to do in a humanitarian crisis and that

872
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:12,059
one-third real people that are carrying
the entire you want on their back

873
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:16,989
okay of but the UN came up with a high
level threat panel came up with the 10

874
00:56:16,989 --> 00:56:18,470
high-level threats the humanity

875
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:22,609
and i really respect this is Brent
Scowcroft as part of this group

876
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:25,670
so poverty disease ecology can all see
their

877
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,759
in the back F

878
00:56:28,759 --> 00:56:32,029
500 you're teaching me shit alright hang
on

879
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:39,029
up please don't talk dirty

880
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:47,150
alright control shift I tried now

881
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,550
is a great briefed by the way

882
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:58,580
a and unfortunately it did not get me
the job that I wanted

883
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:02,369
which okay so

884
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:05,720
10 high-level threats humanity and then
I

885
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,760
I was about the summit company for ten
million and I was gonna give $5 to my

886
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,090
wife and five to my non-profit which
Casey is running

887
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:19,160
but I recruited 24 really high value
people including that Radcliffe said

888
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,359
John Roemer bunch a good people at a
Seattle and

889
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:28,859
we basically looked at the presidential
transition things for the last 25 years

890
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:32,580
and came up with 12 policies that really
matter that must be

891
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,700
addressed intended from agriculture
through water for example it makes no

892
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,680
sense to use water we don't have

893
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,480
to grow grain we can eat to fuel cars
that should be running on natural gas

894
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,210
from Canada or should actually be melted
down and turned in the train wheels

895
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:54,460
okay on so this is this is holistic
analysis and I've created four major

896
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,770
strategic analytic models in my lifetime

897
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:03,490
and I it stuns me that the US government
and CIA in particular

898
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:07,170
and major corporations are completely in
apt

899
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,520
on

900
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,130
that's a really really good question on
the question is how do we fight Monsanto

901
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,740
and so forth i mean this whole thing off

902
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,820
up one generation seeds is criminal
that's that's a

903
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:27,320
you can't you can I write look at some
point hang on you gotta stand in line

904
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,600
because at some point at some point
we're gonna have to understand that the

905
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,619
laws are illegal

906
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:35,780
okay on

907
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:41,260
and we're gonna have to go with common
sense now please interject here

908
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,890
you were are talking about Afghanistan
allows a massive

909
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:48,250
fuck his name is Kay few general in just
recently got fired

910
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:51,650
you might think that all McChrystal
address the area

911
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,359
crystal is an extremely

912
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,509
competent colonel the cup promoted above
is great arm

913
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:03,040
and that's most of our flag officers
most of our address

914
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,460
they've won the beauty contest their
house broken

915
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:12,250
%uh they're willing to confuse their
oath to support the Constitution

916
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,400
with they substitute loyalty to the
chain of command

917
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,320
alright when we swear an oath to the
Constitution we swear an oath to defend

918
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,580
it against all enemies domestic and
foreign I do believe domestic comes

919
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,200
first

920
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,880
okay so that for me basically means the
Republican Party the Democratic Party

921
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,000
every political appointee and government

922
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,190
on and most certainly

923
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,800
any president dumb enough to not
actually trying to intelligence-driven

924
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,750
government and it's not about Tom
Obama's very smart simply been bought

925
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:45,570
and paid for

926
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:49,940
and so this bill bradley bill bradley is
working for one of the top Wall Street

927
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,560
firms

928
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,690
on he basically sold out and all these
guys kinda see the tea leaves that they

929
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,820
decide we're not worth fighting for

930
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:01,770
K that's the bottom line on bill bradley

931
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,880
we were not worth fighting for and that
really hurts me

932
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,810
I take it personally on interjection
related to the topic a fiat

933
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:15,009
Kuroda upstarts pick up please related
to the topic a fiat currency how much

934
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,680
your

935
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,940
current control is there in this country

936
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,119
in the government military perhaps
business

937
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:28,410
by the Masons I don't know up but I will
tell you that I think the rock trials

938
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,649
firmly control

939
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:32,790
%uh the New York Federal Reserve and the

940
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:36,560
national federal reserve which is
neither federal or reserve

941
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,080
and the secretary-treasurer if you look
at who's been secretary at the Treasury

942
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,770
for the last five or six
administrations'

943
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:46,940
it has always been someone from Goldman
Sachs arm

944
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,010
and soul what what I really see

945
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:54,000
is a very deliberate plan to devalue the
US dollar

946
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,340
but they've already both the other
assets overseas these guys are building

947
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,520
bunkers and Dubai

948
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,009
okay they've already got their 75
urchins

949
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:05,710
it's a I think they went to West
Virginia or someplace you know

950
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:10,240
maybe that's the right state but I

951
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,030
they've got their virgin set up that
waiting for the medicaid is case both

952
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:19,600
%uh you know it's only a our money is
worthless

953
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:25,850
on and really for us maybe I still
remember and no camp dating myself now

954
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:30,210
I would get 35 cents to go see a movie
and buy popcorn

955
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:34,950
25 cents for the movie at 10 cents for
the popcorn who else remember set

956
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:38,680
II we got 48 guys in the room okay

957
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,190
what

958
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:49,190
what it is

959
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:54,320
that's a hard question %uh

960
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,920
go online the reason about the

961
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,770
mason's I ask when we look at a map
Washington DC

962
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:05,980
course good being Google Earth Gibson
you see the big pentagram

963
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:10,130
refine his power to the white house yep
plus the other Masonic said well I do I

964
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,050
do believe that

965
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:15,320
I do believe that Washington was laid
out in a masonic patter

966
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,330
and I absolutely love these so these

967
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:21,430
dan Brown movies and stuff

968
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:25,330
and I you know I mean it's really
interesting because number one

969
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:30,790
the the Rothschilds and company did not
plan on the nuclear bomb the nuclear

970
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:31,610
bomb

971
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,720
messed up their plants because it kinda
made

972
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,980
or unprofitable for large number of
people and so they had the backwash from

973
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:40,890
nuclear

974
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,650
and and event low-intensity conflict
okay and if you read my review of the

975
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:49,380
book on land sale where the Philippines
basically we invented terrorists

976
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,690
and in in vietnam we bombed buddhist

977
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:57,610
temples okay and so basically we've done
a lot of evil

978
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:00,660
lot of people has been done in our day

979
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,940
on there's a book that I reviewed

980
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,800
I I think it's called ruled by secrecy
and the last chapter

981
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,600
you know the last chapter is about
aliens and and Emmanuel as mentioned

982
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,630
on and %uh its

983
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:21,240
it's a very very good book in my review
I did not mention the alien parts I will

984
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,890
tell you I absolutely believe an
extraterrestrial

985
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:28,069
intelligence and I also believe with the
gentleman who was on TV a few months ago

986
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,610
thanks were under quarantine

987
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:34,670
because we scare on I mean we're just
like an out-of-control

988
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:38,030
or work you will be assimilated yes sir

989
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:42,640
in your lifetime do you think that
you'll see ya

990
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,500
North American Union the short answer is
no I think I'll see vermont secede from

991
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,630
the union first

992
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:55,800
alright there are 5,000 secession
movements around the world

993
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,160
an indigenous peoples and I really do
wanna talk about

994
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:02,120
what we can learn from indigenous
peoples and how much we've ignored sir

995
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,370
would you like to interject

996
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:08,290
sure upset a a couple questions um the
some tell apps book

997
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:11,540
the Black Swan did you read yes was
thinkin

998
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:16,360
I liked it honor it was for me very very
interesting

999
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:22,050
on one of the problems that we have is
an industrial society tends to build up

1000
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,240
its attention

1001
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,420
capability toward what it knows and it's
really

1002
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,220
rock at weak signals and it's also
really rotten

1003
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:36,340
at forecasting and it's really run
sharing information or making

1004
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,780
connections across

1005
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,400
a boundaries so I liked it on

1006
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,800
one of the things I also like is the
precautionary principle

1007
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,330
but let me ask you what did you think a
bit and what kinda point are you trying

1008
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,120
to make

1009
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,279
well besides him being a bitter blow
hard I think

1010
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,540
it was ponders usually are yeah up

1011
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:00,270
it was a a very interesting read but the
reason every night as I got this top

1012
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:04,190
question my talk I want to pose to you
in doing risk analysis

1013
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:07,420
have what at what point do we stop
adding

1014
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:11,590
like the ridiculously improbable events
that are massively

1015
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:16,070
value so Ian he's going of things like
that

1016
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:20,160
is there a cut-off point at which we
should stop worrying about them because

1017
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,870
they're so impotent as my probable

1018
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:25,460
or should we include everything
including zombies well

1019
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:29,020
it's your night some of my best friends
is on pace on

1020
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:32,710
I actually would flip thing on you

1021
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:37,980
I me take this cell phones & B's on you
know there's a scientific principle the

1022
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,430
precautionary principle

1023
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:43,040
or and I mean we're our own worst enemy

1024
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:47,790
and soul what I think we should be
focusing on is the obvious what can we

1025
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,080
not do that we're doing to ourselves now

1026
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,990
and until we've cracked that one forget
about all the infinite s cool stuff

1027
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:59,670
%uh there's an excellent book by Charles
Perrault who also wrote high-tech

1028
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:06,230
what is your rate was the first title
high-risk

1029
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,190
living with high-risk technology
whatever but he's written a book called

1030
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,240
catastrophe

1031
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,670
in which he points out that one chemical
disaster from one Cory

1032
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:20,190
tank that is already %uh rusted out at
the bottom on this New Jersey Turnpike

1033
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,820
on in the new york city

1034
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,650
I mean that is worse than a thousand
terrorist incidents

1035
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:31,170
on what we do every day to ourselves and
toxins not just

1036
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:34,520
electronic trash but what we do with
food

1037
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:40,100
the subsidies that we provide but to
cattle that shit our spinach

1038
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:45,590
what yeah I mean oil spills you don't
love this stuff

1039
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:50,380
is insane I mean it really is literally
insane

1040
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,980
on and so this strategic analytic model

1041
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,490
these two little red things here is
where the US government is putting all

1042
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:58,820
of your money

1043
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,270
and it's not really putting your money
against the threats

1044
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:05,520
it's putting your money in the
contractors who pay congressman and in

1045
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,960
fairness to the contractors is the
congressman there shaking down

1046
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,720
the contractors not the contract is
trying to bribe the congressman

1047
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,000
okay so I mean america is the root of
corruption on this planet

1048
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,520
in my opinion and that's what we've got
to get it

1049
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,360
so I would change your question and
basically say let's get back to

1050
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,720
fundamentals

1051
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:32,060
and stop putting the ball in our head
lol we worry about syphilis in our toes

1052
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,830
that kinda I'm sorry I overreached on
that when I blew it

1053
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:39,390
you over here sir

1054
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:44,020
well I kinda have bernie keefer in class
and ask for

1055
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:47,370
I also with he likes you you get your
slides

1056
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:50,750
and to you hear you talk about work
tossing self

1057
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,390
action gonna do we have a dwarf in a row

1058
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:58,640
a small girl will do and that's a wrap
up this round make

1059
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,650
but that's all right he said okay

1060
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,490
double what's your burning questions go
with it

1061
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:09,600
go diversity matters okay

1062
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:16,600
its okay dude is just that fight dude
and the call dude since the sixties

1063
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:21,100
you well took a good guy

1064
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,000
I'm I'm feeling you I mean I've been
reading your stuff I hope you're feeling

1065
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,520

1066
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,770

1069
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:42,050
attack in you know they've reality-based
community seemed

1070
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:45,180
have waived putting think out there as
like

1071
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:48,450
factual that just art so

1072
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:53,420
give me an example so for well for
example yesterday you're saying that the

1073
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,580
Obama campaign had gathered $750 million

1074
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:01,600
in financing which three hundred dollars
$3 million is

1075
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,990
unaccounted for so

1076
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:10,910
that was also today perhaps in case I
felt I think that a try so

1077
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:15,010
other are you saying that's untrue I'm
asking you other than your own

1078
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:18,620
ass do you actually have a factual
source I read it

1081
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:32,550
very heavy-handed additional united go
to bed

1082

here

1092
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:23,820
where it was at hipster

1093
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:28,759
you think a it says boy it then it's you
have to go to let that means you just

1094
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,310
really didn't even really you just kinda
thought this was true you did

1095
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:39,210
yesterday but when you've read all 1600
my book reviews get back to me

1096
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:46,210
for

1097
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,340
an hour that's so more like any raise it
on

1098
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:04,340
I

1099
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:33,150
I you know it's it's a it's really up to
you

1100
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:38,259
up because I could spend the rest of the
night doing this kind of stuff for Aiken

1101
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:44,170
move fast %uh

1102
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,460
if someone wants a search for it and
then bring it up here

1103
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:52,240
that would be a public service at least
one so

1104
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,469
you know a it's out there

1105
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:59,860
%uh I mean are you aware that he
promised he would use public campaign

1106
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,750
financing them broke that promise

1107
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:06,740
no I'm asking you are you aware of that
okay so that that

1108
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:13,150
fact few if you got some to prove it
alright

1109
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:19,700
let's move on yes sir go on and yes
health care we should talk about health

1110
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,630
care im adding that

1111
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:25,930
right after drawers I'm I wanted to ask
you a question regarding a

1112
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:29,350
afghanis on an oz props drawing on your
experience

1113
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:33,080
oz was an intelligence officer under the
former infantryman

1114
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,480
and that is doesn't the wesson presence
in Afghanistan

1115
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,750
kind al Qaeda exactly what they want

1116
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,900
the first of all kate is not there
anymore %uh it's just the Tolly bon

1117
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,250
Homme we created in 1990

1118
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:51,030
and all by the way every dollar they get
comes courtesy of us

1119
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:56,019
%uh we took opium from zero to eighty
percent of the world's supply

1120
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:00,320
we enrich Musharraf in Pakistan because
that's where the number for opium

1121
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,740
I mean with the open becomes number for
heroin on

1122
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:08,340
and the bottom line is we should not be
in Afghanistan or should we be in Iraq

1123
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,660
on I will I will I will

1124
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:17,230
go a step further of the US haiti is an
excellent example of how screwed up the

1125
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,140
US government US military are

1126
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:23,120
on day one in the high 80

1127
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,160
I started blogging about peace jumpers
which is a concept

1128
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,190
have been discussing with the colonel
who created and I'm getting you guys

1129
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:32,820
will go through your whole line as soon
as we're done here

1130
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:37,360
on basically high 80 was an immediate
problem

1131
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:42,700
love water on a basic food

1132
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:46,380
followed by sanitation supplies followed
by

1133
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,180
10 th and then it was a secondary
problems

1134
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:54,540
upbringing in a ton of stuff through six
airports and six ports

1135
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:58,260
the US military was only able to find
one port and one airport

1136
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:03,710
how they miss the other five I do not
know up but the reality is

1137
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:07,720
SOUTHCOM decided that they needed to
send in twenty thousand troops with

1138
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,830
rifles in a long logistics tail

1139
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:13,519
rather than focus on delivering the
basics okay

1140
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,790
on soul what we have in the US
government and bob gates should know

1141
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,090
better okay

1142
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:25,630
got you sir X come on up here come on up
here

1143
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:29,280
I want them to see your face up

1144
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,120
here I want you to take that and this my

1145
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,180
might be goofy I when I'm reading is

1146
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,940
wanna wait there's another way to do it
I will gonna leave that there and I look

1147
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,660
forward

1148
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:43,769
on my own because you've given me Obama
should

1149
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,660
can somebody get a picture okay

1150
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:51,030
on hold on hold on I need a I need the
title arm

1151
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:54,889
bookmarks see this is an example of
collective intelligence

1152
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,400
on the group is greater than the
individual

1153
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,150
on just Obama what

1154
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:06,990
let me do the title that's that's more
fun because it's easier for others to

1155
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,040
replicate to

1156
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,430
most likely 48 48

1157
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:17,490
FEC on it here week

1158
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:20,920
all done and dunno

1159
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,290
it is second one

1160
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:29,050
0 Obama shrug if you guys are wonderful

1161
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:32,840
okay thank you

1162
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:38,130
very research you wonderful okay

1163
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:41,850
on I think this'll do soul

1164
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:45,400
there it is yes bro

1165
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:50,230
from file you know when I

1166
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:53,780
when I wrote the article at Whole Earth
review no

1167
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:58,059
up call the 3i ethics ecology evolution
and intelligence an alternative paradigm

1168
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,630
for national security

1169
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:02,720
it was circulated in a 7-4 at CIA

1170
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,900
and ross stapleton Grey Goose now

1171
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:11,260
very comfortable in California told me
that Santa Cruz when said this confirms

1172
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,800
steals place on the water to crash

1173
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,440
on I am used to being called a lunatic
I'm used to being questioned

1174
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,730
on and I just hope that this crowd

1175
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:26,310
is having fun because I really care

1176
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:30,210
about trying to get this kinda stuff out
on the table on

1177
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:34,540
and I believe Obama has missed a
precious opportunity

1178
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:38,420
because had he actually done a good
staff in Haiti actually chosen to play a

1179
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,250
nonpartisan game

1180
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:45,370
he not only could have been reelected he
could have repealed term limits

1181
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:48,490
for himself he had an opportunity

1182
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:51,760
22 bring the country together and so did
Bush

1183
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,590
I mean bush is a well-meaning adult and

1184
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:58,730
he really did think of himself as a
uniter

1185
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:02,450
but Karl Rove and Dick Cheney just wiped
him out

1186
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,929
so there was nothing he could do alright
still

1187
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:08,940
very quickly going hang out very no
you're done

1188
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:12,630
very quickly going back to water on

01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:19,630
you have to do the whole thing your you

1190
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:29,910
be sick and

1191
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:33,599
I okay arm

1192
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,810
let me let me get back to that briefing

1193
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:40,910
because there is some what did I wanna
show you guys

1194
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,940
shoot alright I'll

1195
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,570
I'll leave it alone for now are I wanna
very quickly run through your points

1196
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:51,940
back there and they come up here and
then will do little to our thing and

1197
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:52,950
some health care

1198
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:56,389
and after a water on

1199
01:17:56,390 --> 01:18:00,000
oh yeah you know what I really do want
that briefing hang on a second

1200
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,010
DOD DOD

1201
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:07,290
073 because it's such a fundamental fake

1202
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:12,580
on you have to analyze everything I mean
Robert aikoff is one of my favorite

1203
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:14,170
people he likes to say

1204
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:18,380
that you gotta stop doing the wrong
thing right here

1205
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,570
which is what we're trying to do and you
gotta do the right things okay

1206
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:26,340
and ice just see we got here

1207
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:30,370
I want you to I want to see this one

1212
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:48,730
intelligence monograph

1213
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:53,240
the book intelligence for

1214
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:57,450
free online here's the one on WTC
collapse stated that the US government

1215
01:18:57,450 --> 01:19:01,650
release okay here we go todo sent
leadership and staff briefings

1216
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:06,240
are these are the ones I prepared my in
my competition for the position apps are

1217
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,780
for open source intelligence

1218
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:12,059
I was not even interviewed even on the
pope for open source intelligence

1219
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,600
and general clapper and general Burgess
basically gave up their integrity on

1220
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,260
that one on

1221
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:22,710
and I feel sorry for them on now let me
just show you this

1222
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:26,490
this holistic slide which I hope is in
this briefing

1223
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:30,190
up because what you have to do is you
have to see the 10 threats

1224
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:34,350
and you have to see the 12 policies and
then you have to consider water

1225
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:37,980
or corruption or energy in relation to

1226
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:41,270
all of them because what's good for one
part of the system

1227
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,300
may be very bad for another part of the
system sections using water to flush

1228
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:50,520
oil or you know there's this wonderful
book diet for a small planet and its

1229
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,910
basic point is that

1230
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:56,320
a pound of beef requires five thousand
pounds water to put on your plate where

1231
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,929
is a tomato requires 20

1232
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:01,370
and oh by the way the tomato doesn't
shape your spinach

1233
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:06,900
okay on so it's it's really quite quite
fascinating on

1234
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,060
no I am NOT on

1235
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:15,610
but I have given up close on and
gambling and I never smoked

1236
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:19,809
on and I'm moving toward being a
vegetarian I'm just waiting for to taste

1237
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:20,190
better

1238
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:25,070
I can help with that if you like are you
can

1239
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:29,849
what no ni gotta stop the soil so is

1240
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:36,850
is still asking if I yet

1241
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:48,189
why what's at f5 stuff

1242
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:54,880
alright

1243
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,660
look at this look at this and this will
close kinda water

1244
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:04,590
on energy time time is the one thing you
cannot buy nor replace

1245
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:08,310
on it comes at a colin grace modern
strategy on

1246
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:12,550
changes to the planet that used to take
10,000 years now take three years

1247
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:15,630
so we have to get to real time science
the problem is

1248
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:19,840
and I have a slight I can show you that
take leave an impression created

1249
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,030
we fragmented knowledge I mean the the
old adage we know everything there is to

1250
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:24,950
know about nothing

1251
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:30,190
the humanities are all over the lot
sciences all over the lot

1252
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:35,740
the social scientist Sir and I think an
appropriate phrase

1253
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:39,690
from

1254
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:43,670
a incredibly stupid

1255
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:49,880
on is I'm sorry it's very weak but I me
social sciences just nothing it's it's

1256
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,910
it's abysmal

1257
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:55,860
are and so you have to look at all these
things in connection with one another

1258
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:59,440
up because everything matters

1259
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:05,660
for example the poor are the biggest
threat to environmental degradation

1260
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:08,920
okay not corporations

1261
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:12,180
the water that we as individuals waste

1262
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:16,510
while shaving is much greater then what
corporations waste

1263
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,950
effect corporations are starting to get
in touch with true cost

1264
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:23,099
mom what was the other thing that you
guys didn't know about

1265
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:27,440
biomimicry no open space technology

1266
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,520
if forgive me I'm gonna take just one
second to talk about the space

1267
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,410
technology

1268
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:35,800
on Harris said no one has a brilliant
man

1269
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:39,580
and he invented open space technology
and I'd love to see hackers do this one

1270
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,330
of these days

1271
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:43,960
which is basically everybody shows up in
one big world

1272
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,050
everybody who has a compelling issue or
topic

1273
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:50,060
and maybe we could do this with my
session in two years

1274
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:54,700
for what senator I don't know

1275
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,540
but basically everyone shows up everyone
is a pressing issue right sat on a piece

1276
01:22:58,540 --> 01:22:59,370
of paper

1277
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:03,170
you take an hour to read the issues and
then those are posted

1278
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:06,920
and then you sign up and based on the
sign up aren't you

1279
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:11,650
do groups and the person who posted it
then brings a report out and ideally you

1280
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,830
also have a wiki

1281
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:16,640
so you have a distributed worldwide
network that's also participating

1282
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:20,780
and so it's a self-organizing collective
mind and it works

1283
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:24,340
Peggy petty Holman has a new book out

1284
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,530
on emerging evolutionary consciousness
time at Lee has reflections on

1285
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:32,610
evolutionary consciousness are to really
works

1286
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:36,559
so I i encourage you to think about open
space technology

1287
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,670
I I don't know why he put the word
technology in their

1288
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:43,480
but it's basically open space
community-minded building

1289
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,860
and its extraordinarily impressive and
it's vastly better than that program

1290
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:52,290
structures are let's run real quick
through your issues and then appear

1291
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:57,220
and then I'll go on again on our talkin
now ur talkin thank you

1292
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:00,510
okay just very quickly you guys and then
we'll come up here

1293
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:04,100
her thoughts on Jesse Ventura I love
them

1294
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,890
I love them Jess even turn Sarah Palin
are my dream team

1295
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:14,170
on now come on I take Sarah Palin
seriously

1296
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:19,630
on the bush campaign and I'm sorry it's
the McCain campaign but the bushes

1297
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:22,440
you know I tried to get through to
McCain on a couple things and failed

1298
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,010
miserably

1299
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:27,100
Sarah Palin should never never

1300
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,680
ever had been represented as someone who
reads okay

1301
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:35,140
this was a tactical mistake

1302
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,920
and I think it was deliberate it was the
bush campaign's way

1303
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,140
love kind of demeaning her Sarah Palin
has her own woman

1304
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,280
she is legitimately won the governorship
and

1305
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,809
in alaska gets the couple male assholes
and

1306
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:53,090
on she should have been america's mom

1307
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:57,080
and after doing her wonderful species it
is a look folks

1308
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,610
I don't know shit about showing all but
I absolutely guarantee you I'm gonna be

1309
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:03,519
the last person the neck John McCain
before he goes to bed

1310
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,820
and he will hear from you through May
Day

1311
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:12,450
and that for me works I absolutely trust
Sarah Palin to make a pain in the ass

1312
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:13,620
ever self

1313
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:18,710
are all day in front of the president
and and the president meets someone like

1314
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:19,620
that

1315
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:23,500
are when lee iacocca was thinking about
running for president someone came in

1316
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,410
and said well these are your positions
and he kicked him in the head this room

1317
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,720
at the door

1318
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:31,020
that's the kinda president we need okay
and so

1319
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:35,910
vice-presidents should be heard from and
unfortunately vice-presidents today or

1320
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:38,980
one down from the guy that cleans the
toilet the White House

1321
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:44,010
a so it's not good gonna get let's clean
up their own

1322
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:48,530
I got a little late so much recovered
this I didn't you may have discussed

1323
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:51,710
corporate ineptitude its governance over
a blind society

1324
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:56,280
much ur butter did you mention the
extract disaster

1325
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:59,599
no what is it the ex stock the stock oil
disaster

1326
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,090
1979 no happen it happen a little thing
called the

1327
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:06,580
JMX away we miss that one yeah in a good
have

1328
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:11,710
have people Wikipedia that it was
basically verbatim exactly what happened

1329
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:14,980
with BP happened in June love

1330
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:19,730
a 1978 of the Gulf of Mexico in the
government's goal of a Mexican

1331
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,800
side same company owned the well

1332
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,380
same problems and it took them 10 months

1333
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:31,780
to stop the oil from spilling into the
Gulf I and the use things like

1334
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:36,099
jump shots and attempted kidnapping and
attempted

1335
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:40,570
relief well drilling & and I'm ash I'm
not sure if sciences

1336
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:44,290
really caught up in know is done earlier
years it's not about

1337
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:47,860
it's not about science and and my
briefing is now online

1338
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,469
at 580 iota on

1339
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:54,760
and I'm just gonna show you one slide
because what we have is what's called

1340
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,800
information asymmetry

1341
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,730
on and these are deliberate and what's
interesting is that the cell phones

1342
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:05,570
are are starting to eliminate those
information asymmetry is

1343
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:09,490
on and real quick though if anybody want
to check it out

1344
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,750
X stocks okay how to thank you how the
hell ain't you

1345
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:17,090
how do you spell that sa stop stop nah
XT oh stop

1346
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:24,090
next next

1347
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:27,680
the question is is al Qaeda the at the

1348
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,740
best-case the CIA these

1349
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:35,410
people gone bad %uh shooting the AM the
short answer is No the saudis funded

1350
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:37,330
okay to see I did not

1351
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:41,190
we didn't we create a name find them in
training

1352
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:45,080
well the base is a translation and I'm
not I'm not

1353
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:50,620
a a supreme expert on this up but my
understanding having read most to the

1354
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:54,260
books and and talk I've actually I'm
friends with no beer and Jack

1355
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,980
divine and mill was the chief the
station for

1356
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:02,170
Afghanistan and Pakistan and Jack was
the

1357
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:06,100
Jack was the guy who manage the Afghan

1358
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:10,540
task force which sent stuff and I'll
here we go

1359
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:13,950
okay now this is a problem that we have

1360
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:18,280
yah I shift actually mine does it on f5
but okay but it doesn't go right to the

1361
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,230
page

1362
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:22,580
on

1363
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:26,760
what we've allowed to happen this is the
t-shirt thing that I did not have in a

1364
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,020
brief the other day

1365
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:33,070
on what we have allowed to happen is all
of these things

1366
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:37,040
and these are all books there absolutely
wonderful forbidden knowledge lost

1367
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,400
history manufacturing consent missing
information

1368
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,780
okay this is where you guys come in we
had the truth

1369
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:48,000
we get the truth on the table we use
cell phones to inform

1370
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,350
we no longer allow CNN to be piped in
the elevators

1371
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:55,390
okay

1372
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:59,450
cell phone what hormone

1373
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:03,720
well this is true but I but yes i'd that
that's absolutely true but in

1374
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:10,720
and and Central America they've solved
that problem everybody has 10 SIM cards

1375
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:15,019
and they trade offer like baseball cards
on

1376
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:18,670
so there are ways around that and I
really do think that we have to protect

1377
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,290
privacy privacy is absolutely vital

1378
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:26,090
on and and I think that's the kinda
stuff you guys should be thinking about

1379
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:28,680
from where I sit hackers have grown up

1380
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:34,560
on and for they ignored me in 1994 when
I told them to create a

1381
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,850
a public site that put every
vulnerability on display 30 days after

1382
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,230
the company was given

1383
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:45,490
notice but I really think these are the
tough issues that we have to deal with

1384
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:49,599
cell phones are killing bees bees are
central to the agricultural cycle

1385
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,910
we should be raising holy hell about
their are

1386
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:56,650
but again this whole idea of controlled
opposition you know CNN does a story

1387
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:58,050
about says okay that's covered

1388
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:02,590
and we move on on so this is the stuff
we've got a deal with that

1389
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:06,460
more back there and I will come up here
have you had a chance to read creature

1390
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,070
from Jekyll I'm

1391
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,290
no I have not for X

1392
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:14,660
actually okay and one other thing such
started doing is putting

1393
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:18,990
I guess the reviews on 58 I at all I'll
take a look at that book yes sir

1394
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:22,250
Salem are you talked about yesterday I
open source intelligence

1395
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:25,480
and I we had an amazing talks afternoon
from my

1396
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:29,210
WikiLeaks I'm just wanna know your
thoughts are with you X

1397
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:32,490
well on the one hand they've been very
responsible

1398
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:36,389
on in in penetrating for penetrating
sake

1399
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:40,250
on and they've done a few things that my
friend Steven Aftergood have secrecy

1400
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,860
news that the federal

1401
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:46,420
Federation of American scientists
doesn't like and I respect that

1402
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:50,320
if steve is not happy with WikiLeaks
they should pay attention

1403
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:55,070
however wiki leaks is inherently
democratic thing

1404
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:58,450
and I personally support the individual
who leaked the

1405
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:04,940
helicopter video and 250,000 cables

1406
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:09,800
and the reason I support that individual
whatever his motives

1407
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:15,050
is our government does not have carte
blanche to lie cheat and steal in our

1408
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:16,090
name

1409
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:19,670
and so we need to get to the bomb into
that and the historians for the state

1410
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:23,510
department are very upset that CIA is
ignoring the law

1411
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:27,230
with respect to declassify information
without which you cannot write the

1412
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:29,970
foreign policy history the United States

1413
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:35,670
if you really look at it closely CIA is
at the root of many over problems around

1414
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,260
the world including

1415
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:41,600
overthrowing a democratic election in
Iran and installing a dictator in

1416
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,810
Guatemala

1417
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:47,460
mom CIA is I'm very ashamed to say

1418
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:51,570
Tom Hateley really screw this up big
time and I sent them a direct fax at the

1419
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,259
time so I know he knew

1420
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:59,440
what he was doing on the United States
America's best pals with 42 of the 44

1421
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,320
dictators on the planet

1422
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:05,549
I recommend Ambassador Mark palmer's
book or my review other

1423
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:09,400
every every book I mention I review on

1424
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,410
he's he's written a wonderful book
called breaking the real axis a vehicle

1425
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:15,680
I can put every dictator out a business
in five years

1426
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:19,340
we offer them a very graceful exit plan
that gets all of them

1427
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:22,970
ten to twenty thirty million dollars
they'll never have to worry we can give

1428
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:23,920
that to them

1429
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,120
intergenerational trust 36 generations
out

1430
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,380
and the ones that don't agree we kill
them are

1431
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:35,360
but one bullet one man we should not
have to carpet bomb a village looking

1432
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,799
for somebody

1433
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,690
yeah well no no no no I really I there's
some potatoes are really good guys you

1434
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:43,350
know

1435
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:47,300
now the point is no I tell you what I've
learned what I've learned is you never

1436
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,480
wanna put someone's back to the wall

1437
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:54,680
okay and so the bottom line is it's a
vastly cheaper to have a nonviolent exit

1438
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,670
strategy

1439
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:58,580
than it is to put everybody on alert
because they think you're coming

1440
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:00,040
together

1441
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:04,960
year and so the bottom line is I am a
merciless bastard but I'm also a

1442
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,570
calculating merciless pastor

1443
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:11,910
yep a at No non-violence really does
work okay

1444
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:15,290
let's come up here real quick a little
better thank you to

1445
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:19,790
to exposing not not just exposing some
the truth and the reality but also

1446
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:23,310
I'm charging us taxi go ahead and and
see them on our side

1447
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:26,600
on you really inspired that means years
ago

1448
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:32,080
but a big part of that which is better
to call action everyone here

1449
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:36,370
is the I'm the clouds in fives

1450
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:39,880
and it starts with our food I thought
you were to talk about Google trying to

1451
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:40,990
be the cloud

1452
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:44,110
I mean that I mean it start to their
food sucks hearings that we take into

1453
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:44,719
ourselves

1454
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,890
yes and these are the things that create
the deceptions but then

1455
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:51,610
come up with the real world real world
is the matrix

1456
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:55,130
that's been presented to ourselves so if
you wanna see the real world

1457
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:58,470
we need to take out those clouds that
were seen

1458
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:01,840
I'm not gonna hold hands with you but I
agree %uh

1459
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:06,260
no actually you know food the we're
poisoning ourselves or poisoning our

1460
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,300
children

1461
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:10,330
I just reviewed a wonderful book by a
woman called

1462
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:13,510
the it was basically

1463
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:17,110
her kids didn't get to watch TV they
didn't get immunization and they were

1464
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,589
home-schooled

1465
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:22,210
and they turned out to be really nice
kids

1466
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:27,480
and what senator

1467
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,630
corner case well now that wasn't the
name in the book but but just

1468
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:35,160
goal review look for on 58 I had a what
are the things I really like about word

1469
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,860
presses the search engine works

1470
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:43,280
within the within the thing so you can
go in the 5800 to and search for review

1471
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:48,030
home-schooled and and get to what you're
looking for so let's stop there because

1472
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:49,590
you've done your commercial

1473
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:53,820
and and it's one I share love you on yes
sir

1474
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:57,599
thank you sir a movie extra Bradley
Manning and the other WikiLeaks

1475
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,530
yeah the curved area in regard to the
diplomatic cable specifically

1476
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:04,620
I'm ground limb here and say that might
have been indiscriminate to recall

1477
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:06,470
information having reviewed all

1478
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:09,760
at what point should we be class find
the information because

1479
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,980
the system's obviously the abuse right
now yes guidelines fracture classified

1480
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,090
information a perfect

1481
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:18,360
into intelligence was by Mina at CIA

1482
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:22,440
they don't even bother to classify the
anything because it's assumed that

1483
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,340
everything including your pizza order

1484
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:28,080
is classified it it might reveal how
many fat people you have

1485
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:32,309
up but go which is a lot are

1486
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:36,820
the bottom line here is that Rodney
mcdaniel at Harvard

1487
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:40,230
in the sixties it might have been it
might have been the 90s I forget

1488
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:44,220
he came out and said publicly and he was
the executive secretary the national

1489
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:46,630
security council he came out publicly

1490
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:50,880
and said that 90 percent a secrecy is
turf protection

1491
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,930
and it's basically covering up fraud
waste and abuse and oh by the way in the

1492
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:58,060
$75 billion a year that we're spending a
secret intelligence

1493
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:02,410
over $10 billion of that probably as
much as $15 billion if that

1494
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:05,530
is so-called classification and so forth

1495
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:08,650
now where I would go with this and I
think the judge

1496
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:12,800
that just convicted the two people that
we're supporting cuba

1497
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,240
was very ignorant because when you get
to

1498
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:20,610
blanket police state %uh convictions

1499
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:24,429
for leaking information that is actually
in the public interest

1500
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:29,350
you've lost touch with your society
you've lost touch with your public

1501
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:34,580
and this young man may have been
indiscriminate but I would give him the

1502
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,080
benefit of the doubt

1503
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,850
I would publicize all of those cables
and I would start firing some other

1504
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:41,660
people who wrote the

1505
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:46,420
because the fact is what they're doing
in our name is criminal

1506
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:49,750
okay and they don't think that they
think they're being really cool

1507
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:50,710
diplomats

1508
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:54,550
you know move in manipulating whatever
but the reality is most diplomats or

1509
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:55,870
messenger boys

1510
01:36:55,870 --> 01:37:01,860
and the and the the messages written by
a political appointee a 30-something

1511
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:06,190
I love who basically we're out some shoe
leather on the campaign was made a

1512
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:08,610
deputy assistant secretary of state

1513
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:11,750
as a reward I mean I get these people
beneath contempt

1514
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:16,280
up so we have a real problem and how
weak don't govern ourselves

1515
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,590
yes sir talking to you have

1516
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:24,470
actually all of your books who someone
at the DN eyes office and left them in

1517
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:25,830
his desk and I

1518
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:28,870
haven't hear them I

1519
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:33,599
that was probably it Elliott Chartis he
doesn't read

1520
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:38,030
a anyway I'll take that as a yes I am

1521
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:41,570
speaking as someone who was an
intelligent sales

1522
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:44,730
and someone who also help to write the
denies

1523
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:48,200
class K games and has reviewed the CIA's

1524
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,700
education guides an actor contractor
work for CAD

1525
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:56,020
couple comments and I'll

1526
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:59,710
one Bradley Manning complete asshole

1527
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:04,050
he said reporters any war crimes any
thought was a war crime

1528
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:07,320
to CAD to investigate because he pried

1529
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:11,870
fucked up the prosecution have any work
right that might have existed

1530
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:15,120
that's a that's a very good point are
however

1531
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:19,130
I have found in my experience that CA
doesn't really exist

1532
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:23,460
I'm scid and that most things you report
to see ID never get

1533
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:27,000
investigate like I said I was with Sadie
and

1534
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,590
every case that ever came up was
prosecuted

1535
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:35,130
in successfully I've never heard anyone
go to see I D

1536
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:38,320
with the claim there was never
investigated and prosecute

1537
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,269
I'll take your word for it but I'm
pretty sure you never got a diplomat

1538
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:42,280
fired

1539
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:47,120
true by then again but the government
you cannot fire anybody for

1540
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:51,890
incompetence they have to come in drunk
also a racial slurs

1541
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:55,610
you know rate actually it's Roger rate

1542
01:38:55,610 --> 01:38:58,830

everybody

1546
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:14,380
I think that few people have taken that
to heart as far as

1547
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:18,940
water consumption is concerned no to all
public service announcement

1548
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:22,780
smelling like a dirty nasty bastard does
not make you a better hacker

1549
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:29,719

last point

1551
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,860
yes sir in the back

1552
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,809
I want to do not get your thoughts on
the mandatory in Bellingham

1553
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:46,590
identification chips in humans and if
you still think we're heading towards

1554
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,090
like

1555
01:39:47,090 --> 01:39:50,460
you will be assimilated for

1556
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:53,800
could I'm serious %uh

1557
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:57,260
know it look I mean I love the

1558
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:00,430
the I forget what it was true lies or
whatever works

1559
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:04,510
where this guy had to dig in and pull
the chip out in whatever I mean my son

1560
01:40:04,510 --> 01:40:08,270
just put in my youngest son just put his
US passport through the washing machine

1561
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:11,780
on and of course you should put your

1562
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:15,130
they are you should put all your
passwords in the microwave arm

1563
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:20,070
but the problem we have is that the US
government

1564
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:23,880
is full of good people who are
completely out of control

1565
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:29,010
on the US government is basically trying
to micromanage shit it does not

1566
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:30,130
understand

1567
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:33,970
on and it is just

1568
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:37,000
it's it's it's lunacy on

1569
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,890
the the israelis I mean it you know as
much as I

1570
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:44,120
get annoyed by the israeli manipulating
congress

1571
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:48,420
lying and stealing and all this other
stuff there are some things they do well

1572
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:51,760
I established a requirement 1988

1573
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,980
for being able to detect explosives at
five hundred meters

1574
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:58,550
are regardless of the container they
were in because we're still stuck in

1575
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:01,580
container land which is why in El
Salvador in the eighties

1576
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:05,220
on they would put their minds in wooden
boxes

1577
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:10,600
on and I talked an Israeli official we
saw that prime years and I said what was

1578
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,750
a says it's a dog

1579
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:15,560
well he's right

1580
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:18,680
and when the israelis put people on an
airline

1581
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:23,300
they searched their luggage and a
question them and they make calls

1582
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:26,900
to the phone numbers at these
individuals are required to give a

1583
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:30,710
know who is getting on that airplane we
have something that

1584
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:34,820
tells us if your vagina has expanded
lately okay

1585
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:40,690
it's just nuts so let's let's go on
there

1586
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:43,930
in the back and I will come forward
morning sir I was curious if you did

1587
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:45,080
speak to

1588
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,580
global monetary policy the stability

1589
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:52,420
love financial situation in our country
and should I buy gold

1590
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:56,140
well you miss the you miss the gold the

1591
01:41:56,140 --> 01:42:01,140
opportunity plus I te what there's some
very strong earnings on the market that

1592
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:04,260
something's coming out that's going to
drive the price a gold way down

1593
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:07,570
because it's basically gonna discover
all the gold on the planet

1594
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:13,460
of now you know Afghanistan on the one
hand the Chinese know what they're doing

1595
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,990
they're they're building roads and
railways to be able to mine the copper

1596
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:20,830
and the other stuff that they want we're
actually invented

1597
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:23,990
minerals to justify paying their

1598
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:28,769
ten years later a the Arcade is actually

1599
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:31,990
right here down at the ward of Australia
for

1600
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:36,210
you know I mean it's just its its nots
upbeat with this market rumor maybe

1601
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:39,770
AAA I i don't want to give it too much

1602
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:44,970
credence but someone I really believe in
who follows cold very closely

1603
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:49,110
and also that's the other thing the
there's some real panic over the fact

1604
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:50,120
that the new york

1605
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:53,260
fed evidently the

1606
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:57,220
diluted a whole bunch gold and put some
titanium in the middle

1607
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:00,670
yeah tungsten thank you tungsten

1608
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:06,270
and there's also some real fear that the
chinese to play some

1609
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:09,390
puts or whatever on gold are going to
demand the physical gold

1610
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:13,590
rather than certo you know weeks and
then they're gonna test it

1611
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:17,300
okay I mean talk about having us by the
short hairs

1612
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:22,720
this is really interesting I personally
feel that we need to disassociate

1613
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:28,630
wealth from fiction on and we really
need to get back to local ownership

1614
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:34,200
eliminate absentee landlords the whole
bit just as a minor point which I made

1615
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,660
before my lecture with so you may not
have been there

1616
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:40,650
on William writer one of my favorite
writers has written a book called come

1617
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:41,530
home america

1618
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:45,179
in which he points out that arm real

1619
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:49,660
assets grew by five times in value
whereas financial assets grew by

1620
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:51,410
seventeen times in value

1621
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:55,889
slow 17 -5 12 is the fraud index for
Wall Street

1622
01:43:55,890 --> 01:44:00,940
okay I mean how we can allow these guys
to give themselves bonuses

1623
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:04,640
is only understandable in the context of

1624
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,330
the white house being a subsidiary of
Wall Street and being absolutely

1625
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:13,040
divorced from the public interest okay a
piercer

1626
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,340
said quick question regarding I as you
say leadership

1627
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:20,820
with the intelligence committees now I
have the

1628
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:25,080
fun to people I know that have worked in
the past were very various intelligence

1629
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,830
80s out there specifically are in a row
my roommate is currently

1630
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:34,600
the intern with the NSA on I know
somebody who I don't you just got fired

1631
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:38,670
okay anyway and so what's your question

1632
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:41,760
hi anyway my point was

1633
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:46,110
arm the every I actually know other
people were fast as well every person I

1634
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:47,340
know who works for the essay

1635
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:50,330
has said they're all the %ah Conway was
saying that they never one worker

1636
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:50,950
full-time

1637
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:54,460
after intensive the only way are they
are

1638
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:57,690
they are also there are I'm paranoid is

1639
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:02,090
all held to put it bluntly everybody to
the point where they actually

1640
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:05,110
the rumors are that that is a do we
think the

1641
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:09,550
on IMEI I really wouldn't be onto
skeptical them anymore after the mouth

1642
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:10,590
cover for dove

1643
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:14,350
and is a time people watch neighbor what
your coworker on what's going on

1644
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:18,450
INR oh I've heard people claim complain
just has no central leadership

1645
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:23,050
the well you know there's something
called Jim clapper scare

1646
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:27,520
on basically in the nineteen nineties
and I was I was a GM 14 with these

1647
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,290
people when they were four trains

1648
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:34,920
there were a number people like John
Dempsey and

1649
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:39,210
I forget the names but that basically a
buncha girls the gym adopted

1650
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:43,600
and now they're running the intelligence
community on his behalf

1651
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:47,000
and we just moved one very nice out
risch

1652
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,940
long just took over the NRL she took
over the entire ok because she's 10 p.m.

1653
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:53,530
Kloppers harem girls

1654
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:58,400
on and I'm not talking sexually in most
cases

1655
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,240
but in the end I specifics a list of the
last thing I read in the news about them

1656
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,040
with their budding heads with the

1657
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:08,380
director CIA over various control
various and commiserate

1658
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:12,980
well the Deni is a faster child who
should never have been built

1659
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:18,180
on I mean that and I is like 4000 staff
members and what we basically did was we

1660
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,760
promoted every asshole that should have
been retired

1661
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:24,260
one more time to the day and I staff

1662
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:29,090
on and you know there's some good people
there there's some smart people there

1663
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:32,610
but there isn't a single one of them the
could write the book that I wrote the

1664
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:33,840
2000

1665
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,720
actually wrote in the 1990s and put it
together after the Washington Post got

1666
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,000
me to tell them

1667
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,400
that I had written a book on sold 'as a
funny story washington Post calls me and

1668
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:47,370
says what your comments on these two
books I so what about my book at the

1669
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:49,640
point at that point I'm it was a binder

1670
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:53,340
with my articles but it had a really
cool title on intelligence pies in

1671
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,730
secrecy an open-world

1672
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:58,730
so they wrote about my books I decided I
better write it and go

1673
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:02,220
and I did a and it was a wonderful
inspiration

1674
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:06,450
so what kinda pointy trying to get to
other than the fact that the National

1675
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:08,090
Intelligence Community

1676
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:11,260
is the worst of all possible worlds

1677
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:16,780
it's a bureaucracy with too much money
they can hide its mistakes for secrecy

1678
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:20,950
as it was rosy what do you think is your
best your best bet on how

1679
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:25,580
to fix how would you do it differently
but I think it's gonna happen but if I

1680
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:28,580
were tea and i dont fuck that place in
ninety days

1681
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:31,710
%uh and I'd start by making the
secretaries the

1682
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:37,240
leaders have the various agencies for at
least 30 days

1683
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:40,440
you know the but no yellow up the
secretaries are honest

1684
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:43,950
and they know who is a bullshitter on
and I i

1685
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:47,599
really have enormous respect for
secretaries who basically pull their

1686
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,720
bosses alone

1687
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:54,260
and and protect their bosses also in the
back there and I will come forward here

1688
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:58,310
this is more in the spirit a PSA also
arm

1689
01:47:58,310 --> 01:48:01,720
you know a lot of people are just
leaving the trash next to their chair

1690
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:04,750
and then someone else s the common
cleanup

1691
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:09,820
and as just it's hard to respect that
because

1692
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:13,509
we have to clean up our own mess before
we start yapping away about cleaning up

1693
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:14,830
everyone else's math

1694
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:18,290
you know i mean we can even pick up the
plastic cups

1695
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:22,810
next our chairs you know who are we to
criticize

1696
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:26,520
BP were I mean thats that's on the same

1697
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:32,480
okay think

1698
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:36,620
yeah up next in the back and I will come
forward

1699
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:39,940
I'm misses a slightly different question

1700
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:43,640
what's your personal investment
philosophy

1701
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:47,070
if you had twenty thousand dollars to
invest in something

1702
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:50,580
sounds like you're down on Wall Street

1703
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:54,630
any by the you actually respect to you
take your money and do something good

1704
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:58,250
look my wife gave me thirty thousand
dollars in savings and instead of

1705
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:00,690
putting it in the Cisco in 1992

1706
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:05,980
wasted on my company I really would not
ask me for investment advice

1707
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:09,820
for up in BP is a good investment

1708
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:13,500
right now arm well but

1709
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:18,490
but again you know I'm really troubled I
think we should get rid of the stock

1710
01:49:18,490 --> 01:49:19,880
market

1711
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:24,320
I'm not at all sure its its ever going
to be honest

1712
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:28,710
and you know Mark Lewis wrote a book
called liars poker in the 1980s

1713
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:31,970
and he was recently interviewed me said
I never thought they'd get away with it

1714
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:33,630
for another 20 years

1715
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:38,590
arm but they have and now we've just
build a man i mean the the idea of the

1716
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:40,260
US government

1717
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:44,810
giving wall street a trillion dollars
and and people not burning tires in the

1718
01:49:44,810 --> 01:49:46,500
streets just confounds me

1719
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:50,090
I'm suffering from cognitive dissonance
right now her

1720
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:53,700
so I wouldn't go to me for investment
advice but i'll tell you

1721
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:58,630
if I had to do it all over again I think
all things being equal

1722
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:03,650
I morph to day on

1723
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:08,520
one-quarter inch down on the Pacific
Coast the Washington State

1724
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:12,890
and start growing marijuana

1725
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:16,440
mister

1726
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,580
yes sir I'm I'm from South Louisiana and

1727
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:23,360
I'll all those places you see on the
news i'd

1728
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,370
around flu shot

1729
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:29,590
Grand Terre all those places fission

1730
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:34,060
I am that bird's foot you see the
Mississippi River Delta

1731
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:37,300
when I was 13 and running around that
place

1732
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:41,460
there was 50 percent more land mass on
it then there is now

1733
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:44,770
we lose 25 square miles

1734
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:48,350
your that's something like a football
field every

1735
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:53,610
30 minutes while have 30 percent up the
coastal marsh

1736
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:58,820
the United States with these Nini we've
lost ninety percent of it

1737
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:02,900
the Gulf Coast is responsible for
something like fifty percent

1738
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:06,200
the shrimp harvests per year

1739
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:09,930
are coz we're I'm sorry we're booked

1740
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:14,050
I'm mime muscling I want to move back to
Louisiana

1741
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:18,930
and help make the state better these
problems existed before Katrina

1742
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:22,110
all these issues with Katrina and

1743
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:25,580
the Gulf Coast loss those are all the
fall

1744
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:28,740
the oil company before work if he did
this

1745
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:32,840
mister girl was one that the the
Mississippi River Gulf outlet was

1746
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,200
me by oil companies to increase shipping

1747
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,430
and they shut it down because it in
getting traffic in increased by fifty

1748
01:51:40,430 --> 01:51:41,080
percent

1749
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:44,570
over its lifetime and the within trying
to push this

1750
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:48,639
storm surge up into the Mill City and
destroyed it

1751
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,710
well let me take care let me take your
comment well or my

1752
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:55,230
my whole question is where do I have any

1753
01:51:55,230 --> 01:52:00,040
optimism like my state's gone we're
we're your that's welfare

1754
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:04,600
been dogged for the united states were
were done we have no coastal town me

1755
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:08,510
will NC done for us that's all we had

1756
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:12,220
so where do you have any who that we can

1757
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:17,600
corporate malfeasance has been wracking
the country for 150 years they've been

1758
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:23,840
all over you know the the order for
engineers been doing nothing answer and

1759
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,890
so where do you have hope for the future
that will fix any

1760
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:31,750
shit up for stuff is a wonderful book
called

1761
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:37,710
axo God and the point that it makes is
that paving over the wetlands was not a

1762
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,740
cool idea

1763
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:43,349
because that in fact is a major issue
I've reviewed a number of books on

1764
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:44,080
climate

1765
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:50,050
and weather change and so forth that
what it really turns out is we destroyed

1766
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:53,760
the Mississippi River Delta area

1767
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:59,130
and the Corps of Engineers has been a
major force for destruction

1768
01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:03,040
and it's all been done because nobody
thought this through

1769
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,540
and the precautionary principle was a
followed and

1770
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:10,290
and as horrible as louisiana is

1771
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:15,469
is matched easily by major problems
elsewhere

1772
01:53:15,469 --> 01:53:21,490
on because I A can't ross perot's book
catastrophe is really excellent mean

1773
01:53:21,490 --> 01:53:26,120
we do more damage with industrial
misbehavior

1774
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:30,900
then any terrorist ever could in fact in
the in the book that I just wrote

1775
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:34,690
on a really good I really admire Steve
Carmel

1776
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:39,630
the firmer chipping he told me that
basically a terrorist incident like in

1777
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:41,270
Baltimore Harbor

1778
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:44,510
is nothing more than a train wreck for
the shipping industry

1779
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:47,990
but the idiot decisions that the
government makes in the thirty days

1780
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,700
after that

1781
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:54,600
cost them billions of dollars because
the US government overreacts and

1782
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:59,170
and so forth and i was a smart enough to
think a bit on the day but 911

1783
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:03,790
would have been a lot cheaper if we had
simply said to every pilot tell your

1784
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:07,750
passengers any asshole that gets up in
the next 30 minutes is dead

1785
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:11,840
%uh and will give the Presidential Medal
to the first class passenger the kill

1786
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,580
zone

1787
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:15,940
%uh I mean

1788
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:19,320
it's just weeks weekly so overreact

1789
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:22,840
I mean TSA is is pathetic

1790
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:28,390
up and and these machines etc and taking
off my shoes from having to take off

1791
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:30,000
Mike Bell

1792
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,120
I mean I'm kate is laughing when when
when 9/11 happened I i wrote a short

1793
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,140
blog piece on how

1794
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:39,450
no we sped for every

1795
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:43,240
for every dollar that al Qaeda or anyone
else pens to fuck this up we have to

1796
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,120
spend five hundred thousand dollars in
re

1797
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,670
in return it's now up to 5 million okay

1798
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:54,219
I mean we cannot keep doing this on we
are reaching the limit over idiocy

1799
01:54:54,219 --> 01:54:58,450
%uh and II what senator
