all kama flash the flesh by Zachary EMP
device

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,440
and I measure the voltage passant able
to figure out

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,530
the energy that's because from it and on
my Kapiti energy

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,350
and also it's documented that other
people have done it wanna

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,689
center fuel tank in trying to figure out
how many millage jewels jewels

6
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:22,930
energy we need to have that center fuel

NP device in the camera are Palin jewels

8
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,340
it's one here if the arm to pass since

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,040
times %uh voltage squared talk about
power grid power quality in Tesla coil

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,070
history BNP the comp affect the H-bomb

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,660
tessick much generator explosive devices
on which is

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,860
the H-bomb last offish this is what
really started all of

00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,910
and 62 explanation Bama body miles from

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,059
why 30 string street lights went out

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,610
303 lights on a one-out and

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,839
a tribute to justice H-bomb the
traumatic pulse

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,059
the is love conflict information I've
got about

18
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,880
whether or not this really happened as
said they never developed a

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,320
have a scientific process to see

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,500
how punched him for the polls disabled
things whether really was

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,240
course but this is the history the marks
generator

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,759
I can you smoke generator in developing
all these polls event in 1924

23
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,759
novel concept create high voltage
psychotic drinks but medication errors

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,640
gives me dry mouth and and your caffeine
I can't stand

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,979
on it's not a concept Creek

26
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:48,130
voltages capacitors charge in parallel
the capacitor discharge in series

27
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,449
polls injecting that's cool I'm cell
phone cable

28
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,070
Galax network grounding strap I found my
favorite thing to use its grounds crap

29
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,259
because a crowning to trap has access to
everything everybody things where we put

30
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,219
a ground

31
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,040
and I find that it's a don't people
would actually no

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,009
never to use a grounding strap for
grounding people who didn't

33
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,110
she was work a Tesla coils because they
would know

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,440
that your frog were electronics but

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
world but nobody else would know that on

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,379
Dundas do dumb digital vices

37
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,620
some digital vice I found a news which
disc stupid calculators

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,700
to just keep on going putting any
numbers on Nov

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,060
on the you on the display no matter how
much polls and everything else

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,090
aren't they just keep on working and
you're going to see

41
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,540
samples this it also type EMP fuzzing

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,929
when you inject these pulses because my
papa's is picking up these pulses

43
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,500
as yours randomness they don't know what
to do let's

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,430
has fiske algorithm to see with an odd
this is actually garbage

45
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,940
smart devices what they do

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,859
they reboot and I'll show you likes
reporting arm

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,129
unfortunate I killed laptop that I did
have

48
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,899
I did this for the hard drive and I just
got killed it

49
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,510
but I did have a democrat I was going to
do which shows I

50
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,518
boot with Linux and it stops as an error
message

51
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,640
dude with Windows 98 start their message

52
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,800
I also had a new Acer computer which was
only like

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,090
15 months old and it needed a new
motherboard and processor

54
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,799
and also the hard drive by and the
optical device went

55
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,000
and again this is was knowledge with
that

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,030
these processes are much more sensitive
and

57
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:44,030
is an aging to them are patrolling the
number could rise as on the people sing

58
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,640
they cannot bring the network up get
Linux UNIX on Windows routers

59
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
they will not be able to rebook was low
every 18 months

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,099
the princess's doubles that can be put
on so conscious way for

61
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,090
again as you decreased die size and
decrease the voltages

62
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,849
things are becoming much was acceptable
not all

63
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,390
the dramatic poses on the same yes and
those polls

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,750
with the polls rise time to polls raid
the harmonics are generated

65
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,269
frequency I should have set up

66
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,910
a demonstration with a mocks generate as
an old tests showing that even though I

67
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,180
have

68
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,130
watchin and proposes nothing happens
because these pulses

69
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,650
are not company rice I'm and intensity
and frequency

70
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,659
that'll disturb something which by the
way I say

71
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,669
anybody you don't have my phone a man
called

72
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:40,830
anybody want to challenge me I could
show them someplace

73
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,780
and arm that a coach and is repulsive
somebody's

74
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,040
monsters I can replace his butt guys %uh
experiment

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,940
Byzantine forbes Lord real-time
distributed systems

76
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,610
what is a big Byzantine Fort problems
today

77
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,120
its the yom robotic troll airlines

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,949
and Dom poll seen one of them would just
be what up a tally to

79
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,120
disabled are both boleyn and um

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Airbus have tried to use different
operating systems on different devices

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,870
different schemas network protocols they
tried to mix a bluff so that

82
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,320
no warm the one virus could be lethal to
everything

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,009
the might pose a lethal everything

84
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:33,220
so voice control data acquisition well
these are the large-scale real-time

85
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,570
distributed systems

86
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,570
the control number of things obviously
you don't know

87
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,780
want some rejecting poses any the
system's

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,910
are as we go green with increasing
microprocessor

89
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,320
dependent provide a trained

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,919
in the new york city we have the L train
now consistently robotic

91
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,960
there is one modem and up front but
there's no conductor

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,930
and arm I think about it rains

93
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,009
arm can be basically susceptible to this
one thing that they've never I've never

94
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:07,960
done information on

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,219
the third real walking a check for
inmates

96
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,479
pulses arm I don't know presided the
frequency spectrum

97
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,240
that it's a problem words that they did
record they know what it is and they

98
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,860
filled it out

99
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,110
but again you can inject pulses into it

100
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,819
that is outside is filled range

101
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:31,970
fly-by again the bowing out for Boeing
the pilot is in control

102
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,919
a bus the computers in patrol Armin
Airbus

103
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,830
the pile can only go with us for din
range

104
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,659
about its use with the aircraft the
computers over him role

105
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,050
overruling bowling the pilot is always
in control

106
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,720
computers just there to augment

107
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,720
to the flight 800 armies

108
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,530
on there was a test and I think was
honored

109
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,729
737 main fuel technology flight

110
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,960
and it was 10 I think science magazine
size channel

111
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,349
basically they found that 75 militia was
injected into the tank

112
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,240
because it's to explode on

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,810
one thing if you did in jackie's polls
into

114
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,680
aircraft flight recorder probably would
record some artifacts

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,599
you probably see some water faxes bike
words the some ringing

116
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,280
because they'd actually be something
ringing as legal as it refers to the

117
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,770
network

118
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,659
arm and again this ringing probably they
would not on is a soldering they would

119
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,030
understand what it means

120
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,460
concern arm again power

121
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,590
capacitances I I measured the

122
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,599
to pass on this is from 10 simple
cameras you know four-week am A

123
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,430
with the stroll you throw away for ten
dollars

124
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,479
and acids was 102 Michael for our roads

125
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,400
the voltage is about three you 100 volts
puppy 4.4 jewels

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,300
energy souls well outside the range
where it could actually fuel injected

127
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,900
from the

128
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,849
scammer it could cause a center fuel
tanks Mon doesn't mean it did

129
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,909
but could

130
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,419
your friends this one went down

131
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,198
I don't want to talk too much about this
om I was waiting for them to recover the

132
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,389
your flight recorder

133
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,990
this was a robot with a 4.0

134
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,680
if somebody's robotically your friends
about the controlled planes

135
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,890
specialty and bosko start going down
words very mysteriously

136
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:39,348
arm I would say there's a good chance
somebody's injecting poses into them

137
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,360
hospitals the mic poss rich

138
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,130
they have accomplished done devices
smart devices

139
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,200
smart devices somebody always have to
reset them will try to reboot will turn

140
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,820
themselves off

141
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,120
the power grid we have three main power
grids sobered

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,320
we have these grid arm West great in the
texas great

143
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,480
we also have something out again this is
covered more mileage work on injecting

144
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,310
poses

145
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,080
into the electric are great and
infrastructure

146
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,260
and again this is something that common
security or the other people would not

147
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,779
thing cover anything else I do not think
it's coming from this table for

148
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,430
that were that you can build lies
powerful you don't need that much power

149
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,830
you really don't need as much power as
people think sir not to

150
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,130
black Queens and Brooklyn that's pretty
bed

151
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,670
oMG you need to run you posted former

152
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,430
to cause the Transformers two failed but
to bring down the

153
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,410
might cost controls good and performance

154
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,740
and they want to understand what's going
on

155
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,940
how quality arm again this is something
that can be affected by injecting poses

156
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,610
a great

157
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,779
inductance capacitance harmonics
transients

158
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,060
the gadget and talking about arm I think
you

159
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,870
to bring down the whole rate in the
United States I think you'd be in about

160
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,529
20-30 them

161
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,529
and the toll plaza about 25 35,000 miles

162
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,089
it's not really a lot of money get to be
but 60s

163
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:16,040
said they sent us while arm

164
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,569
I would probably try to use Soucy most
vets

165
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,930
and that's what I'm using on the MOX
generate and when you see the video

166
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,890
it but standby for videos a much more
interesting

167
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,500
Ando do you remember videos your members
arm

168
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,410
unfortunate you have a new could do prom
a fracture side

169
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:40,370
you and apps for your own Soucy divisive
to while

170
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,420
to this is 833 AZ back into

171
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,860
a lot people use it and its its
instructable from automated polls

172
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,579
that salsa subletter idea

173
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,050
grid stresses what stresses the electric
grid

174
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,420
high temperatures new windows viruses
because there's a Windows

175
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,640
chain cycled is a chain cycle that some
these

176
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,279
was initialed a gorgeous day everyone
Windows not everybody's up to date on

177
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,660
the Windows

178
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,279
are so quick change cycle when this new
change this

179
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,260
surprise control version hot weather

180
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,610
injecting poses integrated that's
another stressor

181
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,200
and again it's not something that they
would understand

182
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,370
are bringing their not mike Powell but I
believe 23 devices will do it

183
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,519
I didn't build it s ok well yet

184
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,500
ibogaine more information other I've
been sick for a while

185
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,769
the past two years I have been able to
build yet but I will be

186
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,290
it would build it and it's doable and

187
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,370
I mean basically you could probably take
a

188
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,790
mocks generated type device to one
Police Plaza

189
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,769
War two 106 Street in on

190
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,060
much bigger revenue which is weird NYPD
has their

191
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,570
arm forensic labs and take everything
out

192
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,180
but still what it is is that is

193
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,920
tremendously asymmetrical and that

194
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,969
for wrote a small device you can lose
low-skill

195
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,560
services causes Michael causer you're so
sensitive

196
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,560
arm again if you check into one systems

197
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:31,290
let me go to something really
fascinating interesting

198
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,430
let me do a dumb device first

199
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:41,240
nose wide the publisher

200
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,930
sound can everybody hear

201
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,730
there was enough this is a dumb devices

202
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,570
no matter how much just you'll see my
car

203
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,550
just keeps stupid number can general
instead

204
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,550
type devices pressure sensor

205
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,870
temperature sensor anything else expect

206
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,260
sued would be a dumb type device
basically

207
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,080
Analog Devices reading this and its

208
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,770
digitized the batteries run down

209
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,130
that's what you don't see and this is a
dumb lives and again that's my spot

210
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:30,130
the back

211
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:37,339
whenever I see for but

212
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,730
know the sound is

213
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,000
from the box generated posing
unfortunate one of the most generated

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,930
open power they become really really
loud degenerate directory

215
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,000
much because it's over 135 decibels

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,480
arm but I think gotta wait

217
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
fixed let me see which other one

218
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,480
me too the

219
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,069
this would be considered smart what
happens is that

220
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,600
it shuts it turns itself off mom

221
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,910
it turns itself off my troubles I keep
trying to put numbers in it

222
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:37,230
just just keep solo you can't really see
too much but the smarter devices the

223
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,990
most a much more sensitive

224
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,200
I don't officialdom the dumb thing that
I was holding a ride

225
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,880
this some holding had a greater distance
away they just

226
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,750
much more sense and course this doesn't
work too well anymore because um

227
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,910
again this is turn itself off

228
00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:00,910
and again that's the marks suppose

229
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:08,870
what happens in March generates
misfiring your polls finds miss

230
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,490
you can see it I'm gonna do very last
one which is the transformer

231
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,330
I did twice with the Sony video cam just
way too much generator by fizzled in the

232
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:39,850
video cam

233
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,720
its blog about 6m

234
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,540
but the same watchin what happened is

235
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,110
I have the Weisses have a transformative
sprouting see

236
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,080
I have basic large in 10 a so that great
in my 10

237
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,470
more problems I do have something
designed Tom

238
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,210
it will take out couple buildings I
think that I'd

239
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,280
borrow easily but only with with just a
test

240
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,569
again I'm going through and electric
wiring so but I'll show you

241
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,940
my camera is not happy on arm

242
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,480
and the mead

243
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,480
show you something out okay where

244
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,730
right now been shown you is on

245
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,910
connecting a water up to a an outlet and
pigments partners why up to one part of

246
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,630
my arm

247
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:44,340
spark gap and its plugged into a metal
eyelets and again you might

248
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,070
my parakeet over there and its connects
one side and one just want them stretch

249
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,480
that

250
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,520
these poses readily travel through any
type conductor very readily

251
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,569
I don't ground everything's

252
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,990
everything's flowing and with the tile
supplier everything

253
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:08,540
loading what happen is that on I tried
it

254
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,680
you can see it I have the video cams I
haven't left my wife

255
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,700
and you will see the numbers are
disappearing on this

256
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:21,700
so it does go to the wire no even it s
ok well everything's floating

257
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,668
by the way for anybody's interest in
robotics I want to design an EMP

258
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,880
package to go in somebody's robot for
Robert Gloria

259
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,770
I mean you don't you don't be I mean
basically taking up the South

260
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,830
asthma how big how powerful the robot is

261
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,080
you taking other songs like to talk
which we should hit in the head I do it

262
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,740
from there having a bomb working it out
and I walking out

263
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,669
is that on of fratricide okay she's
coming over

264
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:59,669
are holed up all-star ha we have the
batteries running down I should really

265
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,918
re did this but I was getting sick and
but I promise you you will see

266
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:17,740
going to the winery a bonus of batteries

267
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,520
the reason I'll take the reason she's
John

268
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,960
at the annual see has a min and then use
see the numbers period is going

269
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,960
so again this post is going through the
wiring and now my dogs walking

270
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:44,299
my dogs on like this actually but my
dogs is noise like they come home

271
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:50,039
be seen that this is going

272
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,779
again readily conducts

273
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:57,820
large again you do not need a really big

274
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,020
device you really need and this is

275
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,929
knowledge or something else

276
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,880
okay let's show them

277
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,880
the show the marks generator me do a
work through that

278
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:25,530
out

279
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,940
here's him

280
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,060
and i'd to basically do what for

281
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,389
and unable to do it outside outside so
looks even better

282
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,680
each orange thing is a capacitor

283
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,470
and you see those the resistors that are
basically reason why I have

284
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,780
some side together is that on are

285
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,930
you can go to compose pretty rapidly so
you see the

286
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,650
the capacitors they chargin parallel

287
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,300
and ended his choices these very thin
Weiss you that all the hard to see

288
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,520
the Roman in series and then pointed us
to was there

289
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,520
and I'm gonna show another

290
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,070
other components Salaam people feel left
out

291
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,350
summer show the other compounds that
they need this is basically chicked

292
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,360
tester from ball is a spark gap which

293
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:30,360
you've already seen

294
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,880
the integrated circuit well I have two
World

295
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,210
analog meters to see with my you but
emblem

296
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,690
what's happening my circuit I can use
digital music was I'll bring a

297
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,020
that's a 555 timer again 555 timer

298
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,270
all the incident and that is %uh

299
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,540
basis and the polls to polls my a
moshpit

300
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:07,540
this is like a top power transistor this
most media and

301
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:12,970
gets pretty hot and also have a clamping
circuit there to a source nothing

302
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:19,460
circuit that's a flyback

303
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,590
that's a flyback transformer Ohio power
transfer 502 transformer for Catherine

304
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:24,909
to

305
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:31,910
itself a transformer for a cathode ray
tube guitar

306
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:40,520
it's a arm titled a transformer and I
think show another arm

307
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,050
more marks generator so again

308
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,290
the orange passes and the views or the
actual mocks generated koresh or else

309
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,980
is the charging circuit for and
Skywalker this is another

310
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,000
box generator WEA the polls

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,600
is contained within the spike

312
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,850
arm because what happens is that these
consumers lower

313
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,620
and they get those set of motion some

314
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,170
though he senses that attach to window
panes broken window panes

315
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,640
so they could set off some ice long
inadvertently

316
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,820
until you cut power to the alarm

317
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,850
lovely homes have a battery-powered to
actually

318
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,190
another they've still go out because um
but still die

319
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,860
okay let me show something else

320
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:39,510
let me show a surge protector this is in
my basement and I have

321
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,559
the wire from my spar cap

322
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,550
connected to the ground in Lagos surge
protector it doesn't really matter what

323
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,090
surge protectors i me

324
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,350
won a Brit 23

325
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,390
no

326
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,620
up such pics that employed in because if
I plugged it in

327
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,990
at Richmond pollsters into mileage
wiring system

328
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,010
and choosing are

329
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,050
yep a generator will work to a regular
well

330
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,690
that's a surge protector and you see the
numbers this is done device

331
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:22,690
the surge protectors were not dissolving

332
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,100
for malicious pulses look from

333
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,260
mullis's malicious electromagnetic
interference

334
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,040
and they can't really protect the
devices somebody's going to inject

335
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,740
a malicious polls into them but I knew I
would have a question what about my

336
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,480
search blacks

337
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,480
have that there show something else

338
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,980
here

339
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
now when doing his little different I
still have it

340
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,310
connected to my surge protector and I
have a wire a black wire plugged into a

341
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,159
surge protector

342
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,230
and you can see a yellow wire loose

343
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,630
leave wrapped around it and them yellow
wire

344
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,330
has allocated clips both ends and what
you can see is that

345
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,240
what's up I'll sing on reducing the rate
even tougher

346
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,740
polls into the yellow wire that
calculate its on its gonna feel the

347
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,670
pulse in the numbers

348
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,220
disappear summer numbers this is very

349
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,820
it anyway but his one true that when you
check these pulses

350
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,600
injecting your radiating into free space

351
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,130
and a little bigger you and Hannah like
you weren't as in-house

352
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,740
the bigger the radiation area an agency
that saddam

353
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,200
and have to reach over writer Online's

354
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,720
plugged into their so in this initial
radiation which was an excerpt that

355
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,310
that Tom that I read to you earlier
about radiation

356
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:22,310
the conducted polls also rate fortune
working by myself so I gotta reach over

357
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,080
that

358
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,080
ha

359
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,330
you see some the numbers have
disappeared and again this is the name

360
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,110
example the radiation that would cause
it's more over an issue

361
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,990
if you start to do a whole how great
because the public becomes your

362
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:54,990
antenna I mean do

363
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:06,049
another one and we do the

364
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:09,309
the camera which is funny

365
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,529
post vice took apart

366
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:18,070
one of these on cameras and

367
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,879
basically the capacitance and

368
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,460
has a little transform in there which
his arm

369
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,480
so by that the capacitor which I measure
the voltage and

370
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,490
Sony measured of 1/2 jewels

371
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,299
to this woman enough to use certainly
sort of the are sent fuel tankers to get

372
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:38,639
very

373
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:44,549
800

374
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:51,549
down outside with I'm charging it up and
no one is sure to show the voltage

375
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:09,510
I almost killed 23 injured spot on ruled
as pop

376
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,809
terms

377
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:31,809
no exam does give a pool

378
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,160
no no no using the device

379
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,160
in the flesh part the flesh that the
charges up

380
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,450
pass which discharges to work light
floodlight transform into the strolled

381
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,480
instead I was just discharging it as an
awk

382
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,810
getting off by Sean terms and shown that
this is a post but I measured the polls

383
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,350
and stuff

384
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,470
wanna have jewels and when they measured
the amount of energy they needed to

385
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,910
ourselves that center fuel tank are

386
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,910
it was about 75 militia 75,000 so

387
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,060
I mean use quarter quite effective
device there

388
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,740
arm me do this is Michael want me to
which I killed

389
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,510
this was this was

390
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,610
just on my table and

391
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,730
its the other media 126

392
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,020
incorrect voltage and lettering 200 12
in goals

393
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,350
and again

394
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,950
I just try different things and what
also happens that

395
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,470
if the wifi some things and how stopped
working but but

396
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,930
know by a so I was really upset about
that but for the motherboard to go

397
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,010
and then the hard drive and then the the
arm

398
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:57,010
the optical reader not too much interest

399
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,580
yes I do have something other next one i
think is less but i think thats

400
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:10,210
probably one of the more interesting
ones for me Sergio

401
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:17,210
does

402
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,120
that's the last one and that's what show

403
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,350
and this is the one where you will see

404
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,370
the Sony video cam lose focus

405
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,799
and I did it twice and 10 looked at the

406
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,190
I realize there was anything my wife did
that was because the on

407
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,880
that is a arm

408
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,230
transformer I haven't won so I love it I
have why go into this calculator

409
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,580
bill that actually sued died and they
will die

410
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:00,580
mean I don't know a howl soon they'll
die but they do dogs let me

411
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:08,850
stop us one second to stop you probably
missed it but

412
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,419
two-minute I start the March generating
it to sound

413
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:17,080
because our focus and again this happens

414
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,460
this was on the two takes I did this
twice and happened both times

415
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:27,830
when out-of-focus the many these

416
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:34,830
the sound you'll see it go our focus

417
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:47,400
and she has it on the the side ha

418
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,440
again this is through the transformed
France was still good

419
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,760
because I'd into the studio and that I
should do continuity test

420
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,760
here too

421
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,930
my wife is not very good systems

422
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:23,030
who else know basically so you have a
farmer in saying it doesn't matter where

423
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,230
you come from a secular

424
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:31,230
these pulses rarely go transforms again
if anybody wants to like or me on any

425
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:33,800
they've

426
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,820
mation you in a New York City area when
we demonstrated I have no problems

427
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,580
but

428
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:49,580
yeah

429
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,400
no i i don't think it's

430
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,830
now now yes

431
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:06,830
yep no your i'd but I don't think it's
yeah

432
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,909
ha

433
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:27,220
mmm

434
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,860
I think so

435
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,980
I think so arm

436
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,860
let me show no I I think readily they
can be taken down

437
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,940
you cannot really

438
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,220
again when you injected for the wiring
as possible that injected through the

439
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,000
ground

440
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,559
I don't think you have to think you have
to you just be a two-seat

441
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,480
any power plug what I think if you enjoy
superstructure

442
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,490
the thing I think you cause problems
that

443
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:06,000
yes external sources they've been hit by
lightning

444
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,299
they've got to rate radar feels these or
external sources

445
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:14,259
and the body acts as a Faraday shield
and it from surrounded

446
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:21,259
23

447
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,320
well while I don't know about that but I

448
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,620
you you don't wanna you without you
would not want to fly an Airbus because

449
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:35,970
I've

450
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,600
the ER just has arm I have something out

451
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,780
would

452
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,168
anybody I have something else that might
be an interesting video that shows

453
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:50,350
a fabric which I have here and a Geiger
counter

454
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,480
an x-ray source or gamma resource would
anybody like see that

455
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,780
there was another talk there's gonna
give but I just

456
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,780
got 260 and I had by the way

457
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,270
won the fabrics here they could feel and
by the way you can obtain also those

458
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,090
fabrics from

459
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:14,159
I'll but cycle less EMF because people
who are very concerned about

460
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,210
wifi one man's WiFi signals all men's
pollution

461
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,340
and we really have a set rates Saudi arm

462
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,280
I'm probably gonna do a talk on that Def
Con next year which I was going to do

463
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,820
that but

464
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:31,099
I got and is too sick to travel got a
lot purposes

465
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:34,639
while because I am would

466
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,639
its he I know it's here I don't you here
it is here it is

467
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:48,859
here's airport apps

468
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,639
it's here it's here

469
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,240
no rod

470
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,590
see

471
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:14,590
thats accountancy degree Megan

472
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,630
robust sensor as possible the X-rays
that you have on the high side

473
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,580
soft x-ray hope they don't country skin
the council

474
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:34,580
ha and this is the

475
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,400
fabric that while the first family I
tested so I have no problem with people

476
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,400
killed what

477
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,030
home to more testing the

478
00:35:53,030 --> 00:36:00,030
so probably have comparable excuse me

479
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,340
arm if you created some new clothes out
of it

480
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,430
it would show you happen one of the
vendors

481
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,629
cool won the bar body scanners are

482
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,800
wrapped a Beretta pistol a brother

483
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,280
are nine-millimeter pistol in a fabric
that look like this

484
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,660
buddy rapid showed clearly see the
outline you know clearly was a pistol

485
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,470
but not without wrapping up to crane
clothing and this is what's meant it's

486
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:34,750
free

487
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,260
holding up this if anybody is interested
in

488
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,880
robots by creating I DM in peace package
for the robot

489
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,460
water interested in looking at something
about these fabrics

490
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,180
war on is those a copper farmers

491
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,460
ha by the way

492
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,010
when you got on a plane at thirty
thousand you getting more than

493
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,410
a gamma ray exposure warplanes then you
will to any these are

494
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,870
scanners airport scanners as a matter
fact Tom

495
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,109
if you have dust Simona with a long da
Summa

496
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,630
measures now tax raising its closer with
the law most them will have a lawn

497
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,100
if you go up on a plane at thirty forty
thousand feet the law move all the way

498
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,740
of

499
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:28,740
goal of you are bored again if

500
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:39,629
anybody's interest in helping me out
special well

501
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,780
and I you know about two columns my
actual

502
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,150
this is actually my ok my own

503
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:53,960
myself

504
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,960
yeah

505
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:10,619
even

506
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:17,619
even if the power of those will be
affected

507
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,790
arm I'm not sure blip

508
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:26,970
I found that if I have by Marx generator
post an extremely high rate

509
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,280
the fairly sure doesn't work

510
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,650
and I'm not sure if its images if
anybody

511
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,790
took physics littman them dynamics

512
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,640
if images what them charging up found
showed itself

513
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,890
and that choice again rap leaking of

514
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,230
and that screen impulse that's on that
sort of

515
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,360
nobody had ever seen explanation maybe
know what he's done work

516
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,630
that for in the field figures charge

517
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,900
I mean every physics and engineering
student learns of the very few

518
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,500
subject electronics and now I see
something that

519
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,960
maybe something else happens when you go
to very high field

520
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,880
changes the second derivative voltage
versus time

521
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,700
when that becomes very very hard I
something else happens because other

522
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,170
anyway I new to this

523
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,840
you really have seen what happens

524
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,570
his fabric and its source

525
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,470
and and this caused

526
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:34,580
and you know anybody has questions take
a percocet

527
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:41,580
because I have a great deal paying I am

528
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,530
no arm arm

529
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:52,530
its

530
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,900
I think that's one at the fabric sets
you finalists EMF

531
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:06,900
website not relief that would probably
work great for the arm

532
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:15,030
for the arm the scanner

533
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:22,030
the airport scans actually something I'm
sorry

534
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,400
you have physical sample like I'm a
physical sample the first

535
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,400
fabric the a frappe okay showed

536
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:46,630
I can't believe this

537
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,200
of

538
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,690
I don't think get to directional I might
be able to shield some things with

539
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,960
reflector but I think I would still 180
degrees on

540
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,580
direction on it would have dangerous in
a sense

541
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,710
injecting the polls is into

542
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,500
think you don't know what's going to
happen afford to go to trial and your

543
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,110
solution to this if anybody has a
pacemaker in the household

544
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:32,110
shouldn't play with us

545
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:41,810
thank you

546
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:47,730
no

547
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:54,730
yes

548
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:09,009
yes yes

549
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:25,700
now

550
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,290
yes

551
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:33,290
is no protection

552
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:40,660
and the grittier you kiss the ground
wire but the polls

553
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:48,570
going up to the electronics it's going
straight in your

554
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:53,560
yes

555
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,740
yes yes I believe I believe so you when
I read an excerpt

556
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,570
that that paragraph is for be very
nebulous about what they're talking

557
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,730
about disturbances

558
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,760
I believe they've done a little research
with it idly also take down the power

559
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,510
grid with it

560
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:12,020
the russians and we don't have anything
that

561
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,180
most work with EMP is

562
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,669
to hydrogen bomb on mature cells like
that

563
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,510
arm so I believe that %uh there's a lot
more

564
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,990
that's coming the richest let me explain
something to con Edison

565
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:31,160
Khan and thus an arm and it's a little
different than a power companies con

566
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,089
Edison has

567
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:37,119
basically or step their generators they
have three wires

568
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,640
with 3-wire 3fe system and what they do

569
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,589
is when the locally distributed three
wise go to transform a delta transformer

570
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:50,810
and the other side transfers why
transform and the center point is that

571
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,520
wise ground that's the grounds

572
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,880
so basically which again that part of my
talk on

573
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,530
the electric grid basically doesn't
matter where you

574
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,030
port that polls it's going into the grid

575
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:09,960
I'm sorry

576
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,020
lighting is single polls lightning is a
single

577
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,700
polls were on the grid expect a couple
pose maybe nearby

578
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,580
on talking about many pulses again I
said that the semiconductors they do

579
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,150
have a learning they do have

580
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,770
history to them that the more you do it
so you do for smaller pulses

581
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:32,250
heading up so that's what a model poses
its I guess it's a little nebulous about

582
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:32,500
us

583
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,530
police a model poses somebody's devour
awake I mister I missed

584
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,750
I miss the video my god Jesus Christ

585
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,960
up be back in and mister

586
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,730
miss to good this is really good

587
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:53,730
really him

588
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:58,250
okay I miss them

589
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:05,250
again owners appear

590
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:10,899
again don't want to sort the cod

591
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:16,110
when you taking too many purposes
disagree

592
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:20,750
this is gonna show him I got his gun
show a a cable box

593
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:26,410
and what have this why going up and

594
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:29,930
much his name is speaking when you start
seeing the static on the screen

595
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,330
that that no you don't see yet we saw it
in a static long since been omitted

596
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:38,250
I turn on the are they are turned on the
Yum mock tonight

597
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,450
now that's fine that's gonna eventually
lose time they try to reboot

598
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,540
so tomlin 14 and

599
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,220
just about it trying to reboot can
reboot of the network because um

600
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,290
the longer I keep that up it's just
gonna do that

601
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:00,779
even those I mean if I knew you

602
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,870
up for what I would've taken out man had
an island I mean

603
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:08,279
and Annie and you know it's not that
much to take out the grid

604
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,430
lots less anyway I I did that only so I
don't own the cable box cable company

605
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,190
does but the other problem

606
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:17,550
the other the other promise that might
Mike my doing it

607
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,890
arm shutting down the lifetime with it
works for me do it again

608
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:24,819
began this is an issue that I said smart
devices

609
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,660
turn themselves off try to reboot what
they need something manual reset

610
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,520
again arm I need to do some more smart
devices because usually a

611
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,650
I'll what happens I muted

612
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:44,650
that's why but it's having a hard time
already

613
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,720
and this is just but that's a metal box
the cable box is another box I have that

614
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,970
why resting upon again the Faraday
shield

615
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:58,620
arm again if I crank up in other words
the second derivative

616
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,160
voltage first time is really really up
there the Faraday sure doesn't seem to

617
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,690
help you

618
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,590
are

619
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,860
should be put up between thirty to fifty
thousand miles it's not

620
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,390
done a bigger not a bigger arm I'm tell
you

621
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,220
it's not human test because it's not a
big device you talking about

622
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,010
i'm talking about something that fit
into a van easily

623
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,710
arm again I don't think this is
something home on security

624
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,020
concedes over if you tell any fit I was
first to make

625
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,030
but only physical a to engineering major
that fairly sure does not shield

626
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:43,030
electronics all the time they take this
is impossible I'm site yeah

627
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:50,710
I gotta make quite a I'm working on it
but I'm working on a Tesla coil my

628
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,129
because thats

629
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:56,580
is more the big energy device I can do
real time I mean it's good

630
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:01,980
real time put on the airport or JFK
Airport or Manhattan I mean really it

631
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,600
you know from what I measures II
actually it's more like aside from the

632
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,870
russians what I read their

633
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,279
why hasn't anybody else done as well a
businesses alike

634
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,740
also like wise 27 discovers

635
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:22,740
that

636
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,250
inside the plane you have to be inside
by the planes are well

637
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:34,350
arm there well grounded well connected
in that

638
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,080
an external polls is not going to do
anything they do a lot it s

639
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,180
nasa does a lot of arm spent a lot of
money very bright people

640
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,430
arm than nothing and just have a pulse

641
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:48,569
thats typeof power poles and again

642
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:51,890
if you continually do it again this is
the important

643
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:56,000
continual polls like you saw on this
cable box

644
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,030
the pulses were continuing it's for
everybody can reboot

645
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,260
is trying to reboot you can reboot

646
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,780
dough is why I stopped is because almost
as an impulse is

647
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,430
to the cable are for the cable
subscribers themselves

648
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:14,690
and although people have the music
people have had to suppose that Oct over

649
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,740
into the electric grid and they've
always the

650
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:21,250
you to easily said well this is ball
lightning strangely they've never been

651
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,140
they've never realize that something
like this happened and naturally if this

652
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,810
happens to you

653
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,940
and this is from prague come

654
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,230
private arm communication I get from
people you look in a minute because the

655
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,080
met I mean you can have the large
company come after you a cable company

656
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:45,080
I'm sorry yes basically you creating a
lot of harmonics

657
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:52,480
and I don't have a spectrum analyzer

658
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,930
arm although if I did I have to find a
way to use it without burning it now

659
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,990
first that that's that's a that's that's
a profit from that I have

660
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,330
but you really want on that very
harmonica rich

661
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:08,850
you want extremely high rise time yes

662
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:15,850
that does a PVC pipe

663
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,470
and and the spots were in the pipe
itself

664
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:26,470
that was to make it look whiter

665
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:35,020
it would be it depends upon really how
face i charge it

666
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,020
help festered discharge it that passes I
use

667
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,240
arm are

668
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,190
this the March generators release killer
well to use it as a weapon

669
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,569
I mean a big-time weapon but it s ok
well to scale up well

670
00:50:49,569 --> 00:50:53,900
to use as a type device that you could
bring down a power grid for a number of

671
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,829
weeks or months

672
00:50:54,829 --> 00:51:01,829
site your

673
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:09,180
yes yes yes yes X-rays

674
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:14,099
yes exactly you are doing that as well
fact I have a

675
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:18,770
detective that I did use in that it
would at first I thought it was the arm

676
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:22,259
electronics in the the the to some other
time

677
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,720
was been arm pulsed

678
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,690
but when I put over that she'll have fun
but I realize it was actually the X-rays

679
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,480
it was Dec six yes

680
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,839
yeah now

681
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:42,009
arm again the MOX generated does not
scale up

682
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:46,119
as well one we I'm so I'll take it was
one reason is cuz that ed

683
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:50,060
dielectric strength the air will break
down she have to go for tasseled

684
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,279
if you want something to to industrial
strength

685
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,720
like in the hundreds of billions of
dollars with the damage

686
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Trina you gotta go with Tesla coil I'm
sorry

687
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,290
I don't know because I have my own
limited funds and he's my funds for this

688
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:15,308
so I haven't really tested all the
ramifications Ovid

689
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:18,500
arm of

690
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,000
I have always been surprised on the side
that

691
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,780
this is more destructive than I could
have thought and again

692
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,150
those soviet peoples the russians that
sex or that

693
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,400
articles for 2005 so they either for
five years

694
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,329
play with a four-lap so they must learn
a lot of things and I probably learned

695
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:37,930
how to

696
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:43,020
basically bring in other countries which
grid down let me a small countries which

697
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,680
could down

698
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,410
I don't think they want to release the
typeof information to everybody because

699
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:52,520
they had on infrastructure they have to
worry about I'm this is more like if

700
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,900
a sieve Peru Argentina want to bring
Brazil down

701
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,829
this is more than economic type again
it's not something that you know we have

702
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:01,180
common bureaucracy

703
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,400
that they would be able to pick up on
the stand or inconceivable as a

704
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,119
a device even though it's extremely
asymmetrical another word

705
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,440
you create a lot of damage for very
little money and your hard to detect

706
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,440
if I starting in checking pulses into
the large grid

707
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,730
between pulses on the stopping things
down and the next stop will you bring a

708
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:22,599
great backup

709
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,490
but you may not realize what happened to
you may think that it was hit by

710
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,160
lightning

711
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,049
this is not a problem that they
understood

712
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:33,530
war aware of was almost like a
two-minute

713
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:38,040
first virus we see things im one
tell-tale something is that

714
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,880
if you have a while a box running
Windows you have a box went Sun

715
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,380
or box running Linux and they all down
together then

716
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:52,380
its so probably in people's I don't
think so

717
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,549
I thought about I don't think so i think
i be hard to track because you don't

718
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:59,630
have to continue opposing you can just
stop

719
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:03,130
they would have to find out what's going
on initially and

720
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:07,680
again the time people were I'm test
because I talked over

721
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,020
into the the grid were into the cable

722
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,290
system they figure that is something
strange

723
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,690
like being a ball lightning some strange
phenomena

724
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:22,839
some man-made phenomena and as I said
somebody who had that happens

725
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:29,839
the legacy well was you don't like world
this they did that through one free

726
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:34,420
space I don't think um

727
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,549
what was emotional in the city did in
the EMP polls

728
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:45,549
on AIM kissing arm

729
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,559
with them so far made for movie
made-for-t_v_ thing

730
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:53,020
you can really use it and then generate
in free space cuz it

731
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,440
it falls off to rapidly are you have
injected to wiring system

732
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,369
and again you could use you build mocks
generated much more powerful than this

733
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:01,809
one

734
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:06,150
whether you are the man you have an
upper limit other thing is that

735
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,690
if I say that the polls it depends on
the time you post something

736
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,160
saw your post on the net follicle 5 100

737
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,930
thousand volts and then it goes right
out in the polls

738
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:20,589
50,000 most people so for a couple the
last seconds or minutes

739
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:25,109
arm you can beef more destructive with
50,000 more

740
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:28,869
again it's a number polls and that's
important thing that one

741
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:35,869
great the people's butts numb pulses so

742
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:47,560
you

743
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,150
om

744
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:53,120
I'm working on a no really I'm working
on on my counter

745
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,460
means to a bottom as I said this is not
real

746
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:01,130
I'm sure the soviets take this very
seriously because they had a long time

747
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:05,620
they were very nebulous or vague that
disturbances agency what they did or

748
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,540
anything else

749
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,680
so and they must have found

750
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,470
a lot of things they must find hey my
god this is fantastic this is like

751
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:18,740
a new title attack thing that our taxes
us know about

752
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,410
so that's why I really think this
reference there

753
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,180
and you take my cards again email me and
I'm I'll give you

754
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,200
whatever princes you need and

755
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,590
if you want me to come down to place any
Dudamel for you guys

756
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:38,990
back

757
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,140
this 1 this is what the fabrics had to
feel how it feels
