1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,060
thing project in Springfield Illinois
%ah

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,300
he was blinded by an incident to police
violence

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,700
when cue as thin as early twenties I
think and

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,950
%ah for he was gonna start a newspaper
for the housing project that he loved

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,800
and but

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,880
but said you know first ball you know i
cant

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,939
fee you know and i cant like do this
whole printing press or thing

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,509
while we start a radio station and
people like

9
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:31,339
start a radio station you need a license
for that that's impossible

10
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,210
is like well both let's see what happens
let's see if that what happens if they

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,219
just come and get me

12
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,670
om and so heap somewhere he got this one
lakh transmitter and star this little

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,309
pirate station in his housing project he
ran for about three years

14
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:50,440
without incident you know just people
like around the block they would he run

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,870
you know no what was going on with that
but then

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,510
on now three years into it iight

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,149
one of his friends got beaten up by the
police and and bon actually went to

18
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,190
hospital and in

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,100
interview with him and then within like
a day or two

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,550
like everyone had heard these interviews
and a check that out and and there are

21
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,950
protests on the streets

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,020
and and within like 45 days the FCC came
knocking on the door and said

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,610
you don't have a license for that radio
station you're interfering with

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,470
airplanes

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,020
and %ah and what can talk a dead

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,979
very very shrewd move he went down to
the Federal Building

27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,040
he said he rightly called the present
said Here I am

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,820
put the handcuffs on me I would love to
see the proof

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,310
about all this interference by one what
radio station is causing

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,920
on and yes the scene never dared to
touch him

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,070
for up for many many years after that

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,310
and so people wait a second this guy's
operating a pirate radio station and the

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,010
FCC

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,380
is not shutting him down and so then
next you notes

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,990
people around the country starts take
notice there is a peace activist and

36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,720
in Berkeley Stephen donifer star
broadcasting with even more power

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,000
guess is he tried to shut him down and
and a judge

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,889
actually refused to grant yet to see an
injunction against this

39
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,430
I radio operation and so after that the
floodgates kinda opened and everyone was

40
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,970
like wait a second the SEC's

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,510
they you know there's rules against this
but their non-enforcement

42
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,989
my cat even a judge said that they can't
enforce these rules and

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,700
so my grip it was good pub radium uni

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,750
up we started in 1996

45
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,690
not about that ever been on the radio
none of us knew anything about radio

46
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,670
we were like teaching ourselves to like
solder and stop makeup on my bangs all

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,900
kept in their work

48
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,080
don't blow up in our faces and Mike you
know it all in our

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,520
but finally got the station on the air
and with them

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,460
a few months we had by eighty DJ's on
seven nights a week and we were

51
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,050
a community radio station and it was a
great intersection

52
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,890
all the social movements that we
supported that had so much trouble

53
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,350
getting their messages out through the
media but like every time we would like

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,810
go with our signs to the corner and it
said

55
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,420
don't do that stop that now on you know
we'll get

56
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,209
ignored and and we start to figure out
oh well it's because the same

57
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,310
corporations that

58
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,980
are these giant military contractors
that were protesting are the ones that

59
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,040
on the media to

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,269
and so the pirate station was like

61
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,670
like this kinda awesome project that
brought together

62
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,230
all of the strands up you know the
progressive movement that we supported

63
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,740
also lotsa artists and local musicians
om

64
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,740
you know and so there was all kinds of
music on there that you just when he are

65
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,450
there was like the klezmer

66
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,280
surf music you know show when the Native
American hip-hop show and

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,950
so just this really awesome awesome fun
project finally the judge

68
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,209
gay permission to you %ah to to bust
Stephen donifer in Berkeley

69
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,450
and there was this giant wave shutdowns
in 1998

70
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,700
but what was weird and what we were not
expecting it all was that the new

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,300
chairman of the FCC

72
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,560
he was the first african-american
chairman of the FCC and he had these big

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,000
dreams like I'm gonna become the
chairman of the FCC

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,860
and I'm gonna straighten out this
terrible situation with minority

75
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,470
ownership

76
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,550
where like like you know minorities are
like

77
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,130
33 percent of the population United
States may own like 6 percent a

78
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,019
broadcast licenses

79
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,358
and instead he sought go down during his
term because he was

80
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,539
ordered by Congress to allow this
massive consolidation that allowed

81
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:27,590
hundreds and hundreds of stations like
small town stations and

82
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,509
cities stations to get caught up and you
know he actually

83
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,710
looked at Austin is like these are some
really weird people

84
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,808
but they kinda have a point about

85
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:41,379
who owns the airwaves and so he %ah

86
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,849
he opened up this while making and he
start the process of legalizing

87
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,699
umpire radio stations and I he said I'm
not gonna

88
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,689
legalize all Obama I'm you now but if
someone wants to apply and get a license

89
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:58,680
you know we're gonna make away before I
leave office that they can do that

90
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,199
and so on it was around that time that
they get kicked down the door

91
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,370
brady a mutiny in common confiscated all
in

92
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,580
I can didn't have anything else to do so
I started the permit the Israel Project

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,639
which was

94
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,699
a group that was designed to hold the
FCC accountable to their promises about

95
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,699
opening up the airwaves the people

96
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,509
and I and so we've like I know you like

97
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,729
raise money for engineering studies and
get all this art thing

98
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,370
and accommodated in 2000 with actually
the FCC

99
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,559
did I open up a new round of radio
licenses their

100
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:36,830
100 Watts om they are available to
non-commercial organizations

101
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,979
and sell on does super excited %ah

102
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,479
it was kinda sucky cuz I mean my life
went from Mike

103
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,599
I patches and parrots and swords and all
that to

104
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:51,259
bike okay this is how you fill out the
form 318 and what you put under the

105
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,210
parties the application so

106
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,609
became a lot more people work but it was
also really exciting because

107
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,589
you know when we're all pirates it was
like one subset of people

108
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:04,710
that would do it and they're great
people they're really fun

109
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,770
like they're all like really reckless
and and fun

110
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,049
but on the other hand like it was just
not you know once we start having my

111
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,210
sense is that people could apply for all
suddenly

112
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,419
could what we were working with farmers
unions and environmental groups and Mike

113
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,188
just like away wider cross-section of
people and I kinda realize that we're

114
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:25,240
that the community radio should not just
be for

115
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,809
the rack loss although reckless people
are a lot of fun

116
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:32,300
on it to be pressured I mean there is
belong to all about them

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,490
and we should be like it should just be
an expectation in adopting democracy

118
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,119
that like all kinds of people

119
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:40,300
will have voices over the airwaves so um

120
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,710
so yeah you know we start filling out
these applications and then

121
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,210
I'm Maggie gets to tell the for around
par

122
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,770
affect adds another existed 2002 so

123
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,960
on and keep mentioning having a round of
applications so

124
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,089
I'm if you want to get away since like
to drive a car

125
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,619
on you can generally go in whenever you
want and you say I'm ready to take my

126
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:03,020
drivers license and you

127
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,020
take a casting you get your license I'm
the FTC didn't want to do that because

128
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,909
it would be

129
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,520
a lot of overhead for them to process
rolling applications so

130
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,469
I'm what they do instead is they say
we're gonna have windows when you can

131
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,419
apply for licenses and the windows are

132
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,210
pretty sure it like shortest five days
long on

133
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,699
food for this first round of low power
FM

134
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,270
they said we're gonna have five Windows
and depending on where in the country

135
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,008
only if you get a particular identify

136
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:34,080
I'm and you send in your application and
if you missed the window

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,159
day you miss your opportunity I'm

138
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,919
so the first went to happen not the
great people applied coming to a close

139
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,589
second window have been same deal let's
battle can stay closed

140
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,809
on and then around that time a lot of
the big broadcasters started talking to

141
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:49,520
congress

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,479
so on the bigger broadcasters were
talking about how they were worried

143
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,248
about

144
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:59,389
interference from the low-power stations
on this is kinda funny because the

145
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,689
low-power stations were

146
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,800
100 Watts time 200 what is like

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,020
the headlights on your car on the big
stations were up to 100 kilowatts which

148
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,330
is

149
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,289
about like the engine on your car on so
if you think given in terms as worrying

150
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,099
that your headlights are going to
interfere with your engine it doesn't

151
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,569
actually make a lot of sense

152
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:21,330
on so we all know that that's probably
not actually a problem

153
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,609
on the FTC no it wasn't a problem for
there when they've done this in the

154
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,509
first place

155
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,389
on the big broadcasters going to the
case they were smart on

156
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:34,079
but for some reason they didn't want the
low-power stations on possibly because

157
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,979
they were worried that if someone played
good content people would stop listening

158
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:37,759
to them

159
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,990
so on they said well for

160
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,579
who can be convinced that this is a
problem we could probably convince

161
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:45,540
congress because they really gullible

162
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,130
I'm and Congress can tell the SEC what
to do so this is perfect

163
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,019
on so the way they went about it was to
make up

164
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,660
this CD on with samples of what

165
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,689
their radio stations would sound like
with a lot of interference

166
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,240
on and since there wasn't actual
interference to document on

167
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,529
date just made something up so they took
I'm a couple radio programs and mix them

168
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,240
together and a mixer and said this is
what it's going to sound like doesn't

169
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,319
this sound terrible simply stop it

170
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,560
on and their the FCC caught on to that

171
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,350
on and they said close 50 demonstration
is misleading and is simply wrong

172
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,240
on but congress fell for it so

173
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,690
congressman ahead and I did a couple
things one thing

174
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,290
was to change the way the day II

175
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,930
book power stations are allocated which
I'll get back to you in a second

176
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,139
and the other was to tell the FCC

177
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,040
if they needed to do a study to
investigate this more before they could

178
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,920
make for their oath

179
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,509
so

180
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:52,079
up for the first fire and this is a
little diagram above

181
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,870
a section of the FM band so imagine that
you wanna put a radio station at

182
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,389
990 1.3 on if someone else is that
ninety 1.3

183
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:04,180
there's a lot of potential to interfere
so you can't do that if there's anyone

184
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,190
out with and Mike

185
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,230
100 kilometers or so on your station I'm

186
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,370
but you can also interfere with people
who are close to you so

187
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,379
if there's someone close to you on
either the first to Jason channel said

188
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:15,860
Oh

189
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,000
ninety one point winer 91.5 been you
also can't play station there

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,190
same with the second adjacent channels
on so Congress said what you throw in 30

191
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,579
days and cannot stay

192
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:29,379
which is kinda funny because the big
stations don't have to worry about 30

193
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,579
Jason channels even though they're the
ones who make more interference but the

194
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,089
little stations give

195
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,449
on so that meant that lots and the
people who had already applied for

196
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,360
licenses

197
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
on couldn't get their licenses anymore
but hey

198
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,199
they defied somewhere where there is
someone else on the 30-day Santana

199
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,240
on it also meant that there are a bunch
of people who

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,740
wanted to apply in the next window and
get and so it took out hundreds of

201
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,240
people

202
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,100
mostly the people anymore urban areas
which is sad the case

203
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,670
if you low-power you don't go that far
so the best place to be is an urban area

204
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,509
I'm so the FCC went ahead and they
commissioned on

205
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:11,690
the MITRE Corporation this the private
contractor to do a multi-million-dollar

206
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,519
study and the preparation did the study
and they said

207
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,759
I looks great no problems with
interference you don't have to worry

208
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,589
about it

209
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,889
and said the SEC said okay great on and

210
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,029
been kinda waited for congress to change
lives back congress

211
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,339
didn't do anything ISO for media if and
some other people started pushing

212
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,959
Congress pretty hard to change each
worth

213
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:38,560
on and been doing that for about six
years nasa congressional cycle takes two

214
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,350
years

215
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,740
this is that third cycle at it I'm so
the study thing is that we've gotten a

216
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,540
lot further this cycle than we ever have
before

217
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,920
I'm the bill has actually passed out of
the house on

218
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,019
and pretty much all I have to do is pass
at the senate

219
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,060
on an active president assigning and

220
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,579
he's a little bit of a hang-up which is
a on

221
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,220
there's a senator from Oklahoma named
tom coburn

222
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,019
who has put a hold on the bill and here
a couple people

223
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,689
laughing Sep bit that you everything ok
over Houston

224
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,540
the very first hey if you google said it
hot line because he is such a reputation

225
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,980
for doing this his reputation as a

226
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,339
on he put old on pillows on and they
never take them off

227
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,420
so we're starting to look into

228
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,719
had a deal with that so I'm gonna pass
around the sign up sheet in a minute if

229
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,670
you happen to be from oklahoma you
should definitely sign up

230
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,300
and will probably call you at some point
and we may ask you to put some pressure

231
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,220
your senator I'm

232
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,529
welcome so up but so

233
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,500
okay so that's a background that's up
our fam you want to talk a little bit

234
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,769
more broadly about the airwaves in
general

235
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,319
job and because a

236
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:58,769
you know at them as our it's a 65 70
year old technology

237
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,560
and you know and we're gonna get a
little bit into why

238
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,699
om why why we continue to love them so
much

239
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,470
up you know everyone's like really just
been studying the adoption of new

240
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,310
technologies

241
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,680
I'm kinda fascinated by why some
technologies just seem to keep on

242
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,839
sticking around

243
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,240
and there are some some really
interesting reasons that that 93 percent

244
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,459
of americans still listen to FM radio

245
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:26,019
every week even though there's like all
these new advanced things coming out

246
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:29,680
but so we'll get into that but I do want
to go talk about like

247
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,930
what's gonna happen with the future of
the airwaves um

248
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,680
because there's a lot that's come out
since outbound

249
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,790
arm when radio was first invented

250
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,610
you know it was mostly just people kinda
screwing around with like

251
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,079
Giants sparks an marked up some things

252
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,149
and so the very first radio the miracle
was

253
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:55,189
it was action at a distance

254
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:59,050
without wires and and you could like
push the button here

255
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,610
and its giant spark whiplash and then
bike

256
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,899
over there are like 500 feet away

257
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:09,019
like like you get this little click you
know and

258
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:12,879
and and so that was the amazing wonder a
radio in 1892

259
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,360
like it was super spooky at that time
but then

260
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,220
they realize like it as a with that
they're trying to make it practical

261
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,129
they're like

262
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,709
there can only be one of these in the
world on

263
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,040
you know because there's you know like
you have the giant our class and then

264
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,189
you know the thing goes kleck so they
started

265
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:34,839
coming up playing with different things
and they came up with the idea abusing

266
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,220
frequency to create chance

267
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,449
and self on I know it's really
complicated it's going way

268
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,540
before like what I really am sad now but
they have these giant machines with

269
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,079
with giant armatures and spinning desks
and arcs that would

270
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,499
like spark you know like a hundred
thousand cycles per second

271
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,749
and they were like certain like things
and what they would do is like you have

272
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:59,339
some frequencies

273
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:04,050
that up you know one frequency would be
one channel and you know another

274
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,339
you note that the guy that's going fifty
thousand times around per second

275
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,249
they have their own channel on the guy
that's like at forty thousand

276
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,279
per second they get their own channel
two and oMG eventually came up with a

277
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
clever ways that

278
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,040
weren't limited by the speed at which
they could make motors rotate

279
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,180
and you know all kinds of things along
those lines

280
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,870
and then on they start realizing that
they had to regulate it

281
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,050
in such a way to to create a system
where everyone would have

282
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,879
their own channels and so if you can
imagine the legal framework behind

283
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,620
early radio was if you think a highway

284
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,220
and you have one lane where all the baby
monitors work

285
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,689
and you have another plane were all the
CB operators alike

286
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:52,819
break break good buddy now and then like
you have another plane where all da

287
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,949
II AM radio stations are working so

288
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:59,990
everyone gets their own land no one can
go in each other's lane because well I

289
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,600
would be

290
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,660
now the terror home so that was the
basis of

291
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,800
up early radio regulation but

292
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,129
arm what happened was

293
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,949
that you know and not work for a long
time more and more frequencies became

294
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:16,600
usable and more and more

295
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,550
you know technology came on but one
problem with it was

296
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,959
most the time people were really using
those frequencies

297
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,579
I mean your baby monitors on all the
time but usually the baby is not a crime

298
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,670
and so no real information is going over
it

299
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,680
your garage door opener there's a
special frequency for it but usually

300
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,149
you're not opening and closing your
garage

301
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,220
so on so there's an incredible
inefficiency to that system where

302
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,170
they're all these different lanes

303
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,149
now overtime %ah some advances happen
like the division digitisation about

304
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,029
audio

305
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,110
which made it so that you can be a
little bit more tolerant to delays

306
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,509
and buffering and all that sort of thing
and

307
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:02,420
arm and then there was a and next up
where people started to experiment with

308
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,440
unlicensed bands where there would be

309
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,270
this portion of the band the 2.4
gigahertz work anyone could do anything

310
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,970
as long as they follow a few simple
rules om which was you know there are 10

311
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,670
or 20 channels there are no one can go
over certain power

312
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,060
the experts predicted chaos there like
this is gonna be junk

313
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,399
you know this is like just a mass like
anyone could do anything it's like

314
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,470
frat party like you know just like a big
mass

315
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,900
it but actually what happened was
because the power

316
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,010
level Mehmet and because that the
devices

317
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,950
follow the rules it became one of the
most intensively use bands that there

318
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,510
were

319
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,950
and that's where we get wifi now that's
where

320
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,060
all kinds of devices run that were much
more complicated relations before

321
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,639
and so it was an enormous success the my
son spent

322
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,790
and then some people start even thinking
about the next hour which is

323
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,840
you know in %uh sixties and seventies
the internet was being developed for the

324
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,139
military

325
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,150
and their big concern was

326
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,450
you know okay we have the hot line from
the president to the

327
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,630
missile silo or whatever but what if the
russians

328
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,450
here that what phone line and we can't
fire of our missiles back or whatever so

329
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,130
they were all worried about all the
stuff

330
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,970
and so they created a you know done
interweb

331
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,120
you know like with all you know these
different routes that you could get

332
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,330
there

333
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,770
well so at this point some other people

334
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,320
that were thinking that work like
thinking about how the internet should

335
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,750
work

336
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,460
have turned their attention to the radio
airwaves

337
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,900
and thinking about that stupid problem
I'd like all those lanes on the highway

338
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,190
that you nor unused most the time

339
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,190
and and wouldn't it be better you know
since we're kinda running out a spectrum

340
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,930
to to do it the way we have done it if
you could have

341
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,400
things like opportunistic sharing or in
other words white spaces devices which

342
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,710
are devices that

343
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,200
allowed you to you %ah it's like

344
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,840
it's a at the transmitter but it's got a
little receiver in it and the receivers

345
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,370
like

346
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,880
from is the baby crying no

347
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,370
okay I think I just thought that the
baby frequency right now

348
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,000
and then up book based are crying okay
I'm gonna switch over

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,360
you now and check out another band I'll
oh yeah okay the

350
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,570
the CB radio band sounds pretty good
right now I think of my little

351
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,450
flip a vigil day after that and so for

352
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,670
thats that's what the technology can do
I mean these devices are already being

353
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,260
you know put together our and the SEC's
even like tentatively im

354
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,140
approved some experimentation with them
but they haven't really quite completed

355
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,820
the process

356
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,010
and sell we could be looking at a future
where there is

357
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,650
ubiquitous free communication and where

358
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,320
it's not really as much about like

359
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,429
getting to the internet is like getting
a contract with Comcast but like

360
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,780
my cell phone talks with the water
cooler the water cooler talk to your

361
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,450
like little implant things that people
are playing around with here are

362
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,680
them plan things talks about the cameras
and Mike

363
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,610
just the it's a web devices that play by
a certain Sat

364
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,390
up walls om as opposed to you connecting

365
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,530
to gonna interweb out there

366
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,610
so at how exciting except for

367
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,030
its kinda looks really happen I'm

368
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,590
this is where I get to talk about the
depressing part again and Zelda classic

369
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,530
heart

370
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,010
I i wanna talk a little bit about at the
reality of what's happening to the

371
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,550
spectrum and a couple

372
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,560
things that you may have heard about
that are kinda in AZ

373
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,450
case on so for background their to rules
I recommend keeping in mind

374
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,990
if you're trying to figure out how
spectrum changes will happen

375
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,820
on the first is it in less everyday
people are really really loud

376
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,800
the FCC basically goes well incumbent
broadcasters are incumbents on the

377
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,830
spectrum one

378
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm because those are the people they
talk to you on they can get them is the

379
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,030
experts

380
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,560
sometimes they ask for public comment on
but if too many people from the public

381
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,800
comment they say we wait that's not what
we meant we just wanted the experts K

382
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,010
comment I'm the second thing is the
incumbent

383
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,740
on tender claims that day own the
spectrum for that it's theirs and they

384
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,470
have some

385
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,570
like sacred right to the spectrum on so
that's not really how it works

386
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,639
public going to spectrum and feck I'll
by sense

387
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,870
give someone a basis to use a certain
private spectrum for

388
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,310
a certain thing for a finite period of
time on

389
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,560
but this is president now have
compensating people when you take

390
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,179
spectrum away from them so people tend
to think about a Sony

391
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,410
man so with those things in mind one
thing

392
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,420
you may have heard about lately is this
National Broadband Plan think the FCC is

393
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,000
coming up with an

394
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,030
on seems to be a lot of pressure and it
said

395
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,040
I love the idea of the National
Broadband Plan is FTC said

396
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,070
Anna seems wake the Internet is more
than just entertainment these days it

397
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,070
seems to be

398
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,980
really critical infrastructures so
everyone in the US should have its so

399
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,750
we're gonna make sure that by 2020
everyone has access to

400
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,150
I 4 megabits per second download ray and
one megabit per second

401
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,140
obliterate on so that's cool I don't
think it's that mind-blowing

402
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,970
on when I with make in high school one
megabit per second

403
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,920
sounded like a lot on it dozen

404
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,240
sound like that much anymore it turns
out %uh

405
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,680
a lot of the countries that are leading
the world in this Rd have that

406
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,820
on and our plan is to have that by 2020

407
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,379
I'm but regardless if that it seems like
if you're performing bribe and maybe

408
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,310
that's a good place to make some space

409
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,110
for II opportunistic sharing an
unlicensed F

410
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,780
on the internet the case on the Internet
is one place where that is already

411
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,540
worked pretty well sued the FEC says
they're gonna take

412
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,230
they're gonna make 500 megahertz of
spectrum available

413
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,690
on for mobile broadband and most is that
it's going to be between 225 megahertz

414
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,800
and 3.7 gigahertz soon the first thing
to note about that is that 500 megahertz

415
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,420
is a wider spectrum

416
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,940
on they whole f'n ban for radio is 20
megahertz I think I've

417
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,840
25 times that all new stuff I getting
allocated for broadband

418
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,280
and the second thing is it I V give them
a range

419
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,110
from 225 megahertz take 3.7 gigahertz

420
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,940
that's actually a really nice place to
be so 225 megahertz

421
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,720
is I'm about where you hit the range
where you can use small enough and

422
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,250
tennis to be good in mobile devices

423
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,940
on and upper edges days 3.7 get hurt
that's about where

424
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,080
your way to stop being good at
penetrating things like walls

425
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,610
so you're in this range that's really
good for anything its mobile the case

426
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,680
you can make it small and you can at
least get there a couple of

427
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,680
and so

428
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,690
they've talked a little bit ago
unlicensed devices on here

429
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,740
on it seems like there's still the
potential to you some other

430
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,860
space for and buy some stuff but on
they've also been talking a lot about

431
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,210
auctions so auctioning spectrum means
that year

432
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,880
I getting money for and one particular
company gets exclusive rights to that

433
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,580
for this pattern so that's that everyone
gets one lane on highway

434
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,210
on and to to make it even worse

435
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,250
on the summer the spectrum is used by

436
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,070
TV right now and a TV broadcasters don't
want to give up their spectrum through

437
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,899
the SEC's talking about

438
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,430
I letting them have them in the money
that comes in from the auctions

439
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,990
on as compensation so in the big picture
you have

440
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:37,500
on spectrum that's getting used the same
old way that's not that efficient on

441
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,130
the seem corporations that have been
using it in the past republican be

442
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,230
buying more a bit

443
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,360
sum up the money I'm instead of just
make going to close a budget gap is

444
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,080
actually gonna go back to other big
broadcasters

445
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,189
on and they're gonna charge you to use
the spectrum

446
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,880
so I'm it's not a great deal that's if
not all written in stone

447
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,500
on the having actually made it was about
it they just put up this plan so there's

448
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,570
still a little bit have an opportunity

449
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,950
on Ted push for both it maybe make a
little more sense than

450
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,020
on a second thing that's happening is

451
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,220
there's on this process observed

452
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,800
trying to get people to start using
digital radio

453
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,200
on also seems like a great idea to
digital radios more efficient that means

454
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,100
you can send more stuff from the same in
an inspection

455
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,280
on the current implementation

456
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,070
I is something should probably show you
in visual form

457
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,500
on it hybrid digital radio ads but it's
usually called

458
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,220
and forget about those five man

459
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,290
and look at that one for now so on

460
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,830
in hybrid digital radio the only people
who can use digital radio are the people

461
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,179
who already have

462
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,460
analogue radio stations on because

463
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,110
instead of taking a new section at
spectrum and making it the digital part

464
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:01,110
on they just a well you can use a little
bit of spectrum right next to the part

465
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,350
you already have

466
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,380
so in the picture there and there's an
analog station

467
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,530
in the middle they said Green Line at
17.3

468
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,930
and this is from a spectrum analyzer saw
the little white lines are

469
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,900
where your signal is on and then off to
either side of that

470
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,740
is where the digital signal said ok he
said that your analog signal and then

471
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,560
you

472
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,270
hi includes in step 2 Julien said that
on the sides

473
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,850
on their three pretty big problems if if

474
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,240
can my opinion so one is it nobody knew
gets you suspect in this way you already

475
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,220
have to have a radio station to do this
digital thing

476
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,470
on second problem is problem with
interference and I feel kinda funny

477
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,970
talking about this now because we just
talked about

478
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,790
bullshit interference problems on but if
you look at it

479
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,370
that picture there on you'll see either
of these orange and blue lines on the

480
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,120
side so those are the first adjacent
stations

481
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,700
and those white lines from the digital
stuff on the side

482
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,170
are practically on top of the first to
Jason stations

483
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,570
I'm and those are generally about more
powerful than say that

484
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,060
the power FN's on food there's

485
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,120
bad been some research showing that
there are problems with the fuel

486
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,840
stations interfering with the station's
next to them

487
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,810
and also interfering with their own
analog signal I'm so for radio station

488
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,270
you really like to schedule it

489
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,040
and you don't have a digital radio it
might be hard to hear them in Anaheim

490
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,250
on so third problem you

491
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:32,120
on may have heard hybrid radio referred
to as HD Radio

492
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,070
I'm lot of people for obvious reasons
think that the HTC Sense for

493
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,250
high-definition

494
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,130
I'm it actually doesn't so I it
supposedly at one point said for hybrid

495
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,150
a joke but now it's just one of those
weird trademark names

496
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,310
I'm so this company called my dignity
has trademarked the name HD Radio

497
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:53,520
so why does on accompany get to pick a
name that we all use when we talk about

498
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,940
digital radio

499
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,690
on well in a lot of countries that are
doing the hybrid digital thing

500
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,750
there you seen on and opening including
scheme

501
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,650
for when may turn everything into
digital and turn it back in the analog

502
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,910
seems to be working pretty well the way
that it's going in the US

503
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,850
is a I've FCC says there's only one way
you can do it and you have to use this

504
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,670
one for pride Terry scheme

505
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,860
it was made by the company I dignity
that trademark the name HD Radio

506
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,230
on so that means for one thing if you
wanna

507
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,500
be a broadcaster doing a digital signal
you have to pay

508
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,360
something on the order of a hundred
thousand dollars just to get set up with

509
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,300
everything

510
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,090
and about five thousand dollars a year
in royalties to a big booty

511
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,250
on for using their scheme I'm and then
if you wanna

512
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,690
was in the 80 ready you have to buy and
HD receiver

513
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,890
and some the money that you spend on
that is of the going towards paying

514
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,480
royalties tried equity

515
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,480
and so this is a little different from
the broadband model

516
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,660
because I'm instead of getting charged
directly for the spectrum use your

517
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,190
getting

518
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,850
charge by a company that's implementing
the technology

519
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,460
on but it still means nobody knew is
getting on the air

520
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,670
on and your getting charged to put
something out

521
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,750
and you're getting charged to receive
something so here kinda getting screwed

522
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,020
at either end of it

523
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,629
on so the main lesson day

524
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,210
I think should come out of this on is
that we need to be ladder bookcase

525
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,250
on if we're not the FTC's gonna give
what other big broadcasters 1

526
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,500
and we're doing a little bit of the
spectrum reform suffered from EPS but

527
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,910
there are other people who are devoting
all their resources to its so

528
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,760
if you want to learn more on about the
big picture spectrum stuff

529
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,890
I'd actually recommend looking at
someone like you America Foundation they

530
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,670
do

531
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,250
what a similar stuff if a lot of good
resources on the Internet

532
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:49,480
on and they're doing good work had a big
shout out to Ben Cobb in the audience

533
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:49,900
today

534
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,980
who like any %uh via anything that

535
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,560
we know about every we learned a lot
from him up parts about that we made up

536
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,470
are not his fault own the

537
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,920
one lasting on is the another question
we get asked a lot is

538
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,270
I make feel the same way you still do
this analogue radio thing when there's

539
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,920
all this new technology

540
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,980
on there's an obvious reasons I think
that I just outline for why someone near

541
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,120
technology isn't working very well

542
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,210
on but just two kinda recap

543
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,760
I'm FM radio is really cheap to produce

544
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,370
so low-power FM stations can get started
for somewhere on the order of ten

545
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,600
thousand dollars if you're really
cheaper that stuff

546
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,470
on and you're only using a hundred what
so you don't have really big ongoing

547
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,870
power that you have to pay for I'm and
it's basically free taking Sam

548
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,040
like radios cost you know ten bucks time

549
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,370
and you don't have to pay to use them
except for a tiny bit of power

550
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,730
and its skills really well so II
internet radio if I'm in Internet

551
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,510
broadcaster

552
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,390
I have to pay more money for every new
listener I guess on FM radio you can

553
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,260
have as many with tears as you want and
you don't have to pay anything extra for

554
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,870
on and then above all that people still
listening to FM radio a lot

555
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,180
those statistic I heard pretty recently
waste a

556
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,660
on ninety-three percent of people in the
US listen to

557
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,370
FM radio once a week I'm
thirteen-percent listening to internet

558
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,140
radio

559
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,840
that once a week only seven percent of
the country has even heard him HD Radio

560
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,330
and that's exactly the same percent that
it was in 2006

561
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,649
so it doesn't seem to be going anywhere
an so we still think that FM radio is

562
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,380
pretty cool

563
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,220
we still do a lot of it I'm and going
back to the uplifting step it's gonna

564
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,140
talk a little bit about the radio
station burn racing's that we do with FM

565
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,670
stations

566
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:42,220
yeah Chartwell I mean and we do these
events that we call where you buy me

567
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,980
things

568
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,200
%ah for one reason

569
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,830
om as a as a political tactic in order
to build public consciousness about the

570
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,830
issues up who owns the spectrum and

571
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,280
and how it's used because you know most
the time most people just really don't

572
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,530
even think you know they don't know what
channel from a frequency from up

573
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,590
me now from a death without on so it's
an opportunity to like

574
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:10,400
tests or shine a light on these issues
but so what we do

575
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,980
at the Radio bar me things is we

576
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,150
Cobb we gather about three or four
hundred people

577
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,190
together at 1 on the New River the new
radio licenses that we got

578
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,210
com so and not usually it's like a group
that house like some like really

579
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,620
incredible story like

580
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,950
their farm workers organization and
that's been fighting the bosses in order

581
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,980
to like

582
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,480
get a raise for the past 10 years and
like the toll shut out the

583
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,370
local media and Tom and they really
wanna radio station to be able to help

584
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,170
them organize

585
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,460
so are their environmental group that's
been fighting

586
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,390
a new shopping mall being built on the
on the Chesapeake Bay and

587
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,540
you know and and they've been blacked
out by the local media

588
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,120
and and they want I'll await a reply on
my call the issues that are bred right

589
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,250
product for

590
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,590
a civil rights group that's been working
on education reform and Mike

591
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,270
um farmers cooperatives in you know and
they've been Mike left of the dial to

592
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,820
so so we'll will work with a group like
not that really needs a voice in the

593
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,939
media that really needs a bigger are

594
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,070
om voice in the local democracy and

595
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,550
will bring about 300 people I and
possibly a lot of people locally

596
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,300
%ah and I and we start on Friday morning

597
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,810
and like all the equipment is just like
sorta satin around in a pile

598
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,500
and we have thirty or forty workshops
and over the course of the week and

599
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,250
like we like up workshops on how to tune
in antenna on how to

600
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,570
wire up a mixing board and how to I you
know do all the same and then

601
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,439
it's not just technical I mean we do a
lot to demystify

602
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,520
the technology but also the the policy
process

603
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,650
and how to like organize yourself how to
like kill a conflict in a group out to

604
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,340
you

605
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,750
raise money how to you know come up with
a with policies about governing

606
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,880
yourself so over the course that we can
like we tried you

607
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,160
everything that you need to know not
everything you need to know

608
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,270
but a lot of what you what will need to
get started to run a radio station

609
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,418
and om nobody sleeps

610
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:15,960
very much arm and you know by Saturday

611
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,480
at six o'clock we've gotta be on the air
so

612
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,510
om its kinda nice because like sometimes
like

613
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,200
Nevada you know a lot of things like
where people are talking a politics

614
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
people spend the whole time

615
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,100
arguing with each other but it's very
nice to have a goal where r

616
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,469
okay me know if you guys gonna fight
about this stuff we just won't

617
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,550
you know if fast the radio station
before we leave you now

618
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,810
and now be really helpful on so

619
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,009
so people I kinda but that's upside in
the focus and they

620
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,350
and they and they put the radio station
on yeah and then the first broadcasters

621
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,549
at six o'clock and we just like

622
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,100
arm you know all the new DJ's like you
know the plainness honor to your they'll

623
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,009
talk about like

624
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,720
what kinda show that they're gonna do
not like short interviews in my call

625
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,850
vocal talent

626
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,680
so they're super super exciting and

627
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,359
home were really excited that there's
actually gonna be one

628
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,680
not too far from him so our next burned
regime

629
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,080
is going to be a this fines de Dave New
York a little bit north of here in the

630
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,440
Hudson Valley

631
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,020
and one thing that's really exciting I'm
about the bond rating is coming up is

632
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,550
all the other brand ratings we've done
have been for low-power FM stations

633
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,710
which are great

634
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,000
on but every once in a while someone
gets a license for a full power station

635
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,110
on which is especially good in rural
areas like the Hudson Valley and

636
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:41,610
on full power radio stations can reach
on a lot further so

637
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,460
we have this little map up here this is
that predicted coverage

638
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,650
a I w/ txt just a station that will be
building in Hudson

639
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,290
and the blue contour there is the area
where they signal is supposed to be

640
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,370
really awesome

641
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,170
on the orange line around that is where
it should be pretty good

642
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,880
on and I know that that's kinda small
and you probably can't see any of

643
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,980
what's up there except for the lines but
on there's a green line going through

644
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,130
the middle and thats

645
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,240
II 87 and the

646
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,890
this stretch of the green line that goes
from the bottom to the top of the blue

647
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,710
is about 85 miles

648
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,800
on so that means that there's gonna be
no Lake

649
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,230
over a 100 mile stretch where you can
hear their radio station pretty well if

650
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,740
you're driving up the interstate

651
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,840
on even further if you're going west to
east

652
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,990
not so this is really big and

653
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:38,160
on 3300 what's that's more walks than
all the others we put together perfect

654
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,290
combined I'm the other reason this is
exciting is the case this is

655
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,130
a really awesome organization on w/ txt
came out of a group called

656
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,420
310 3.9 on and

657
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,480
31 a 3.9 has been doing webcasting for a
while so they are ready can have the

658
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,510
radiating down

659
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,760
and they have this place called the way
farm

660
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,390
where they do all kinds of transmission
arts so

661
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,609
on the havoc transmission sculptures all
over the farm

662
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,220
my favorite one is this culture that has
all these discs

663
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,110
on it's been around at speeds that are
determined by winds that are measured in

664
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,110
five different places around the state

665
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,950
I'm in the disc somehow producing are
you signal and the audio signal gets

666
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,360
sent out over shortwave so you have this
really pretty spinning sculpture

667
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,510
but you also can listen on shortwave
radio in here

668
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,960
Lake some representation at the Wynn
using five different places around the

669
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,660
state

670
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,430
I'm and they're also working on Justin
gay teen pretty much everyone else in

671
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,370
their community who might be interested
in doing radio

672
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,750
on so will be there in September at the
barn raising is

673
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,020
said 24 through that twenty dick on

674
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,110
and there's bunch of information you can
Rd register for on our website for me to

675
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,450
use radio .org

676
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,400
so if you think that you might wanna I'm
help though the radio station and teach

677
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,490
a bunch of other people about radio

678
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,510
while you're at it on then you should go

679
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,760
and up before we take questions

680
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,820
on just want to acknowledge a couple
people so JJ and Pablo both contributed

681
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,750
much effort as we use Chris made the
awesome logo on the last slide

682
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,710
on and if you actually like get your
hands dirty answered on the radio stuff

683
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,800
instead of just listening to it talk
about it

684
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,170
on tomorrow at noon we're gonna be
building little tiny radio transmitters

685
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,130
in the hackerspace village come check it
out

686
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,680
yeah these these transmitters are pretty
cool there are um

687
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,000
they were developed by this guy to 20
Kagawa in Japan

688
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,190
and he noticed like a little loophole in
the rules they are

689
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,920
that um you could actually have a radio
station

690
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,510
up to a quarter of a lot and and

691
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,980
that's not very much but in Tokyo

692
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,960
like that could be like 10,000 people
like Justin like a quarter mile radius

693
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,270
so like so there was this little many

694
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,600
of amber room in the eighties and on
these are actually weaker than that

695
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,839
they're just like at this very simplest
transmitters just 14 parts

696
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,200
and dot you know it may come from
scratch and you know you probably

697
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,760
upgrade it to our

698
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,890
that whole quarter what if you're really
clever but you know tomorrow I'll just

699
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,319
be a

700
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:18,230
I really basic version other time
alright so often questions

701
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:23,720
then oh no he's gonna correct all the
stuff that I got wrong about to open

702
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,890
spectrum

703
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,370
up correct anything at all

704
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,380
the I just want to underscore a what
Maggie talked about

705
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,450
with regard to this 500 megahertz have
spectrum this is going to be a

706
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,170
battleground a huge battle ground

707
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,400
over who is going to get to control that
spectrum

708
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,270
a it's worth noting that a lot of this
is already allocated

709
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,820
and so this is one of the reasons wise
easy for the white house

710
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,460
to say look we've got this fantastic
huge chunk of spectrum that's on the way

711
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,910
some ovett is allocated to a company
that launched a satellite

712
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:03,720
the is over 10 years ago call them said
that has not been a very good business

713
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,630
and overtime they have persuaded the FCC
to let them

714
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:13,090
for forget about the satellite turn this
into a big nationwide competitor to the

715
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,880
Verizon AT&T and T Mobile

716
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,410
as ace basically terrestrial cellular
network

717
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,290
another thing is what happens to
unlicensed

718
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,130
win the White House representative
announced this the PISA spectrum

719
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,150
recently

720
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,700
he said government is not going to make
these decisions about who gets the

721
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,670
spectrum

722
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,160
but he also said we want some ovett for
unlicensed

723
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,368
these two things are completely opposed
to each other

724
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:44,710
there's lots of companies pushing to bid

725
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,500
in huge options for the spectrum but

726
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,640
if it's unlicensed there's no licenses
to auction

727
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,029
an unlicensed means wifi and similar

728
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,730
on devices that you and I will be using
in the future

729
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,670
so the big question is how much of it
are they going to keep out of the

730
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,090
auctions

731
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:08,250
and use for unlicensed where that
spectrum doesn't generate any billions

732
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,260
of dollars for the government

733
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,940
up totally well well this gentleman same
as a side will be richer that's

734
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,980
absolutely the case but I from
Washington DC in the basement

735
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,530
and things the Big Society Richard it's
all about making private parties Richard

736
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:28,210
so so please watch this closely and if
you get an opportunity to

737
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,860
to lobby to make contact with congress
about this

738
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,260
um this is going to be the difference
between whether all of the spectrum is

739
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,680
going to be

740
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,850
available to you only at high prices

741
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,839
in Siler phone service or through
whatever is going to use for

742
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,740
or whether you will have the opportunity
to use it without having to pay

743
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,070
large corporations to use it

744
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,440
Jackson thanks for comment I just want
to say I have

745
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,720
no doubt whatsoever that them were

746
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,560
spectrum is unlicensed for any kinda
free

747
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,380
innovation the Richard that our entire
society will become

748
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,470
and that tiny little didn't have money
that they make an auction

749
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:15,930
bequeathing all that power to AT&T and
Verizon

750
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:20,049
will take away I mean we waited fifty
years

751
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,330
for phones to advanced beyond dial
phones

752
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,529
they stated our phones from the thirties
to the eighties

753
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,600
until they split up Bell Telephone so if
you want that kind of lack of innovation

754
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,630
just let them auction of this spectrum

755
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,960
there is something you can do you can go
to open Internet dot gov

756
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,510
open Internet dot gov and let your voice
be heard very few people speak on their

757
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,510
so thought couple hundred people from
here get on there

758
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,190
I know that the FCC administrators are
all reading that

759
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:56,170
really do read it well and one thing all
just point out

760
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,340
they want 10 they want to like option of
the spectrum

761
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,390
but they're not even gonna make the
people that get the spectrum commit to

762
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,069
be not neutral

763
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,720
reso's you could end up with like a very
sound foolish thing to do

764
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,369
auction of the spectrum because those
companies are just gonna turn around and

765
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:14,690
charge us anyway so we're gonna pay
twice

766
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,850
yeah substance that's kinda dumb to

767
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:23,420
that was a good Bush administration idea
but yeah I like seeing Obama

768
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,070
think have a question for you about the
windows that you talked about for the

769
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:32,380
applications obviously a.m. you guys are
still doing barn raising kids

770
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,040
so are there windows that her

771
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,690
opening for LPFM or is this

772
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:43,990
in in that mean can can you explain a
little bit about

773
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,460
where are these licenses coming from
because

774
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,560
it seems like there was a huge store
that opened in it slammed shut

775
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,820
really fast yep that's a great question
and that's not actually

776
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,950
too far out so there is a certified
Windows on I love the burn reasons we've

777
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:59,890
done so far

778
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,200
have been people who got licenses back
in the swing that sometimes it takes

779
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,350
awhile for everything

780
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,779
actually come through on so

781
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,840
yeah so food the last fundraising we did
wage gains

782
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,750
summer 07 and not let somebody it
applied in the original window

783
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,660
on there has been one window for full
car licenses

784
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,700
on FCC is actually said that they're
holding off on doing another window in

785
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,560
till

786
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,170
essentially kill this bill passes in
congress because it's not worth it for

787
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,160
them to do a window now and do another
window after that will change

788
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,930
on so it I

789
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,118
if the bill passes you know in the next
couple months then we're looking at

790
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:39,770
another

791
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,780
window for another round of Windows any

792
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,590
probably the next year with with the way
the bills written now

793
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,369
what how many stations are you talking
about

794
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:55,490
that would open availability for and or
any other million

795
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:00,310
metropolitan areas or did does it remove
enough up the problems with the

796
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,759
interference the BS the bill by itself

797
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,580
does not do not oMG the bill basically
gives authority back to the FTC

798
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,930
and once the the FTC has the authority
than

799
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:18,140
mom a lot of things can happen guess is
he's already tentatively concluded that

800
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,230
they intend to loosen

801
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,790
the the app to help get them rolls and
make it possible

802
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,890
for our stations use more sophisticated
analyses

803
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:32,040
and and find more channels particularly
in the urban areas so

804
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,150
we're really excited the main thing we
need first

805
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:39,300
congress get out the way than sac and
you know we got a deal the up to feel a

806
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,000
bit more

807
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,160
but once we got those two steps done

808
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,259
than it seems like there's gonna be prey
I mean not a million stations

809
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,420
you know not ten thousand stations but
there's gonna be

810
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,369
Arvada radio stations that are available
arm as a result event

811
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:57,940
and %uh you know that and some of them
will be and summer the largest

812
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,280
metropolitan areas

813
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,710
not dozens but but a few um

814
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,730
Mostro areas will have plenty of
spectrum for for anyone that wants star

815
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,110
a radio station after this bill goes
through them alright

816
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,150
third time's up on but will be around
