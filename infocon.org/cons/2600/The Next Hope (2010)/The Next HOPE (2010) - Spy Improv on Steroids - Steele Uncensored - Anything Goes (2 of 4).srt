1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,320
for a sir in the back

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,840
I giving back silly in at and where to
take a break at two

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,040
for up before you talking about I
dictators and how you should put any day

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,200
care in a corner

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,749
a leading career for the last five years
or so and altering

6
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:19,869
of course and %uh

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,960
and what do you think should be done

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,960
about you know the chinese are handling
North Korea

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,660
%uh I think our biggest mistake was was

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,469
the was basically

11
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,829
6 staying on the Korean Peninsula in the
first place

12
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,629
we have 750 bases all over the world

13
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,449
I mean there's a wonderful DVD called
how we fight and

14
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:55,640
come come in right to your there's a
wonderful DVD called

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,070
how we fight and it basically links wars

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,760
with pulling people out of poverty a

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,429
or creating poverty and then having a
war is a kind of a cycle

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,310
on Vietnam in fact there's now some very
interesting documentation coming out

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,580
that we went into vietnam

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,320
knowing it was the wrong war for the
wrong reason and that it would cost this

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,840
a fifty thousand casualties in last 10
years on is a wonderful book also

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,650
like I first-time author Michael him
called

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,750
who the hell are we fighting and it
features Sam Adams

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:34,140
who is a is complaining one day that
here we are in agree or in the pentagon

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,870
is a leading discount degree s

26
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,310
okay and then it has another really
excellent quote from Sherman can asking

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,260
Sam Adams

28
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,390
are we reaching the boundaries have
reasonable dishonesty

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,190
okay what reasonable dishonesty is what
your government is all about

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,509
and that's wrong money jump up and

31
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,740
and give me something there what are
your thoughts

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,370
on a Arizona's immigration law as on
movement and

33
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,250
imminent amnesty for what was the middle
one as a la movement

34
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,020
you know the South was plunked Mexico oh
well it does actually

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,300
the Guadalupe Hidalgo treaty they favor
retaking it they had a lot of babies

36
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,310
on you know the the bottom line here and
and I i say this is someone who does

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,500
have a Latino blood

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,060
my mother was born in Colombia on first
of

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,740
a it's really fascinating and I do want
to get and I think after the break

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,010
because I've gotta go to the bathroom
but

41
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,489
up after the break if you want I would
love to get into this whole issue of

42
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,080
health

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,420
nations an artificial political
boundaries and how much trouble we've

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,230
created

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,750
with website deceit and so forth but the
reality is we burned all of the land

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,980
ownership records

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,069
up the mexicans in the first place so
that we could then drive them out at

48
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:54,750
gunpoint

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,290
and a there's a lot to be said for the
fact that they've simply

50
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,150
actually recovered what we took away
from them illegally in the first place

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,270
now having said that I strongly support
Arizona's

52
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,020
a immigration endeavors because the
federal government

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,170
is no longer setting floors it's now
setting see links

54
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,440
on everything including environmental
protection the federal government is now

55
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,319
the enemy of the public interest

56
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,380
let's stop on that note I'm gonna go to
the bathroom I realize a lot if you're

57
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,140
tired

58
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,170
up but I will stay as long as anybody
wants to have a question will put it on

59
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,640
video and that someone can

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,970
can't do you troops to their hearts
content so I'll be back in five minutes

61
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,970
situation

62
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,170
that was independent love the
contractors today we don't do

63
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,440
operational test evaluation fact I don't
think we've ever tested a nuclear

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,090
missile

65
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,980
we can't find a lot of them right now
okay

66
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,160
all I mean this is just amazing
absolutely amazing and secrecy is used

67
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,579
to cover all this up

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,650
on so E

69
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,989
the services are outta control %uh the
air force has it built a decent airplane

70
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:15,140
says the a-ten

71
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,199
on I'm friends with Chuck's penny and

72
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,349
and indirectly with Pierre and others on

73
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,479
you know I mean we need stuff that's
long loiter for example the said the

74
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,699
average aviation day in the DOD is

75
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,300
is warm but not humid will the real
world day is hot and humid

76
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,069
and what that means is you're Locher
lifting your lawyer cut in half

77
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,599
but we don't build airplanes to a hot
day or humid day

78
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,099
and oh by the way the Navy likes to be
really big ships that state to 100

79
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:45,759
clicks

80
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,599
offshore which means you end up having
five minutes if your cover

81
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:54,289
and when you're in a low-intensity
conflict like somalia the Air Force

82
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,120
insists on eight-hour days for its
pilots a Puff the Magic Dragon has to go

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,919
home to the air conditioning

84
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,099
%uh when the marines here are getting
fired

85
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:08,430
you know all this is just nuts I mean I
couldn't make this stuff up

86
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,759
it's like a nightmare in the back sir
sure I'll

87
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,449
friendly stranger asked me about this
because I hadn't actually thought about

88
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,089
it and I wanted to bring it to you

89
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,469
is there anything that you can talk
about in terms of

90
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:24,889
conference coming at airplanes and
potential planting have no toxins and

91
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:28,689
control the population in that regard in
is that something

92
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,900
it the something that's actually going
on

93
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,789
know anything about the short answer is
No

94
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,229
but I'm very concerned

95
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,520
about the the

96
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,068
E think that we lack in the US
government is honest oversight

97
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:52,860
and I I don't know anything about contre
else but I do

98
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,759
have some knowledge love sum up the
secret camps with

99
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,909
for with couple thousand

100
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,229
man without a country and the

101
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,490
US serviceman being asked whether they'd
be willing to disarm US citizens and

102
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,830
Halliburton building prison camps here
in the US

103
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,830
weed is an awful lot of stuff for the
dots have not been connected

104
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,779
in a proper way for the public and I'm
not the person who can connect them for

105
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,439
you

106
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,289
but I think this is the kinda stuff we
need to be acutely sensitive to

107
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,479
and I personally am licensed to carry a
concealed weapon and I do

108
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,830
on I think every single one other should
be our

109
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,210
and very very dangerous

110
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,439
because our founding fathers understood

111
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,639
that if the citizens were not educated
and not

112
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,610
armored they would be turned into shape
under tyranny

113
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,089
on and my biggest disappointment with
Ron Paul is he's play acting being a

114
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,520
libertarian

115
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,128
he's not actually doing it and that's a
mistake because I think between Jess

116
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,189
even tour in ron paul a nitro Sarah
Palin in there

117
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,439
I mean you gotta have something to get
the Pentecostals and okay

118
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,460
South of I mean I I actually like Sarah
Palin

119
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,460
II I think she has enormous potential

120
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,460
on any what senator

121
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:24,080
yes I actually drove to des moines and
talked to secret service in the leading

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,369
me put a memorandum under restore

123
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:30,809
and this hotel was sold out I i talked
to a woman of color on the desk into

124
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:34,219
putting me into one of the two rooms the
secret service it blocked on either side

125
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,610
of Obama's room

126
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,469
and I took their own and then I went
down to the business center and I typed

127
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:42,360
up a memo saying this is what's gonna
happen to you when

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,149
you really need to govern strategically
and you really need to do

129
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:47,909
intelligence-driven government all this
Jess

130
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,419
and showed it to a secret service guy
gave my social security number he could

131
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,878
care less at that point

132
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,059
%uh and then I slipped it under store
and not only did I never hear from again

133
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:01,429
but my twenty faxes to David buffet and
two

134
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:06,619
David Axelrod and to Oprah Winfrey whose
private fax number was able to get

135
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,979
went unanswered okay Obama was there to
win the election

136
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:15,188
he was not there to govern in the public
interest and that is my disappointment

137
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,839
in Obama

138
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,879
actually a website called free Obama
dotnet

139
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,139
and I had that picture did you all see
the picture of Obama and Bush

140
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,349
a we see if I can get it up

141
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,509
on the screen here but you know

142
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,789
I Obamacare Obama could still

143
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,409
take control his own government and he
could still be the greatest president we

144
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,939
ever head

145
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,769
it may be too late on me judging by this
health care fiasco

146
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,089
on and you guys wanted to talk about
health care comes in four parts

147
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:54,670
part 1 is healthy lifestyle part 2 is
healthy environment without toxins part

148
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,319
3 as alternative and natural medicine
including but an oil for breast cancer

149
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,500
the AMA does not want you to know that

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,940
and that part for is is surgery in
pharmaceuticals at at a price you can

151
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,829
afford

152
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,060
the rest of the world pays one percent

153
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,750
of what we pay: for the top 75

154
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,410
drugs okay and if you go to Thailand and
South African other places you can buy

155
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,959
all 75% of our top drugs for 1 percent
of what we pay:

156
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,139
mean that's not snow in the back there
and I will come forward

157
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:32,850
how you feel about the anti-vaccine
movement people like

158
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,459
that said yeah I i actually support the
anti-vaccine movement I was very

159
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,759
uncomfortable as a young lieutenant
being

160
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,839
be treated as a guinea pig on

161
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,910
iight a with the bottom line is the
bottom line is the US government does

162
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,899
not know what it's doing

163
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,759
on and when you get right down to it

164
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,470
the US government is basically
bullshitting your

165
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,459
across a number of fronts and until we
get this fragmentation of knowledge

166
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,160
think done all right now i cant see my
on-screen

167
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,250
cf5

168
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,920
what

169
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,229
yes I am clueless you're absolutely
right on I some things I do well

170
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,529
for like clueless I'll

171
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:28,529
can't wait to see my own screen

172
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:34,560
okay

173
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,949
all right let's try that function for no
for

174
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:46,350
function f on

175
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,370
yeah except this is a Dell computer from

176
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,660
2005

177
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,300
see 20 oh well I carried CRT

178
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,709
start function CRT Ltd

179
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,600
of the jewel if

180
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,379
you're an amazing human being

181
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:18,829
function okay

182
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:22,139
give alright all

183
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,259
business line I wanna show you guys on
the fragmentation acknowledge what I've

184
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,920
completely forgot what I was talking
about

185
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,019
what was it 00 anti-vaccine

186
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,230
on

187
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,230
I've lost my train of thought that the
the bottom line

188
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,379
white

189
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:52,379
for 00 the year the face to face to face

190
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,980
now I have to tell you I did not create
this this incredible

191
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,160
more fun if I can ever find the person
who did I'd like to

192
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,199
acknowledge them permanently and and
really

193
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,879
express my appreciation because this is
the best more 5 ever seen

194
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:26,120
I had my graphics artist 21 and I've got
it here someplace

195
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,209
but this is the best on there is
absolutely no difference between Obama

196
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,250
and Bush

197
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,480
if you look at treasury i mean all the
ambassadors in Latin America are still

198
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,860
the ones that were appointed under Bush

199
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,540
Hillary Clinton is a nice lady but she
doesn't know jack shit about Latin

200
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,420
America

201
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,569
online and the its it's really truly
unfortunate we do not have a state

202
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,089
department that's actually thinking
about waging peace

203
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,560
so that's the that's the thing yes sir
and I will come back to you

204
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,259
who you datin ex-presidents gonna be
Republican or Democrat does it matter

205
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:06,769
I don't know if it's a if it is a I
democrat

206
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,790
he'll be hillary

207
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,209
I don't think so I mean a taste
something the Secret Service guys hate

208
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,319
for

209
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:19,819
on and they don't hate her because a
baller female guests

210
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:23,279
they hate her because she was an
absolute bitch to them

211
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,350
and she mistreated them and abuse them
in ways that they will never forget

212
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,540
and so if she ever runs for president I
have been told

213
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,469
by a secret service officer they will
release the list for guests

214
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,879
so I don't know but the my personal
feeling is we have an opportunity to put

215
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,389
someone like Jesse Ventura

216
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:48,209
into office on I have actually worked
with people to create a coalition

217
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:49,209
cabinet

218
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,699
and this is why Ron Paul pisses me off
so much because

219
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,910
he has an opportunity to play nice with
ralph nader except the McKinney and

220
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,620
Jackie sale it was an American hero

221
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,689
me which Jackie sale it did for
bloomberg which he then

222
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:06,939
really screwed over by going for a third
term arm

223
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:10,230
you've guys have heard the joke that
when clinton

224
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,209
found out the Bloomberg get it third
term lease it you can't do that

225
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,749
for a

226
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:22,459
but anyway %uh so I mean we have some
real heroes here in America

227
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,019
but they're not playing well with each
other I mean I'd bring lee iacocca in if

228
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:28,300
he still alive is a chief of staff

229
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,220
on and I would create a coalition
cabinet as a sunshine cabinet

230
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,089
and I would make intelligence-driven
policy with the balance budget

231
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,769
and I'd post a and I say excuse me

232
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,449
if we can do this why can't you and
that's the point at which corruption

233
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:46,439
comes and come to the mic and and

234
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:53,439
and get into this

235
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,339
it's not in there interests to play nice
because than their personal agendas

236
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:02,709
would be

237
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,649
abrogated by actually happy do something
then in that case drive in the fuck out

238
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,749
of office

239
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:12,490
and stop listening to them and start
over and

240
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,029
frankly Jesse Ventura is as good as it
gets

241
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:21,980
a you know a I mean any one of us could
be a better president than the ones

242
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,149
we've got now

243
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,420
on and a all it takes is integrity

244
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,079
and one other things that I've been told
is Obama's afraid to being assassinated

245
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,889
on and that's not an unreasonable fear

246
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:40,870
on I owe you the mic so please go there
and then we'll come back

247
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,579
do you think fidel castro is dead and if
so

248
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,189
when will we ever find out about it he
spoke to me yesterday

249
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:54,120
really I for

250
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,029
I don't think he's dead I actually I
think he just came out publicly

251
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,509
speaking on something and

252
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,410
and it was over an hour so we know it's
fidel a

253
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,309
to edit so no I don't think he's dead I
think he had a logical

254
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:14,059
turnover you know its it's a real shame
the cuba had the

255
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:17,379
had to be so screwed up but one of the
interesting things about cuba's it's

256
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,949
been pointed out to me

257
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:22,339
that the rest the Latin America learned
two things from the cuban experience

258
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,279
including the Bay of Pigs

259
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,540
all one they learned how screwed up the
US was and how the US could not make the

260
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,959
bay a pic stick

261
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,379
and that we actually with cuba because
the extreme right

262
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:38,550
overreaction and basically we put
dictators in the power or dictators came

263
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,689
to power

264
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:43,480
in Latin America because they were
acutely aware of the fact that Castro

265
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,059
had succeeded in cuba

266
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:49,350
on so you know the AM we will get to
this whole issue of

267
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,209
for love National artificial boundaries
and indigenous peoples and so forth

268
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,309
quick comment

269
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:57,360
and something even mentioned tickets on

270
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,759
do you see any hope in decentralizing
government giving back

271
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,970
our power to local governments actually
building strong the local governments in

272
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,460
taking care of our world that way

273
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,690
as opposed to having the centralized
authority which is doing

274
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,820
well there's a two-part answer to that
the first part and I learned this in

275
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,280
reading

276
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,430
deer hunting with Jesus is our local
governments are just as corrupt as our

277
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,740
national government

278
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,310
and 10 things I didn't realize was that
across america the Rotary Club in the

279
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,250
Planning Council all that

280
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,590
they're making sweetheart deals with
corporations are giving them tax breaks

281
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,720
a killing on public land

282
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,150
they're making there's on commissions
but

283
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,110
they're screwing over the public because
they're basically giving up all of the

284
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,790
taxes that would pay for proper
education

285
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,899
on at the local level soap are one of
the answer is no elite can be trusted we

286
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,900
actually have to get back to practical
participatory democracy

287
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,810
with complete transparency and we have
to control how

288
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,350
our dollars are spent on and I'm not
sure

289
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,169
for where we're going but the fact that
we're all starting to talk about this

290
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,990
the fact that women in kuwait can now
swore

291
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,430
and do a flash mob and then disappear

292
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,570
this is cool and so we're moving in the
right direction and I really think we're

293
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,290
going to reach a tipping point sometime
in the next five to 10 years

294
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,610
but coming back to this we should not
elect a Republican or Democrat effect

295
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,330
the legal Women Voters I'm still angry
at them

296
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,939
now I'm over the anchor I'm disappointed
on

297
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,870
the League of Women Voters was running a
perfectly good presidential debate

298
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,520
function but the presidential

299
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,200
a campaign so I mean the presidential
debates that they were running

300
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,260
allowed third fourth and fifth
candidates and they were

301
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,860
demanding that they ask questions that
were not provided beforehand

302
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,400
and so the republicans and democrats got
together they created a

303
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,060
debate Commission for two parties only

304
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,850
and they threw the League of Women
Voters out of the debate business and

305
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,630
the legal limit voters let them get away
with it

306
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,820
that is so wrong they should have raised

307
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,439
holy hallowed said no sex for a year

308
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,400
okay unless we get the presidential
debates back

309
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,130
that was a lock that was a lack of
integrity on the part of the League of

310
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,900
Women Voters

311
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,070
they let them get away with it and I
would like to see the League of Women

312
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,610
Voters which I do respect very much

313
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,490
get back into the presidential debate
business as well as governors and so

314
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,380
forth

315
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,830
in the back there sir question how do
you feel about the

316
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:37,370
educational system today and the job
training goes on as for

317
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,210
well yeah I i've reviewed weapons of
mass destruction by

318
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,670
dodi who got a teacher's award here in
new york is now retired

319
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,510
and orbiting the creative here ball and
so forth I mean our schools beat the

320
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,520
creativity of our children

321
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,480
and most of us are survivors at the
school system

322
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,820
where into rote learning memorization
I've useless old fax in fact in my and

323
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,960
my monograph on

324
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,920
on human intelligence I have this chart
and there's a literature on digital

325
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,340
natives it's actually

326
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,199
a book title and I'm even so forth weird
no you're not I'm a digital immigrant

327
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,230
okay my kids laugh at me on

328
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,300
but you guys are digital natives and
your children are gonna be

329
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,740
superpowers on so digital

330
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,240
immigrants like to teach to the book
have a school solution

331
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,220
everybody sits quietly in their share
its competitive

332
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,340
where is digital natives wanna be
entertained the one a multi task

333
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,360
%uh they want to learn what's useful in
the moment

334
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,140
they know how to search every trade they
want to do team learning

335
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,510
are they want to learn how to learn you
know we we bonnet

336
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,680
we've absolutely blown it and and if I
were God I think

337
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,500
the next president needs a secretary of
education intelligence and research and

338
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,820
we should strip the intelligence
community and use that the fun proper

339
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,260
education and research

340
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,040
and and and by the way I would I would
basically

341
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,520
eliminate the Boy Scouts but keep the
merit badges

342
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,280
a were right all right I've touched I've
touched an American icon

343
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,520
whatever the uniforms and then the
solutes

344
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,629
you know is that that's my Cub Scout
salute

345
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,140
okay know the merit badges are the
coolest thing on the planet

346
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,730
and I think every kid should have to
earn every merit badge before they go to

347
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,750
college

348
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,630
are and and we need to have a printer
ships in the traits

349
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,870
and we need to have apprenticeship said
the professions I mean if you can hammer

350
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,570
a nail

351
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,560
entered a screw you're useless to
society

352
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,290
okay what

353
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:59,290
of Facebook merit badge that's a
contradiction in terms

354
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,149
alright on II will go as long as you
guys want don't feel embarrassed about

355
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,600
being a non hacker

356
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,610
and going to bed up let's I

357
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,200
but you you have a tax question yes

358
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,320
so I have a tax question

359
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,439
in in don't boo me out of the room
leonard

360
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,230
there there's this guy on the radio
where I live in any syndicated

361
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,790
where do you live 11 Atlanta name your
boards

362
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,200
whose dead-set on this fair tax

363
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,950
thing which I see several flaws in but

364
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,020
E me give you if you read up on this
know and I'm not smart enough to make

365
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,340
tax policy I just know when we're being
screwed with it

366
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,800
basically the idea is that you go to a
flat tax on

367
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,710
a fight national sales tax like a VAT
and no corporate tax and

368
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,090
I just don't see how in the world it
adds up day

369
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,570
and be okay see you got money in the
bank when I get double taxed again

370
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,950
I just I can't see how

371
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,710
never change the tax system that we've
set up because

372
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,750
its though what is it that the first
isn't it the first or second largest

373
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,190
federal employer mean if you change the
IRS

374
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:22,830
you you Chris feat amass unemployment
problem well if you if you if you change

375
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,240
the IRS you eliminate a mass privacy
issue 2

376
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,250
up and and you know

377
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,520
the bottom line here and this is a good
opportunity kinda talk about capitalism

378
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,400
and then segue into

379
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,610
into how we organize the world on

380
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,710
capitalism was originally intended to be
in the public service

381
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,780
and Howard bloom is written a very nice
so very nice book

382
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,899
on on the genius of the beast

383
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,830
and it's about the reinvention of
capitalism and

384
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,629
and I recommend it highly on

385
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:08,630
see wary

386
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,560
here you go

387
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,669
I won't explode this is too complicated
but basically all my reviews are easily

388
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,150
available got a what you can do for me
as heck Amazon

389
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,050
and the voting system because they
they're pandering to the new people were

390
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,700
pissed off the guys like me have been
doing this since year 2000

391
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,050
and so they're now counting negative
votes and their deleting all 2 reviews

392
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,960
so if you like my reviews you can click
here

393
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,750
and that takes you to Amazon where you
can if you wish

394
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,050
vote for the review or against a review

395
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,620
as you please you can also do a comment
I'll check comments daily

396
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,680
and I engage in dialogue on Amazon

397
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,140
but Howard's book I guy named heart

398
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,130
is written a book called capitalism at
the crossroads Yannis just wrote a book

399
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,100
about social business

400
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,350
on essentially capitalism right now is
very badly organized at financial

401
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,430
capitalism shouldn't be allowed at all
are

402
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,680
because basically we've allowed Wall
Street to create fraud just like marine

403
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,950
strawberry strong is creating fraught
with the carbon think

404
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:26,480
that's nothing more then a subprime
mortgage for the earth

405
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,830
okay ok yeah it is it is absolutely

406
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,000
on so a

407
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,560
I think we need to re re fake capitalism

408
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,889
I personally think that this whole idea
asset accumulation is wrong

409
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,200
and that the indigenous peoples had it
right when they understood that

410
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,820
mother earth was for us the steward and
I'll recommend to your book call 1491

411
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,149
on which is about everything that the
mines in the ass text new

412
00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:00,040
before christopher Columbus they had
25,000 miles of paved road

413
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,220
they were doing deep fruit farming in
the Amazon that did not disturb the

414
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,440
Amazon

415
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,710
they kept the water clean and similarly

416
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,170
I mean and Peru in other places where
they've nationalize watered where

417
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,750
they're talking about pricing water and
stuff

418
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,910
the companies are complaining because
the indigenous people have learned how

419
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,000
to do an agriculture with drip
irrigation

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,830
they're not using enough wire it's the
wrong paradigm

421
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,149
okay so we've really me too regrouped
and

422
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,810
and grasp indigenous knowledge an
integrated digests knowledge

423
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,980
we need to take the profit out of waste

424
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,610
I mean PricewaterhouseCoopers did a
great study on health care and

425
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,610
demonstrated that

426
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,180
fifty percent of every health care
dollar is waste

427
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,680
and the reason that persists is because
we're not close plus system

428
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,710
with the profit is based on the totality
of the

429
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,510
expenditures and there is no incentive
for eliminating waste

430
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,710
are so this is a very very interesting
thing and capitalism and nations

431
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,650
statehood

432
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,390
go together McIver on the on the origin
or the function of the state is still

433
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,620
very worthwhile

434
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,950
reading and might wanna my masters
papers on the origin and failure to

435
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,290
state is also worth reading it's on 580
I owed under my early papers

436
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:21,030
on the bay this state is supposed to do
the things that are not worth doing

437
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,000
for corporations but are essential
services of common concern

438
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,680
that does not include ninety percent of
what the US government does

439
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,430
or does not do on so I do believe in him

440
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,920
sharply shrinking the government I also
believe a

441
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,940
in this this concept that the government
should not be spending money that is not

442
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,490
approved by the public

443
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,400
or by the congressional representative
said we've completely lost touch with

444
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,410
that i mean we cannot send the money and
then throw it away

445
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,510
on so going to the nation state now

446
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,280
we totally hosts Latin America and
Africa by creating artificial boundaries

447
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,100
does a wonderful book by Philip Allah in
phnom

448
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,240
out of Cambridge called the health
nations and what he talks about is how

449
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,890
these artificial boundaries

450
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,270
totally hosed indigenous arrangements
tribal arrangements that have been

451
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,250
developed over centuries

452
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,610
and so we actually created the seeds for
conflict

453
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,680
we created the seeds for tribal wars on

454
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,940
and we have also more often than not
empowered minorities

455
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,520
because the colonialism period tended to
pick

456
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,460
one also the group and elevate them to
become the

457
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,360
the the black englishman if you will and
so these minorities then became

458
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,100
profiteers

459
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,830
using government power to repress the
majority's

460
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,929
me if you look at iraq it was the
minority Sunnis

461
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,610
as officers and the Shiites as enlisted
guys

462
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,960
and I mean I had here two or four years
ago some passionate guy

463
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,750
from Saudi Arabia talking about how
government examinations basically

464
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,410
require Shiites to say that Shiites are
pieces of shit you should never be hired

465
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,200
and only sony's are really true Muslims
okay

466
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,220
yeah now run does the same thing he says
so so what we have here is a real

467
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,400
conflict

468
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,010
and and I personally believe that
diversity is very important

469
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,379
aren't we have destroyed over 2,000
languages

470
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,410
in the last forty or fifty years

471
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,490
we have five thousand secessionist
movements and a firework God I would

472
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,440
encourage every single one of them

473
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,030
up because the reality is we don't need
foreign ministries in all these

474
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,070
government bureaucracies and and and so
forth

475
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,360
most of life should come down to being
really really prosperous at the local

476
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,990
level

477
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,450
and self sufficient

478
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,460
yes sir wanna pick up on those the
session this comment

479
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,840
what do you think the Greek economy in
his there any chance the German is gonna

480
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,090
try to get out of the EU

481
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,900
I think that for the Greeks were really
screwed by Goldman Sachs which committed

482
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,410
a major crime

483
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,170
%uh as it has with other countries

484
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,960
on I mean those guys are lucky there not
being hunted down and killed

485
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,450
on because they have really host the
global economy

486
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,750
on I think germany should get out at the
European Union

487
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,470
on the European Union let me let me
rephrase that:

488
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,460
the European Union has been an
interesting success

489
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,680
but at the same time it has destroyed
diversity

490
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,570
and I'm not an economist but chuck's
penny publishes a lotta stuff from

491
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,480
economists on my website

492
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,430
not my website but the the public
intelligence blog site recommended

493
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:49,110
you've got a Dr you've got an option
here

494
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,520
%uh to you've got an option here too

495
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,510
a to select all of the stuff by six pany

496
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,650
I here you go headlines Spenny

497
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,350
67 there's a lot of economic stuff in
there

498
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,230
%uh but he was featured on time magazine
in the 1980s

499
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:15,010
as the first offense whistleblower know
and nothing has changed since then

500
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,370
so we we've got a real real problem are

501
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,850
I think diversity matters I think
national economies matter

502
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,490
I think national monetary systems are
part of controlling your own fate

503
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,580
%uh and establishing valuations for
yourself

504
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,159
on so I'm not an economist up but I've
learned not to trust economists

505
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,200
yes ma'am share darkness

506
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,450
I'm a man okay thank you on this week's
its bottom

507
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,850
owes waited half your thoughts on
special education

508
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,420
the over medication and education
students little thats disabled

509
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,840
when we could engage them if we taught
them to value deep rather than

510
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,410
service-learning

511
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,530
but did not because schools are teaching
to the test

512
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:04,110
others fear whose resources I i agree it
and I i admire

513
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,830
the people who go in the special
education I kinda have

514
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,340
it's like a three-part answer is number
one we really ought to do a better job

515
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,730
of not having retarded children and I've

516
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,430
not having children that are that are
basically

517
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,560
caused by severe problems in our whole

518
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,899
Lifestyle medical process the whole nine
yards

519
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,040
on so we're creating this problem

520
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,690
that's number one %uh number two i
believe in euthanasia

521
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,500
on and I think that there has to be a
reasonable process

522
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,920
forgiving people choices a between not
being burdened with a child that they

523
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,460
don't feel emotionally capable of
handling having that child go to a more

524
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,110
nurturing environment

525
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,020
on and certainly I believe an assisted
suicide or assisted passing

526
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:58,379
on by the way %uh al pacino does a
helluva job

527
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,640
in in the DVD on doctor death or
whatever it's called

528
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,830
arm what said you don't know jack you're
absolutely right

529
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,210
yeah it is very good and what are the
things that impressed me most is that

530
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,310
doctor kevorkian turned away ninety
percent of the people that saw his

531
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,550
assistants

532
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,950
mom pacino rarely does a a wonderful
wonderful

533
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,460
job of portraying the Stockton a very
responsible way

534
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,200
on and finally diversity really does
matter

535
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,880
and I mean look at Stephen Hawking I
he's the poster child for not killing

536
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,120
the retard

537
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,040
up because the retarded are often
brilliant at something

538
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,389
and so I really I put diversity into the
subtitle

539
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,830
my new book with great deliberation home

540
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,950
yet so I hope that kinda answers your
question

541
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,760
we'd under no I who hey I'm

542
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,879
ready for any question ought to arts

543
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I think to arts have a legitimate right
to be thrown for money

544
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,840
how whatever you could left in throw

545
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,240
how is that open source intelligence and
WikiLeaks different

546
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,620
all are always saying what is open
source intelligence and

547
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,569
with you eat also a our own compare
contrast

548
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,540
sherry I'll wikiLeaks is is mindless PA

549
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,279
%uh open source intelligence peas with
design

550
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,500
of

551
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,730
I i have a question regarding I mean I
can do more in open source intelligence

552
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,389
I don't mean to me that I've just spent
the last 21 years doing it

553
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,450
lover yes sir are going green technology

554
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,199
as far as I see a lot of a company I
love countries around the world are

555
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,389
all are all in all a gene that you know
global warming

556
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:54,649
is hopping on this so that the they'd
still raging I think the jones i'd have

557
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:56,270
community signed away

558
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,540
yes but let me let me interrupt them
you'll continue

559
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,520
number one environmental degradation

560
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,550
his threat number three from the
high-level threat town

561
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,980
global warming is largely a fraud

562
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,250
being funded by Murray strong so he can
do carbon credits and now pork and

563
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,140
double is 100 million

564
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,089
okay so global warming is actually a
pro-life

565
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,140
and in my opinion and it's certainly
something that should be taken seriously

566
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,549
but I'll tell you something sulfur

567
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,970
and mercury are vastly more important
than carbon

568
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,350
in terms of what we're doing to the to
the environment overall okay

569
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,330
so this is shady science shady politics
& really filthy money

570
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,060
go on from there that's actually
completely relevance to

571
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,779
when I was on a proposal that was that a
lot of these a

572
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,580
II studies wants to raise the war on
various

573
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,740
a mission levels that you cannot put it
I'm the max the

574
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,150
out on the street we were saying you
can't low-emissions

575
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,150
so saying that you can't I'll emit nice

576
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,250
as much and put these instructions so

577
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,020
by the the end up in a prison islamic I
think we would start doing this

578
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,210
information visit

579
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,250
France for example raises the bar I

580
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,720
on have restrictions on how what they
can omit a lot other businesses can just

581
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,790
jump ship to the next neighboring
country in Europe

582
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,670
unless all the countries at the same
time resolve some

583
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,730
8 you know what are the things that
troubles me I me for stuff biomimicry

584
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,060
is a huge answer here and I love the
Pioneers conference

585
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,350
on takes place once here on we now

586
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:37,200
know that bacteria is an energy solution
as well as a

587
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,430
anti-pollution solution are we're
learning huge things about amoeba

588
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,440
on and basically we've been ignoring for
fifty years

589
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,430
we have been basically sleepwalking %uh
while we destroy the earth

590
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,339
there's number one no reasonable

591
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,380
way to demand of China and Brazil and

592
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,190
Indonesian that they reduce their carbon
emissions

593
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:07,030
I would say fuck you believe you're just
like they have said okay now

594
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,130
number one %uh they already have

595
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,400
yeah they already have and they have
every right to do so however

596
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,550
as I try to stress in and in my

597
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,960
in my various briefings

598
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,040
the whole point of civilization is to
pass on lessons to other so that they

599
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,100
don't pay the price you've paid

600
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,360
to learn those last six and and I i

601
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,520
got that from will to ranchers 1916
graduate thesis is now

602
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,090
available as philosophy in the social
problem its orderly brilliant

603
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,860
and I've reviewed it if you want the
CliffsNotes on

604
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,520
and so I think really we should be
focusing on

605
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,560
doing holistic strategic analytics

606
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,070
we should be eliminating advertising

607
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,290
as a tax deduction we should be

608
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,450
eliminating all this plastic crap that
sells for five dollars would cost a

609
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,480
hundred dollars to create a

610
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,550
in oil and emissions and chlorine I mean
pandora's poison is a wonderful book

611
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,610
on our chlorine based the life

612
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:18,720
on and so I think rather than telling
them to reduce their emissions

613
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,050
particularly since they've got billions
of people more than we do

614
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,130
I think we should really be thinking
strategically about how do we help them

615
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,780
avoid our mistakes

616
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,820
had a wee how do we create

617
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:37,000
a living sustainable communities I think
sustainable design is is come a long way

618
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,140
on Cradle to Cradle all of this stuff

619
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,830
%uh the long and the short of it is the
only thing we have to offer them or not

620
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,900
offering

621
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,860
and that is reasonable alternatives %uh
so I think it's time we start spending

622
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,380
a lot of money and a lot of time on
reasonable alternative starting with

623
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,630
biomimicry

624
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,990
and starting with eliminating all that
crap that we shouldn't be making in the

625
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,160
first place

626
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,580
its best I can do yessir I like to ask
you about been

627
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,980
the twilight zone over of the US
government

628
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,580
you know what can you tell us about the
mk-ultra

629
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:22,360
was was it was mk-ultra the LSD tennis

630
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,790
it happened for I mean you know me
either the stand that that

631
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,980
it this mentality and frankly you really
have to understand that there too many

632
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,880
nazis

633
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,320
that that helped create CIA mom

634
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,750
and and that whole attitude is is
pervasive and and when I told my Kate he

635
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,320
was

636
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,840
absolutely wrong to go into rendition
and torture of course he ignored me

637
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,310
but the fact is it was wrong are

638
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,560
rendition and torture are terrible evils

639
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,759
on and Abu Ghraib is the poster child

640
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,360
for why you don't want to go and
directions like that

641
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,530
because this stuff inevitably comes out
it inevitably comes out that we've

642
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,330
killed an Italian waiter

643
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,770
are instead of you know whoever it is we
were looking for

644
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,400
and there are so many books on the
imprecision and ineffectiveness

645
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,140
National Intelligence I just I guess
what girl

646
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,470
won't go there now have lost my train of
thought I get there on

647
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,580
no no no no no no rigid nazis 00 nazis

648
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,779
I let me tell you about acoustic eighty
a

649
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,130
I mean CA put a video camera KK

650
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,640
and they took it out for a a test drive
and

651
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,330
it saw another kitty cat he ran across
the street govern over

652
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,310
okay i me Elio we do lots of cool stuff
but the problem took

653
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,990
cook told batf so fundamental problem

654
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,600
in national intelligence is that we have
substituted technology for thinking

655
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,420
okay and that's been one of my sound
bites for a long long time

656
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,869
I'm gonna beg your indulgence I have got
to go to the bathroom

657
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:07,430
%uh I mean it's the price I pay for this
stuff but now I'm awake

658
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:14,430
so I will come back highly-charged and
will go with you and then with you sir

re-air

665
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,680
you know I think I think this conference
really needs a serious upgrade

666
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,029
in technical reliability in

667
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:53,090
across the board yes sir

668
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,460
simple question Dick Cheney and
cross-dressing

669
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,130
your balls um

670
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,880

believe that my source

671
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,100
is the single most incredible bisexual
in our world

672
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,740
and that when he says dick cheney is a
cross-dresser

673
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,110
I have to believe it I

674
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:28,110
another another simple question hillary
clinton vince foster tour false

675
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:36,190
%ah you know there may be occasions when
she lowered her standards

676
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,850
alright day in the back there please
remember that I can't see

677
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,720
arm why do we see a change in tactics
for the

678
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,550
up the intelligence intelligence
community basically and more

679
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,790
specifically the V

680
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,830
Israeli Mossad arm the

681
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,580
last operation and and Dubai was carried
out in broad daylight

682
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,700
people smiling and into cameras I
recently the flotilla arm

683
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,990
actually attack on the ship on the up
volunteers

684
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:12,970
was also in broad daylight everybody was
watching

685
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:18,000
exactly and arm so white why is that
happening and what's the

686
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,020
is there is there any purpose for having
these operations done

687
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,450
you know in front of the whole world
well we hit we have some distinguished

688
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,480
narrow surgeons and cycle

689
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,840
analytic personalities here the audience

690
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,740
a who could help us with that %uh it so
I invite them to come forward if they

691
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,540
want to comment but I'll give you my
take on it

692
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,259
%uh israel has become the nazis on

693
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:49,200
and they've lost their mind and the
United States government is following

694
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,390
them right up that trail

695
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,509
the idea of both up building palestinian

696
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:59,890
ghettos after Dundee said that Palestine
is to the palestinians is Francis to

697
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,180
france

698
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,868
is just to me incomprehensible and it is
genocide on a massive scale

699
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:10,910
on and I personally

700
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,589
I'm very upset that the US taxpayer pays
twenty percent of the israeli budget

701
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,730
and I'm also personally upset that we're
giving

702
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,330
tens and hundreds of billions of dollars
in military assistance that the arabs

703
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,390
who haven't done jack shit for the
palestinians

704
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,040
and so I think it's time we actually
have an intelligence-driven foreign

705
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,100
policy

706
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,440
%uh and

707
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,430
well the arab sex sleaze bags in their
own way okay and I'm really talking

708
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,580
about the dictator snot that not the
bottom up people

709
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,740
on I'll why haven't the arabs done
anything for the palestinians

710
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,869
I believe that the Arabs are racists and
that the palestinians so they're black

711
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:54,700
people

712
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,990
on and they were really really treat
them like shit and get their gots people

713
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,960
just as much as Israel X

714
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,480
arm so I think we really need that look
seriously at Palestine

715
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,780
I've also noticed though what are the
books that are 8-1 on the books that I

716
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,720
reviewed which

717
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,869
II was stuck in Dallas site finished my
serious books ahead by two books and

718
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:15,960

00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,759

729
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,900

book on bureaucracy which talks about

735
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,509
different things and and I recommend it

736
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,420
completely alright let me get down
because one other things that

737
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,119
that really impresses me is that the
Palestinians have controlled

738
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,680
%uh the sea for the lower southern half
of the israeli coastline

739
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,960
since time immemorial and Gaza is
actually

740
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,850
a containment above what has been a
historical

741
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,368
palestinian I'm sorry there's just so
much stuff that gets loaded on this

742
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,380
website

743
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,980
you really have to almost navigated

744
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,070
or visited daily if you want to keep up
which

745
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:57,500

by the way if you do a search for my

747

759
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,619
dangerous combination

760
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:48,099

Afghan from below this is Lee

764
00:48:01,259 --> 00:48:03,369
felsenstein who invented the PC

765
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:06,619
is a member of hackers in

766
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:11,880
Silicon Valley damnit I'm sorry I've
lost it but anyway this this book on

767
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,640
on Biblical maps shows and basically
what we need i think is a two-state

768
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,359
solution

769
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,569
all and also the israelis are delusional

770
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:24,579
I mean they are going into minority
status here big time

771
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:28,739
and I think the day's russians
pretending to be choose to get outta

772
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,959
rusher over

773
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:35,180
%uh so day there's this there's this
really issue here and and I think they

774
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:35,739
just

775
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:39,400
I and also by the way the Middle East is
all about water

776
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,799
and the israelis have been stealing
water from Arab what aquifers their

777
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:45,569
agriculture is up fifty percent of the
water

778
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:50,190
and it produces four percent of the GDP
okay and so they're really kind of

779
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:54,279
sucking up water from multiple countries
to pretend that they're making the

780
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:55,190
desert green

781
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,119
meanwhile someone else is gone and
turned the debt seek greater

782
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,099
these people have gone into the Dead Sea
they have restored all of the ancient

783
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:07,089
knowledge which is why focus so much on
indigenous knowledge

784
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:12,680
they free restored the Faroes and
they've managed to capture every single

785
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,509
raindrop that falls over the course of a
year are there now raising lemon trees

786
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:17,369
and fix

787
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:22,130
in the Dead Sea that's what we should be
doing for

788
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,719
okay so over here and then we'll go back
over there

789
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:28,829
and on that note have you I this is your
third time so

790
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:32,199
I i'm gonna really ask that this be the
last time because I love you

791
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:35,309
being energetic but i wanna get some
most people in the back corner

792
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:39,729
okay diving seducers have you seen or
read if not definitely check it out

793
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:43,739
what series ringing Cedars series no 79
bucks

794
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:48,489
I'm covers a lot of topics I'm solutions
so I will just have one man

795
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:52,109
so many books so little time

796
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:55,779
%uh ya where we were being blessed

797
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:58,829

798
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,400
I thought he was gonna moon me okay yeah

799
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,140
yes doctor doctor I wanted to comments
on

800
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,729
what that persons commenting about the
reason why Scott

801
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:14,049
arab governments not helping
Palestinians is really simple reason

802
00:50:14,049 --> 00:50:17,759
they don't want to because helping the
palestinians is not in their best

803
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:18,369
interest

804
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:21,920
they're using the issue a palestine and

805
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,519
the plight of the Palestinians to foment
arm

806
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,719
fragmentation among the Arab world and
it helps them stay in power

807
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:34,170
if they were to actually do something
positive if peace were to break up

808
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:37,999
god forbid they would probably be
overthrown within five years

809
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:41,259
both thank you lol and

810
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:46,140
I just wanted to ask you if you look at
your friend up there as a human being

811
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,598
is action that want that one person has
actually suffered a stroke and he's

812
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:51,509
drooling up

813
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:58,509
quarters now which corner

814
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:03,579
thank you very much

815
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:06,589
I

816
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:10,180
killed a pig go Vegas hip

817
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,109
with what said

818
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:18,940
million own a tale it is a wonderful
book

819
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,119
called the average American in this
journal is spent two years

820
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,390
going all over the United States looking
for the average American

821
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:31,009
and a year and a half into the project
he thought he found the guy in the

822
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,049
interview too many told by the pride
itself

823
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:37,089
he was so impressed he went to a says if
this guy doesn't call me

824
00:51:37,089 --> 00:51:40,509
in the next six months he's the average
american in the guided

825
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:45,150
you know I mean no no no no no no he
treats me the way I do if they don't do

826
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,119
their fucking homework I'm not gonna
talk to them

827
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,990
are so um so he goes back

828
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,770
and this guys grilling and he says hey
you're the average American

829
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,859
and the guy says wow what an honor

830
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:02,420
I had goosebumps over that common

831
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:07,779
because the average america's American
has got more integrity and more brains

832
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:08,049
than

833
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:13,759
or heart that anybody in washington that
is an elected or appointed official and

834
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,930
that's what's wrong with this country's
the average americans have lost touch

835
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,970
with power gonzo

836
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:27,849
now I just haven't /url to find but the
problem is

837
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:32,130
Nana these guys have broken out up this
part is senator

838
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,960
concept okay loyalty

839
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,559
to a partisan line is

840
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:43,750
death up for america okay sir

841
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,549
with other problems in greed and
corruption of the right now in your

842
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:47,140
opinion

843
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,450
which government were of country music
is on the right path

844
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,260
not the Nordics hands down followed by
Iceland in the Netherlands and Singapore

845
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,440
which is kinda gentle authoritarianism

846
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,400
by the way in Singapore you can't be
elected unless you first have an MBA

847
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,270
I'm serious for

848
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,329
but said here

849
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:13,680
the sale for schools are very good

850
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,190
and the people in Singapore do their
homework

851
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:22,130
you know I'm I'm a little upset with my
kids because it's kind of like

852
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:25,869
the generational thing on

853
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:31,109
I I was very lucky I I had american
schools overseas which are really just

854
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:33,200
one step down from prep schools

855
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,849
that really make you work as opposed to
prep school sick just prepare you for

856
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:37,789
gentleman CA

857
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:40,930
Gail on and

858
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:47,450
my voice have chosen to be hackers and
to be very very lazy about schoolwork

859
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:50,470
and I think it's a real credit to my

860
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,000
to my oldest son that he got into the
Rochester Institute of Technology on the

861
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,190
merit of what he learned outside of
school

862
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,539
on and so I I obviously love him

863
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:03,220
no matter what he does click link that's
a future

864
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,140
huge accomplishment that that he did
with me

865
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,538
not being anywhere around as a decent
father so I'm

866
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:15,720
I'm just very pleased about that on go
go on in the back please

867
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,000
in Norway a there's a seed bank

868
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,900
leaving rockefellers Monsanto
archer-daniels-midland

869
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,210
Gates Foundation is put together Force
Band and she's

870
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:32,589
against that she says you know seeds are
best stored in the earth

871
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:37,328
and a bank where they can create more
killer seeds you believe that this is

872
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:38,880
tied in with her

873
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,279
the eugenics movement it's a very
provocative question I

874
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:49,150
number one my understanding that the
seed bank

875
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,609
was that it was actually trying to
preserve original seats not meet

876
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:53,470
concedes

877
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:58,299
on and I am absolutely a post

878
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:03,400
to anything that that is essentially a

879
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,740
regression in Earth history

880
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,880
and that's what one sent to its on

881
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,730
think

882
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,609
I mean they literally are setting this
back thousands of years

883
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:22,180
on and and I think we should well we
should put them out of business

884
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,540
on and but

885
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,250
well

886
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:33,119
I don't know one other things you could
do is start shipping decency

887
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,150
two were India I mean I don't know but
but

888
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,079
I do believe that one billion rich
people can bring $5 billion poor people

889
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,180
up and bypass the corporation's ok and
that's why the

890
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,520
at the end of my book I have a global
range of gifts table

891
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,829
and this is all about 121 giving micro
giving

892
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:55,059
exact giving precision giving with no
intermediaries other than those at

893
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:56,359
volunteer

894
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:03,359
to help with language FedEx whatever

895
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:09,240
well they the question is how do you
bypass the parasites that the change

896
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,109
and I think I had a slight

897
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:19,569
I that show that this is frozen

898
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:25,009
okay here we go I mean look at this
there are no parasites in this chain

899
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,220
are hearing number one

900
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,410
this guy needs a new part this it's
amazing how many

901
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:34,770
and the US is really totally screwed up
the rocker been a lot other stuff they

902
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,210
brought in was 1950s 1960s trucks

903
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,500
okay that there's some other needed to
crack tutored but

904
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,910
%uh this guy needs a new part for
nineteen fifties remaining water pump

905
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:50,279
so this person a passing tourist text
that need

906
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:56,180
into a database okay unicef is still
some remarkable things with with the SMS

907
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:00,849
call rapid SMS and rapid SMS can fill a
web back office

908
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:03,960
which can then visualize the information
okay

909
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,170
so that goes into a database a rumanian

910
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:11,589
with national pride says hey we no
longer sell their partner mania but I

911
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:14,710
can't make it on the late in my garage
in almost engineers have

912
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:18,359
late in their garage least the ones I
know on

913
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:23,598
and so he makes it and then he says but
I can't pay the Fed Ex and so a German

914
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,279
comes in and says hey this is cool

915
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:29,250
I'll pay for the FedEx and it goes down
here and then a Spanish courses are

916
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:29,869
delivered

917
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:34,619
not post a picture there are no
parasites in this change

918
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:38,400
it's one to 10 resistance okay

919
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,960
on and I was thinking of something else
and I i forget

920
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,279
on I'm getting all

921
00:57:47,279 --> 00:57:50,480
Alzheimer's or whatever by the way
alzheimer's they think is mad cow

922
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,710
disease it's been met

923
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:55,950
misdiagnosed on and have you seen where
we're

924
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,259
this what's this what's this the

925
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:02,630
is that there's a disease that they've
just realized is actually something

926
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,020
that's caused by blood

927
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:08,490
that blocks the brain and if you really
if the blood pressure on the brain

928
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:13,470
it's like ms. for yeah I mean it's just
amazing what we're learning

929
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,380
and and a big part of the problem is
medical schools have become

930
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,040
bureaucracies and they've sold out to
the pharmaceuticals

931
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,220
has so they've stopped learning on

932
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,319
my doctor no longer reads medical
journals I was given ship to one of

933
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:28,509
these publishers

934
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:32,359
because they're publishing crap thats
been written by pharmaceuticals and

935
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:33,808
signed by someone who's been

936
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:39,400
paid to sign the article

937
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,630
stop doing drugs %uh

938
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,869
I

939
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:50,500
well you know I gotta tell you

940
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,509
I gotta tell you I have a real problem
with

941
00:58:53,509 --> 00:58:58,259
up with a

942
00:58:58,259 --> 00:59:01,529
%uh it seems like a date is not go by

943
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:04,869
that the pharmaceutical industry doesn't
invented you

944
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:08,170
disease you know like TCI p

945
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:12,039
you know or or if or or or

946
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:15,779
yeah an hour or whatever you're
suffering from our I'm not taking enough

947
00:59:15,779 --> 00:59:17,150
drugs syndrome

948
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:20,299
%uh you get off okay it's crazy

949
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:23,710
%uh K

950
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:27,369
yeah no no no no it's not the more on
that they're worried about it's the fact

951
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:29,190
you're not taking enough drugs

952
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:33,109
okay through okay come on over here

953
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:36,750
and then we'll go back there lot said

954
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,839
I'm I do a lot of biology I work with
our

955
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,660
surrogates Rockmart humor in this but
there is what a good medicine out there

956
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,589
like this store

957
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:48,650
there as an education is information
overload missing

958
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:52,200
some these things you told Mark Bittman
suspected for many years

959
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,720
the cancer vaccines it was twenty thirty
years ago the

960
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:01,259
was story suspect as tools me I take use
it. for computational biology

961
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:06,509
and we're come across these some stuff
is happening information ordinary area

962
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:09,730
space mean I i respect for you on a
buyout

963
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:14,630
no I I respect what you're saying but I
also have seen too much documentation of

964
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:15,960
patents being withheld

965
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,319
is all sorts yeah i i working actually
looking

966
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:23,240
were but they put on the couch was what
works what I would put to you is that

967
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,630
we're probably half way where we could
be if we had integrity

968
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:30,859
everywhere okay I for sure everywhere
okay so the bottom line is let's get

969
01:00:30,859 --> 01:00:33,069
integrity back into the system

970
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:36,799
on still of distillate information
overload

971
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,329
yeah but this is Ian hey there let's
talk about information just so then the

972
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:42,799
IT how many stupid people are out there

973
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:47,829
mean we should be ok over this with your
office or mace we did twenty thirty

974
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:48,609
years ago

975
01:00:48,609 --> 01:00:53,279
yeah out but but we went in the wrong
direction we we hand out a what Bill

976
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:55,720
Gates has been a cancer in many ways

977
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,359
%uh not least because he's been mutating
APIs for the last thirty years just to

978
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:01,930
set up Tolbert's

979
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,980
on the alternatives are coming I mean

980
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,690
we actually seek instead a Photoshop
means our grandparents

981
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:13,750
yet but whatever its you know things
things will change

982
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,190
here

983
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:21,540
actually some these these Lexus
Strasburg me whatever happened to do

984
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,380
custom install or whatever happened

985
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:28,190
seen what's happened in the case I wanna
got damn black rotary phone

986
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,759
that I can dial you know I mean this is

987
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:34,680
this this stuff should be eighty approve
can you guys see this sorry let me try

988
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,759
and do this what is it f5

989
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:42,329
function f to just talk for just a
little monitor picture or chrome laptops

990
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:48,660
change here

991
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:55,129
for fullscreen

992
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:58,609
recharges your

993
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:02,549
is it now I'm not sure no I O the
graphic I'm sorry I can't make the

994
01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:04,049
graphic the first screen

995
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:07,160
your I'll keep control plus re:

996
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,819
control person is just now to keep the
position are you switch screens again

997
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:16,940
are you can you see the drool

998
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:23,099
I then I'm afraid we can't make that
into a big screen because it's just a JK

999
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:30,099
control plus in the modern browsers
enlarges the whole modern browsers

1000
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:34,839
I just took my parents to Best Buy

1001
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:38,640
and I felt I was like one evolutionary
step behind them

1002
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,390
yeah this yeah this is just that

1003
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,980
let's keep you think you getting larger
font

1004
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:49,489
well I'll down on let me just let me
just go on from here this was this was

1005
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:50,309
created

1006
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,920
and this was created by dick cleveland's
a brat ashford

1007
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,569
tickets just absolute genius and he's
got lifetime rights to the is set to the

1008
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:02,750
scientific information citation analysis
database

1009
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:07,470
on and he's created some remarkable
stuff but this is actually

1010
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:11,739
the Web of Knowledge and this is the
fragmentation the sciences are up on top

1011
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:16,520
in the humanities are down below and
social sciences gone out to lunch

1012
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,950
on but cognitive science

1013
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:24,079
and collective intelligence are the
scientific a humanity side up bringing

1014
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,000
all this back together

1015
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,319
and coming back to your comment
technology where we have failed as we

1016
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:31,739
haven't done the processing

1017
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:35,790
the United States intelligence community
process is less than two percent of what

1018
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,109
it collects

1019
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:40,900
okay I mean NSA's numbers as of ten
years ago

1020
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,460
46 percent other russians 3 percent of
the Chinese 1 percent off everything

1021
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,380
else

1022
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:51,420
on all know because then you couldn't
pay SAIC to fuck it up

1023
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,210
I know I know and and again it comes
back to integrity

1024
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:59,290
the directors have NSA have not had
integrity

1025
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:02,720
and I particularly include lieutenant
general alexander

1026
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,239
who'll killed able danger

1027
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:10,170
because it revealed to the 9/11 people
beforehand and what I found is a

1028
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,989
government lawyers when they don't know
they say you shouldn't do this

1029
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:17,770
and so he had bad lawyers and he had a
particularly stupid SCS that I knew it

1030
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,869
was a GS 12 which you should never have
risen beyond

1031
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:25,049
are and so general alexander literally
did not do what he should have done

1032
01:04:25,049 --> 01:04:27,759
which is termed the information over to
the FBI

1033
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:32,489
on and and so this is a lack of
integrity

1034
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:36,660
alright in the back sir actually had two
questions

1035
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:42,239
now the first one is what are some
fictional books you might recommend

1036
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,509
if there are any bulletproof

1037
01:04:45,509 --> 01:04:50,160
and also bulletproof is it's it's a real
stuff

1038
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,000
and have you heard about the Italian
doctor who found

1039
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,609
that certain cancers were curable from
baking soda

1040
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:04,470
I know but I believe it and and this is
the thing that really for us me

1041
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:09,380
there is so much knowledge in the world
and it's not being disseminated

1042
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,759
I mean we have concentrated wealth and
fragmented knowledge it should be the

1043
01:05:12,759 --> 01:05:14,119
other way around

1044
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:18,099
mom and and soul this is the kinda stuff
that

1045
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:22,529
I'm hoping that a whirl brain would
create a virtual world health thing and

1046
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:25,589
you know I love Larry brilliant but but
anybody and

1047
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:30,940
its surface I use to love but anybody
that will sell out to Google

1048
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:36,759
%uh is is got a problem up because
school has no interest in making sense

1049
01:05:36,759 --> 01:05:38,279
school wants to

1050
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:41,420
basically own your information and sell
it back to you

1051
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,170
on and I recommend the books by Steve
Arnold

1052
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:50,059
yes sir what are your thoughts on
national sovereignty

1053
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:54,750
and will given the new economy obviously
where things are you are crumbling or

1054
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:59,450
doing getting stale what are the borders
going to look like or they can be

1055
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:02,710
what they are presently a movement of
the last 50 years and how do you

1056
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,960
envision them changing in the next say

1057
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,119
510 well let me answer that three levels
number one

1058
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,869
individual sovereignty is absolutely if
you're

1059
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:16,869
keeping your integrity and one other
problems we have is too many people are

1060
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:22,099
sacrificing their integrity to authority
that is of questionable value

1061
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:25,619
and so that's number one number two %uh

1062
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:31,239
the state does serve a very good purpose
in terms of order and conservation and

1063
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:34,040
economies of scale and certain other
things however

1064
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,950
the state gets dysfunctional when it
tries to manage what it doesn't

1065
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,250
understand

1066
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:43,390
and that we've reached that point we've
been at that point since the 1960s

1067
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:47,569
on so I believe that some states will
survive

1068
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:51,640
but I commend to your attention the book
by Joe Carroll called the nine nations

1069
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,359
of North America

1070
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:59,710
absolutely actual excellent book on how
we logically nine nations

1071
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:03,690
all right go Cascadia there's also
salmon nation

1072
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:08,400
there's a fish that wants to dominate
you love

1073
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,250
air have a serious you know and and and
finally oh and by saying that

1074
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:17,500
so many of the borders that we imposed
on Africa and Latin America should just

1075
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,430
go away

1076
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,529
they just make no sense at all and we
also have to look at the whole issue

1077
01:07:23,529 --> 01:07:27,660
Australia's now struggling with the
whole issue of native land rights

1078
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:32,680
and the we need to get there the native
american indians unfortunately they

1079
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,089
decided the booze and gambling was a
fair tradeoff

1080
01:07:36,089 --> 01:07:39,859
for their cultural heritage I don't
think it was that good a deal

1081
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:44,150
absurd

1082
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:48,420
I yeah I mean all these embargoes the
3ds effect someone just wrote a cookbook

1083
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,540
called Invisible War

1084
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:53,739
I mean that killing five hundred kids in
iraq was worth it

1085
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:56,989
or run killing five any kids in Iran was
worth it what could it

1086
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:01,680
idiot would say that well madeleine
albright Hillary Clinton

1087
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,650
you know I mean this is this is the kind
of people that think that this makes

1088
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,020
sense

1089
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,690
because they lack a solid ethical and
philosophical foundation and they've

1090
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:17,690
lost their integrity

1091
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,339
get in the back

1092
01:08:21,339 --> 01:08:25,099
one thing that I had heard around the on
the internet was that

1093
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:29,670
arm that the intelligence community
wasn't really after

1094
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:33,230
nation Elgin screen is always been
around after

1095
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:36,310
trying to get the terrorists trying to
attract al Qaeda

1096
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:39,609
nice effort several sofa military people
here actually

1097
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:43,089
saying that the game comino the dates
when those are guys actually want them

1098
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:44,929
to start doing on nation-building

1099
01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:48,190
but the touchscreen jealousies
resistance signs his supporters turned

1100
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,910
lol its it's not just the

1101
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:53,309
it's not just the intelligence community
entire military-industrial complex

1102
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:54,560
because nation-building

1103
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,000
doesn't pay as much for doing less

1104
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,729
are you actually have to build the
nation you're held accountable for

1105
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,830
results

1106
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:05,299
%uh we had a chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff it said real men don't

1107
01:09:05,299 --> 01:09:07,649
do operations other than war

1108
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:12,620
and one of the problems that we have is
that the US government is dysfunctional

1109
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:17,130
I mean DOD is dysfunctional but at least
they can move shootin' communique

1110
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:22,380
are and there's a whole new me know
about whole-of-government at all this

1111
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,000
the department to stay the former
commerce all these other departments

1112
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,549
they can't search

1113
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:32,238
they don't have a Foreign Service they
have really fat bureaucrats in

1114
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:35,089
Washington and spend half their time on
the internet

1115
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:38,120
me one other things I found in a unit
that I'm working with this we have to

1116
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,439
turn off facebook and youtube

1117
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,099
I mean we actually have to shut them out
or we lose 30 percent productivity

1118
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:50,259
on and and this is even in Guatemala

1119
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:54,660
in this particular unit so

1120
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:58,389
for I've lost my train if I can but this
is scary

1121
01:09:58,389 --> 01:10:02,160
mad cow disease now I don't know I don't
know

1122
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,580
come back bring me back where worry
we're talking about

1123
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,360
tude oh okay yeah you know

1124
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,809
part of the the I mean the dark cabal
was buckminster fuller's number two is

1125
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,400
now a

1126
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,560
a a guru in his own right he runs a big
picture small world

1127
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,120
he's a master love a a sustainable
design

1128
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,449
workshops and and people start out in
the small group in about half way

1129
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:31,460
through the design workshop they have
the Ohio experience a

1130
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:35,540
oshit we have to all come together and
be a system of systems

1131
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:41,099
think tank okay on and the guard has
costed out what it would take to solve

1132
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:42,150
every problem

1133
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:46,080
on the face of the planet are clean
water disease every

1134
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:50,170
230 billion dollars well we in the
united states are spending

1135
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:53,929
1.3 trillion dollars a year

1136
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:57,080
ought the instruments of war

1137
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,489
not even on being competent at war just
the instruments of war

1138
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:05,250
so what you have here is just total
total disconnect

1139
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:09,090
between reality and as senator sam nunn
used to say

1140
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:12,199
you really have to understand the threat
and then you have to have a strategy

1141
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:15,349
that within that strategy designed for
structure

1142
01:11:15,349 --> 01:11:19,370
and then with that for structurally then
design a campaign plan and so forth

1143
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:24,090
the single best dollar on the planet is
in the education of women

1144
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,920
and one of the things that the

1145
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,090
really and one other things Michael
Hamlin spot a half penny on the dollar

1146
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:33,500
is is excellent

1147
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,670
and he's one of the guys I think this is
a clear thinker

1148
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:39,710
on even if he is a democrat on

1149
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:43,360
and job for one other point say

1150
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,769
Janos makes is that lending money to
women

1151
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:51,030
is like 10 to 15 times more effective
than lending money demand

1152
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:55,830
on and that's actually fascinating and I
i have myself found that women make

1153
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:57,099
better analysts

1154
01:11:57,099 --> 01:12:00,520
because they have smaller egos and your
intuition

1155
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,020
so this there's there's a lot of stuff
we can do right in the future

1156
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,370
did you have a follow-on visited axiom
very quickly

1157
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:10,719
the that wall since we're already in
Afghanistan

1158
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,260
I mean I guess were I'm Iraq war seems
to be our

1159
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:17,410
seems the wrapping up for these the
council down about the SSPX

1160
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:21,050
is a bit as clearly recently now if you
were

1161
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,810
if you could have been injured what
would you have done differently and you

1162
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:24,550
think we should

1163
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:28,580
leave Afghanistan as is now do you think
we should are emboldened

1164
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:32,179
kinda like obligated to on finishes
nation-building

1165
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:37,510
and stabilizer for stuff we can afford
to fix it now

1166
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:41,790
arm and we broke it worse than it was on

1167
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,790
you know Charlie Wilson died recently
but

1168
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:48,040
the Charlie Wilson was one helluva
congressman

1169
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:54,010
and and I it's really amazing how far
handsome drunken texting

1170
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:57,910
get if he's got his heart in the right
place and Charlie Wilson had his heart

1171
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:59,530
in the right place

1172
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:03,219
I highly recommend the DVD and the book

1173
01:13:03,219 --> 01:13:06,739
which or my review of the book when we

1174
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:10,639
drove the soviets out love a Afghanistan
a canopy

1175
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:14,290
the the backstory on Charlie Wilson is
that CIA

1176
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:17,900
never wanted to actually do what we did
in Afghanistan

1177
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:22,489
they wanted to just harass the soviets
and Charlie Wilson came in and said

1178
01:13:22,489 --> 01:13:25,679
bullshit we're gonna drive the soviets
out and we did a

1179
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,250
on unfortunately 200 over stinger
missiles are now in Iran

1180
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:33,969
and job you know we made a lot of
mistakes along the way

1181
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:38,739
but when we drove the soviets out both
Afghanistan Charlie Wilson went to

1182
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:42,800
the congressional committees and said
let's just stay in the funding level but

1183
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,170
redirected to schools and roads and
water which happens to be a particularly

1184
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:48,400
desperate problem in Afghanistan

1185
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,410
and they said no okay so

1186
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:56,000
we blew it right there on and finally

1187
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,760
what are the problems we have is is
we're so screwed up here at home I mean

1188
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,050
we've been exporting jobs

1189
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:06,670
we've got major policy issues i mean
population issues that we're not dealing

1190
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:10,050
with we've got major water issues power
issues

1191
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:13,219
transportation issues a health issues

1192
01:14:13,219 --> 01:14:16,790
agricultural issues on if I hit

1193
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:22,090
been in charge after 9/11 I would have
said shit

1194
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,540
imperialism just came home to roost

1195
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:28,860
and maybe what we should do is pull back

1196
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:33,070
I mean I personally think that line is
right in many respects and so does

1197
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:34,460
Michael sure

1198
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:39,110
or any read my reviews Michael sure its
books imperial hubris and so forth

1199
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:43,769
we should not be supporting at the spa
Nick regime of 60,000 princes many of

1200
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,050
them perverts

1201
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:49,160
%uh who kidnap young starlets from the
United States for fifty thousand dollars

1202
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,160
on a byname basis

1203
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,540
%uh missus to ridiculous %uh

1204
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,570
so bin Laden has a point

1205
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:01,049
and we missed the point %uh so

1206
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:05,980
from where I said Afghanistan at this
point cannot be saved

1207
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:09,469
because what we have done is we have
aroused every national

1208
01:15:09,469 --> 01:15:12,510
xenophobic bone in that country

1209
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:15,889
we have put a corrupt asshole in charge
his

1210
01:15:15,889 --> 01:15:19,610
warlord drug lord brother is feeding him

1211
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:24,380
sheesh %uh at the same time that he's
running opium in the Pakistan

1212
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:29,080
and and this is a no win solution I mean
the biggest single most important word

1213
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,730
with respect to insurgency
nation-building is legitimacy

1214
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:36,670
the United States of America has 0
legitimacy in Afghanistan

1215
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:40,710
because the Afghan government has 0
legitimacy in Afghanistan

1216
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:47,020
in my opinion

1217
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:51,760
what the israelis or what

1218
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,500
know so the Americans in their own way
so the Americans and don't don't

1219
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,730
misunderstand me I love her aunt's

1220
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:00,730
I love Howard blown who's a

1221
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:04,880
was a zionist hun

1222
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,030
a.m. looked israelis gonna have to come
to grips with the fact that

1223
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:12,969
their building walls their building
ghettos I mean if you go into Israel

1224
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:16,389
and you look at the Jewish settlements
with roads and soccer fields and

1225
01:16:16,389 --> 01:16:19,260
swimming pools and you look at the
palestinians right next door

1226
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,800
who are incidently Israeli citizens

1227
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,739
I'm sorry but that is a crime against
humanity

1228
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:33,290
okay ok up please do

1229
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:38,030
how is it different you know you talked
about

1230
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:41,530
Native American

1231
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:45,309
you know you form a nation 26 used move
over

1232
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:49,099
make your resources

1233
01:16:49,099 --> 01:16:53,260
you know what what is your suggestion
when dealing with

1234
01:16:53,260 --> 01:17:00,260
protected secure people

1235
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:07,190
there secure would your

1236
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:11,380
each what are the problems that did

1237
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:16,070
that Israel faces is it i mean it's like
general Custer's last stand you know of

1238
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:19,150
we've got the enemy right where we
wander all around

1239
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:22,510
%uh you know a day going to work

1240
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:26,300
mom baby the

1241
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,010
look I mean on a military officer I'm an
intelligence professional

1242
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:35,139
and I have I taught the UN class before
one on

1243
01:17:35,139 --> 01:17:40,020
and open source intelligence in beirut
in August of 2007

1244
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,889
what israel has done to Beirut is a
crime against humanity

1245
01:17:44,889 --> 01:17:48,449
on and it is absolutely intolerable to
me

1246
01:17:48,449 --> 01:17:51,599
on it is bad military judgment

1247
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:54,690
is collective punishment it is in

1248
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:57,880
every sense of the word in the Nazi
tradition

1249
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,639
and building walls around specific

1250
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:06,599
villages is so insane as to cause me to
wonder what kinda citizen would support

1251
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:08,050
a government that does that

1252
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:12,250
anybody okay I'm sorry it's wrong

1253
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:18,010
now what you have going for you is that
the roster trials are still in power and

1254
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:22,010
there is a jewish to ask for %uh that
has powered every country the world

1255
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:27,410
and I would focus on that

1256
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:30,880
8 the Guadalupe Hidalgo line

1257
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,820
is gone get used to it okay now

1258
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,840
I think that all kind exhorted fans
trading

1259
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,190
one of the questions from before moving
to a situation up anarchy

1260
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:46,510
can turkey is the opposite anarchy

1261
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:51,320
K panner key is when you can have
multiple loyalties

1262
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:56,210
okay and you can be a rich and vibrant
member of the Jewish community without

1263
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:58,170
being a traitor to america.

1264
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:01,870
I mean I'm talking ideal american not
the government of America

1265
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:05,960
%uh you can't be a yarn

1266
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,349
I mean you can be any one of a number of
diversity group and be

1267
01:19:09,349 --> 01:19:13,739
part of the the sense-making and the
judgment at all that

1268
01:19:13,739 --> 01:19:17,360
and you do it because you have clarity
and diversity

1269
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,679
and integrity alright because what's
what's

1270
01:19:20,679 --> 01:19:25,130
the problem that I am finding with most
governments and most organizations

1271
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:29,429
is that they're becoming Colts like and
I certainly include every religion in

1272
01:19:29,429 --> 01:19:30,510
America

1273
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:35,370
okay and so they become cult-like and
you have opus day doing crimes against

1274
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:37,300
humanity and you have the more minutes

1275
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,410
basically stealing shit outta CIA and
the FBI

1276
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:44,349
on and you have of course the islamic
radicals

1277
01:19:44,349 --> 01:19:48,860
doing very bad things and I'm frankly
astounded that the Americans are so

1278
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,098
naive

1279
01:19:50,099 --> 01:19:53,679
I mean steve emerson is it is a good
friend of mine and and he was

1280
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:57,150
blacklisted from journalism in 1994

1281
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:00,550
because he did an undercover PBS
one-hour documentary

1282
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:04,230
on the Mons an American soil calling for
the murder of americans

1283
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:09,050
and FBI didn't want to touch religious
freedom I mean we literally have a

1284
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:10,590
stupid government

1285
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:15,030
on and it's not still be because the
people are stupid it's still a bit

1286
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:19,199
because we have a bureaucracy that is at
the end of its life I mean it's walking

1287
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:24,980
get stupid on with politicians who
really don't wanna smart bureaucracy

1288
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:29,380
and that's the problem that we have and
and with respect I think we have to

1289
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,940
confront the truth the chairman to
such-and-such in Japan says

1290
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:36,389
no matter how ugly it is until you get
the truth to the table

1291
01:20:36,389 --> 01:20:39,860
you can't deal with it and I think the
Middle East is

1292
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:43,679
is a place where we should be able to
wage peace

1293
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,980
and frankly howard blume a global brain
has the answer

1294
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:51,270
by the time every palestinian and every
israeli kate is five years old they

1295
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:56,130
know is an absolute fact communicated
directly from the our way

1296
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,330
that the other guy is a monkey on a pig

1297
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:04,280
okay and that's wrong so I would occupy
the Middle East

1298
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:09,009
for fifty years and I would raise an
entire new generation

1299
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:12,780
that learns to live in peace and that
applies our tax dollars for peace rather

1300
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,840
than war

1301
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,989
on okay

1302
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:21,980
yes okay let's go back to you guys by
the way you'll notice that I have to pay

1303
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:25,309
more and more frequently as we move
toward six o'clock

1304
01:21:25,309 --> 01:21:29,679
up but stay with me on

1305
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,449
I actually thought about doing this
apple juice urine thing on you guys but

1306
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:36,550
decided it was too much trouble

1307
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:39,750
good go on you mentioned that a

1308
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:43,870
to 130 billion would solve the world's
yeah actually have a slight on it let me

1309
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:45,679
try and bring it up go ahead

1310
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,170

01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,860
interpol interval let's not go there %uh

1368
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:38,860
okay next tell this amid target bill has
a book is mine

1369
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,940
I think something just fell for

1370
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:47,950
are alright minorca bill has been
struggling with the book

1371
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:53,030
called seven billion billionaires but
he's done some work done this before an

1372
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:53,969
article for

1373
01:25:53,969 --> 01:25:57,179
and I highly recommend it like four
billion billionaires

1374
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:00,260
sorry on okay is this thing on

1375
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:03,860
yeah but I'm not talking to you yet mine
or my listening my bad

1376
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:07,580
okay are soma dark put this together

1377
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:12,290
and he gave me permission to use it but
its absolutely utterly brilliant

1378
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:15,429
and I don't wanna waste your time
looking for the slide but if you pull

1379
01:26:15,429 --> 01:26:18,250
this Jay pagan put it on a power point
slide you can

1380
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:22,210
you can look at it in detail or you can
actually look for

1381
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,610
army

1382
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:29,410
did I'm sorry sure my my batter

1383
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:32,639
sure

1384
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:37,389
I'm I'm I word I

1385
01:26:37,389 --> 01:26:40,780
I'm not worthy know I know where the eff

1386
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,320
got Wow control plus arm

1387
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:49,530
anyway this is really very very
intelligent stuff it's been rigorously

1388
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:53,599
documented by Matt dart I have absolute
faith that his numbers

1389
01:26:53,599 --> 01:26:57,750
on the fact is that we're reaching the
point now

1390
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:01,349
where are s enough people just say no

1391
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:05,570
on we might actually get some common
sense and the government

1392
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,880
on and I really am

1393
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,610
torn because on the one hand I wanna be
a good law-abiding citizen and on the

1394
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:14,268
other hand I think

1395
01:27:14,269 --> 01:27:19,340
that we are very close to needing to go
on a nationwide tax revolt

1396
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:22,910
and and so I don't know what the answer
is

1397
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:26,200
don't come to the microphone and then
we'll come to you in the back

1398
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:30,780
up but but this guy up for many many
reasons

1399
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:34,460
has to have sorry pride of place no no I

1400
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:38,150
wasn't gonna hang on hang out how will
come right back to go

1401
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:41,190
every government has a life cycle

1402
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:44,950
at a certain point in the over a life
cycle over government the government

1403
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:47,059
starts to becoming self-serving

1404
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:50,340
and its primary interest is the service
of the government and not have the

1405
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,130
people

1406
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:54,290
for which it was designed and developed
server so

1407
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:58,219
let's assume for a moment that we did
have a day of protests let's assume that

1408
01:27:58,219 --> 01:27:59,780
there is some kind of

1409
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:03,030
who were tea party that spreads out
across the country in Port Richey party

1410
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:05,989
I love it

1411
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:10,660
the great see if that's a copyright term

1412
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:15,870
couldn't tell me that hehe i like it
okay let's assume that there is a public

1413
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:21,320
insurrection resurrection whatever you
want to call it the US air action

1414
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,710
I'm sorry I'm trying to wake up the guys
in the back okay I me

1415
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:28,269
right now I'm a distraction to the okay
go i'd

1416
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:33,239
what with the government's response be
if they felt that their control

1417
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:36,889
over the populace through taxation

1418
01:28:36,889 --> 01:28:41,950
and federal state government legislation
and various other kinds of things

1419
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:45,920
Gandhi I i watch that video like

1420
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,160
once every two months nonviolent

1421
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,950
non-violent resistance

1422
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:57,170
protest the government day you know

1423
01:28:57,170 --> 01:29:02,370
part if part of what I've learned the
hard way is you have to give people

1424
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,179
a back door and one of the things that I
really believe strongly

1425
01:29:07,179 --> 01:29:10,380
is that you have to wind the government
down slowly

1426
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:15,330
I mean the last thing you want to do is
put

1427
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:19,170
to me I don't know how many million
civil servants we have most of them

1428
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:22,090
double wides

1429
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:25,860
but you the last thing you want to do
and Hannah

1430
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,018
in an economy that has 22 percent
unemployment

1431
01:29:30,019 --> 01:29:33,040
is put the federal government not to
work

1432
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:38,280
okay that's not cool but what you can do
is have a ten year plan

1433
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,679
that downsizings the government by 10
percent every year

1434
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,000
and that basically is really is is I've
learned I have to tell us the

1435
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,780
congressman is

1436
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,230
is jobs and revenue neutral district by
district

1437
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:52,860
okay so what I'm really talking about
here is not

1438
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,620
flipping the system but actually

1439
01:29:56,620 --> 01:30:00,080
migrating the system in a very
intelligent way from its current place

1440
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:00,480
to

1441
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,880
future place and the idealistic

1442
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,900
vision that I have is it if enough
people

1443
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,139
start saying this will not stand and say

1444
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:14,700
we prefer this then we might actually
get what we want

1445
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,710
on right now the government is dangerous

1446
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:24,360
to itself and two box it is really
hurting the world it is really hurting

1447
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,820
us there's a wonderful book called The
50-year-old

1448
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:30,880
love by Leeper

1449
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,849
Derek Lee Burke I think believe our he's
a very noted military historian

1450
01:30:35,849 --> 01:30:40,730
I mean the soviets didn't have any air
defenses in the north until we started

1451
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:43,380
running strategic air missions into the
North

1452
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:46,580
a fresher to see how far we can get

1453
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:49,639
okay I mean is the TV ATSC

1454
01:30:49,639 --> 01:30:53,070
of what the united states government has
done in our name over the last 50 years

1455
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:56,049
is just beyond comprehension and their

1456
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,820
it's a burden for me too afraid all
these books %uh

1457
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:04,290
because I ask myself why does everybody
else read all these books

1458
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:08,910
as I get very frustrated because it's
all there its all in the opener

1459
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:13,239
but what we have not been given is the
tools to do sensemaking together

1460
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:17,760
and the tools to aggregate and visualize
citizen opinion

1461
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,820
and that i think is the next big step in
that was one of the slides and my

1462
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:27,170
in my briefing which you can which if
you go to a Phi Beta iota

1463
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:31,729
anytime on you will find

1464
01:31:31,729 --> 01:31:35,200
you will find the previous is great
geriatric

1465
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,570
web sites okay mom

1466
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:44,179
this this lecture packing humanity okay
so if you click on this

1467
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:48,250
it's the briefing that has the words and
it notes format so sure you've been very

1468
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,370
patient in the back

1469
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:54,150
go ahead thanks I'm not a citizen of
this country but I read a book while

1470
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:55,320
those in cuba

1471
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,870
called the collapse of complex societies
and we keep talking about

1472
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:03,519
where america's going from here in the
United can only imagine if

1473
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:07,229
based on everything you read that you
actually have read that one and

1474
01:32:07,229 --> 01:32:11,040
you know it's fine that we talk about
where maybe America should go

1475
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,160
again another citizen here so I can only
kinda observer

1476
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:19,570
but are we have against the collapse of
a complex society here and if so

1477
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:24,429
what's next how do we reverse the
geriatric think

1478
01:32:24,429 --> 01:32:28,420
control mines Hughley

1479
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:34,820
for this is just too cool

1480
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:41,040
few

1481
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,800
all right now the pluses on the top so
that's a little harder

1482
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,280
edge what

1483
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:53,500
here control 0 I'll you clever Devils
you move did

1484
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:59,979
hood up K know I've had enough education
for the day I can't take this anymore

1485
01:32:59,979 --> 01:33:03,250
okay a den here hold on

1486
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:07,790
down here troop

1487
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:11,960
called on holder be patient speaks our

1488
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,960
cart complexity in catastrophe 68 books

1489
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,190
complexity and resilience 87 books

1490
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:23,290
and I probably have read that book and
what it boils down to

1491
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:26,679
is real time feedback loops

1492
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:31,550
okay government is incapable of
real-time feedback loops

1493
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:35,809
and government is in cable love seeing
the whole system

1494
01:33:35,809 --> 01:33:39,550
and that guest review that I provided on
bureaucracy in there

1495
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:43,090
but one of the top academic some
bureaucracy

1496
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:46,800
essentially says that one other problems
with bureaucracies

1497
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,610
is that they continue to acquire
interests

1498
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:54,009
and basically it's like adding on you
know it's like you start out with the

1499
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:55,710
Toyota then over time

1500
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:59,639
it turns into a take and you wonder why
you can't get it to get to the

1501
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:01,170
supermarket lesson

1502
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:05,179
1,000 gallons okay and so that's our
government

1503
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:09,670
and so what turns out to be really
really import

1504
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:13,120
for resilience in the face of complexity

1505
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,989
is distribution be and bottom

1506
01:34:16,989 --> 01:34:20,070
up sensemaking and bottom-up alerting
and

1507
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:24,690
and all of this stuff and so really what
we have right now is a central

1508
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:28,070
government at the end of its life

1509
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:33,340
and yet we have not gotten the local
governments

1510
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:36,380
to any point of coherence or integrity

1511
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:40,450
%uh and it may well be that we see
secession I mean Hawaii is poised to

1512
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:42,389
secede from the union

1513
01:34:42,389 --> 01:34:45,870
are they manage to get an apology from
the US government

1514
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:50,590
into the Congressional Record which
essentially is an admission by the US

1515
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:54,130
government that they invaded and
occupied home why it gets the wishes of

1516
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:54,979
the

1517
01:34:54,979 --> 01:34:59,469
the hawaiians I meet Sarah Palin if she
had a little bit more smarts would have

1518
01:34:59,469 --> 01:35:00,650
state governor

1519
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:04,519
alaskan then become president of alaska
and made the Yukon and Northwest

1520
01:35:04,519 --> 01:35:07,429
Territories an offer they couldn't
refuse

1521
01:35:07,429 --> 01:35:12,479
okay are

1522
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:15,519
make the Yukon and Northwest Territories

1523
01:35:15,519 --> 01:35:18,750
here I a

1524
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:23,599
I alright go once our place

1525
01:35:23,599 --> 01:35:27,320
um the one feeling I get from love talk

1526
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,469
from people about you know black
centralized government

1527
01:35:31,469 --> 01:35:35,239
is that it should be all about you the
lower-tier people

1528
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:39,860
ruling the country and I think a lot of
times you arm

1529
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:43,219
like many similar to reflect the the
populace in general

1530
01:35:43,219 --> 01:35:46,160
if the people who are against you know
people who were going to universities

1531
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,429
and having PHD's

1532
01:35:47,429 --> 01:35:50,870
the you know the whole Tea Party
movement saying you know I don't think

1533
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:51,630
that's right

1534
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:54,389
just because they have a degree your you
know this because I have a master's

1535
01:35:54,389 --> 01:35:56,700
degree they should be ruling the country

1536
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:00,599
or the one thing I had to say those the
love this message that you're being

1537
01:36:00,599 --> 01:36:05,330
spouted is coming from corporations were
basically doing the same thing

1538
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:09,239
but in the corporate fashion and a
what's your view on that

1539
01:36:09,239 --> 01:36:13,389
the fact that the corporations are just
trying to use the populace

1540
01:36:13,389 --> 01:36:17,340
in some sort message that
anti-government when in fact it's the

1541
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:21,099
way we you know eat on the way %um
future

1542
01:36:21,099 --> 01:36:25,190
love you know ownership by the
corporation tells me my

1543
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:30,760
you know my pension solid I i think
you're right and and corporations can be

1544
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,030
trusted even less than government

1545
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:37,280
forgive me I have to scratch my back

1546
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,679
this is now my swagger stick as well you
know it doesn't make

1547
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:45,500
up arm

1548
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:49,110
with this is the intelligence collective

1549
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:54,150
and that's like sixty eight books in
here on hidden wealth of nations

1550
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:59,050
global Shareef you know this is Tom at
least I love them he introduced me to

1551
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:00,650
the whole Seattle

1552
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:04,400
mindset I tried to get my wife to move

1553
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,559
apart from the fact she works for the
CIA in his five years to go to

1554
01:37:07,559 --> 01:37:10,000
retirement she said

1555
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,790
tidal waves earthquakes

1556
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:16,870
and rain which okay

1557
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:20,200
fuck you know my head brains

1558
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:24,650
spirit heart okay living universe anyway
there's a buncha really

1559
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:27,780
good books the you can just flip through
here on this

1560
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:31,599
intelligence collective its it's really
cool this was very special

1561
01:37:31,599 --> 01:37:35,739
90 the logic if you meant by the way if
you go to this website

1562
01:37:35,739 --> 01:37:40,489
and you just wanna see the cream at the
cream go to six star special

1563
01:37:40,489 --> 01:37:44,050
94 out over 1600 book reviews

1564
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:47,360
okay and just work your way down through
those 94

1565
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,719
and you've got what I think that this is
very interesting this is a movie about

1566
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,260
america's torturing Americans

1567
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:56,780
and it said almost eight sacks split

1568
01:37:56,780 --> 01:38:00,639
between the people with brains to like
my review and the people without brain

1569
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,080
to think anything goes

1570
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,969
America love it or leave it on and it's
quite remarkable

1571
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:11,630
day %uh you'll have to read it

1572
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:15,769
%uh it was a it was a good review I mean
it was a every view that talked about

1573
01:38:15,769 --> 01:38:17,670
the meaning of the film

1574
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:22,120
on and one other things it's so really
frightening

1575
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:25,960
is the degree to which ignorance

1576
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:29,429
serves as a foundation for
authoritarianism

1577
01:38:29,429 --> 01:38:34,280
I mean if you're really really ignorant
you can think you're really really right

1578
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:41,280
and not be

1579
01:38:41,929 --> 01:38:45,360
well I personally have foundered

1580
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,830
that torture does not work torture

1581
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:51,929
causes you to chase false leaks

1582
01:38:51,929 --> 01:38:55,160
stewart harrington colonel who was one
of the top

1583
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,370
counterintelligence guys in the US Army
ran a prisoner interrogation

1584
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:03,170
thing on an island off the coast of
Panama and

1585
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:06,179
he treated them like human beings with
great dignity

1586
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:10,019
and his record has never been equaled
for actionable

1587
01:39:10,019 --> 01:39:14,019
verifiable intelligence okay in Iraq

1588
01:39:14,019 --> 01:39:17,820
we sweep through neighborhoods and pick
up fifty people

1589
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:21,969
and they go to a novel Rob and spend
months

1590
01:39:21,969 --> 01:39:26,920
before someone finally gets around to
them and then eventually releases some

1591
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:31,639
I just previewed a book called The
surrender to kindness

1592
01:39:31,639 --> 01:39:36,790
which is about Afghanistan and it's a
remarkable book

1593
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:42,070
it's almost like a silent spring for how
we interact with foreign cultures in

1594
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:46,460
and how we how we used the wrong tool

1595
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:50,410
surrendered a kindness it'll it'll be
released at the end of August and

1596
01:39:50,410 --> 01:39:53,630
it's really quite a special book why do
we have to

1597
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:57,830
test that every couple generations when

1598
01:39:57,830 --> 01:40:01,530
even as far back as the Romans they knew
that

1599
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:06,460
torture does not produce good quality
intelligence

1600
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:09,809
I've struggled with that for many years
and and

1601
01:40:09,809 --> 01:40:15,380
I really keep going back to wilder ants
book philosophy in the social problem

1602
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:20,320
on other things that Plato said which
which duran points out

1603
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:25,040
is that the highest Minister of the land
should be the Minister for Education

1604
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:28,500
and George will his done a book I've
collected articles that talks about

1605
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,150
statecraft as Soulcraft

1606
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:37,550
okay we lost our sole the United States
of America gave it up

1607
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:41,309
after world war two we're on the right
track with the Marshall Plan

1608
01:40:41,309 --> 01:40:46,250
on and then we let CIA go crazy with
Nazis and too much money and gold

1609
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,870
certificates and

1610
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:52,500
and Italian Japanese and German
politicians on our

1611
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:55,570
CIA payroll and basically

1612
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:59,009
it became fashionable for CIA to

1613
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:03,190
basically fuck around wit had no right
to be and so the clandestine

1614
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:08,150
tale started wagging the analytic taught
to the point CIA lost its mind

1615
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:12,130
mom panetta got all of my books I know
panetta was gonna be appointed a week

1616
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:13,550
before came out

1617
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:17,360
and I got all my books to limit is
Institute I make sure that they were

1618
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,110
delivered

1619
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:21,540
and the box was open each's

1620
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:26,450
completely pull it off and he was
perfectly suited as a former director of

1621
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:27,190
OMB

1622
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:30,960
and as a former chief of staff for the
white house to actually know what the

1623
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,400
president needed to know to be effective

1624
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:37,660
and predator fell for the deal blowjob

1625
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:41,739
they just sucked him right and forgive
the analogy

1626
01:41:41,739 --> 01:41:45,239
he's lost his manhood CIA they have just

1627
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:48,389
the him up you know that really is kinda
graphic

1628
01:41:48,389 --> 01:41:54,469
but anyway that's the fact mineta lacks
balls in his dick has been cut off

1629
01:41:54,469 --> 01:41:58,700
yes sir so i i think you might have
started by dad top five books

1630
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:01,700
your reading list that we should all in
this room walkway

1631
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:06,420
read this the two for sale outside

1632
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,330
the signatures to you writing money the
signatures our the muddy

1633
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:14,059
know I know that I know that and and the
Booker being sold the costs to me 20

1634
01:42:14,059 --> 01:42:16,489
bucks for on intelligence and

1635
01:42:16,489 --> 01:42:21,309
and 10 bucks for the new one which are
very pleased with Dom

1636
01:42:21,309 --> 01:42:25,489
your aunt I would say you know what two
out of the five would be duran

1637
01:42:25,489 --> 01:42:30,849
the first one is so his philosophy in
the social problem the second one is the

1638
01:42:30,849 --> 01:42:32,479
lessons of history

1639
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:35,870
and one other things he says and lessons
of history is that morality has a

1640
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:38,849
strategic value beyond price

1641
01:42:38,849 --> 01:42:44,019
and that's actually right home and this
isn't about the Pope's divisions because

1642
01:42:44,019 --> 01:42:47,519
I mean we have a close eye Nazi pope

1643
01:42:47,519 --> 01:42:51,190
now and we've had Pope's in the past
that have

1644
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:54,389
that have did brutally vicious

1645
01:42:54,389 --> 01:42:57,870
authoritarian against liberation
theology which was actually one of the

1646
01:42:57,870 --> 01:43:02,110
best ideas the Jesuits have had in the
last century

1647
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:05,870
liberation theology could have saved
latin-american participatory budgeting

1648
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:06,820
and Brazil

1649
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:10,070
which the Brazilian government chose to
ignore so

1650
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:13,268
certainly durant's philosophy the social
problem

1651
01:43:13,269 --> 01:43:16,700
and and Durant will and Ariel Durant

1652
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:21,210
lessons of history on

1653
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:26,260
the other three

1654
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:32,210
is that a name of a book

1655
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:38,050
well you know i i I like cologne I like
koon in part because his point is that

1656
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:42,769
until nothing makes sense the old
paradigm survives

1657
01:43:42,769 --> 01:43:46,219
and what are the problems that we've had
is that people have been very very sick

1658
01:43:46,219 --> 01:43:49,280
lax about questioning the old paradigm

1659
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,719
and so we've kinda been letting people
go along with solution I mean this is

1660
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,010
famous quote from

1661
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:57,950
from the white house where someone is
trying to say but reality is

1662
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:01,000
and and someone possibly rover cheney

1663
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,519
is saying oh you must be one of those
reality people were an empire we make

1664
01:44:04,519 --> 01:44:06,309
our own reality

1665
01:44:06,309 --> 01:44:13,309
well for I was I would what

1666
01:44:13,769 --> 01:44:19,940
had the dumbest best on the planet okay
on according to general franks

1667
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:25,250
well trotsky like to say and I saw this
quote it offers booked on

1668
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:29,150
or an anti-war trotsky like to say you
may not be interested in war but war is

1669
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:30,900
interested in you

1670
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:34,710
and so I like to say you may not be
interested in reality the reality is

1671
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:36,320
very interesting You

1672
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,620
for okay so you gotta get a grip

1673
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:44,559
and I think it's irresponsible if the US
government to ignore reality

1674
01:44:44,559 --> 01:44:48,960
and I think it's irresponsible of us to
let it get away with ignoring reality

1675
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:52,690
and frankly I think we should drive
every got damn congressman

1676
01:44:52,690 --> 01:44:56,309
out of office for having gone along

1677
01:44:56,309 --> 01:45:00,739
with all of this now the Senators we can
only get rid of one-third of their

1678
01:45:00,739 --> 01:45:07,739
but I think we should literally flush
the Senate and the House down the toilet

1679
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:12,120
and I i pause so that someone can make
that YouTube thing tomorrow

1680
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:17,250
on I think ideas on how

1681
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:20,570
cutter I wouldn't be here

1682
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:26,900
up but if no know you know I've actually
I've actually conceptualize getting some

1683
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:30,389
people together and creating a Google
map of the earth

1684
01:45:30,389 --> 01:45:34,190
and then having a a a planet where

1685
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:39,950
at a certain moment in time a million
tires are set on fire in exactly a

1686
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:41,110
spatial

1687
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:44,170
locations that spell enough

1688
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:48,030
with an exclamation mark running from
San Francisco to New York

1689
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:54,739
on that would be pretty cool so organize
their

1690
01:45:54,739 --> 01:45:58,570
1 okay

1691
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:05,570
next arch what's

1692
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:08,880
well instead of the five books when he
read of 1600

1693
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:14,250
my reviews and and then when we meet the
two years you could tell me what the

1694
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:15,590
five books are

1695
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:20,139
a big hun

1696
01:46:20,139 --> 01:46:24,179
you know yeah I struggle I mean he
really Durant

1697
01:46:24,179 --> 01:46:28,469
duran really shines wilder and

1698
01:46:28,469 --> 01:46:31,950
is just an amazing human being and and

1699
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:34,969
his wife was obviously a saint

1700
01:46:34,969 --> 01:46:38,489
but what they accomplish with their
history of civilization which I have not

1701
01:46:38,489 --> 01:46:40,000
read

1702
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,059
but I've read kind of the capstone stuff
has been absolutely phenomenal

1703
01:46:44,059 --> 01:46:47,760
and I would say philosophy in the social
problem hands down

1704
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:53,170
the first book lessons of history the
second and I really struggle to name a

1705
01:46:53,170 --> 01:46:56,000
third fourth and fifth

1706
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,540
but somewhere in there it's all about
collective intelligence

1707
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:02,580
and you know there's this whole
literature was the crowds groundswell

1708
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:05,910
here comes everybody every viewed all
those books

1709
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:10,300
and what it boils down to is no one
person has it all

1710
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:14,269
and we've got to learn to think is a
community and and that's my definition

1711
01:47:14,269 --> 01:47:16,469
of Goddess community

1712
01:47:16,469 --> 01:47:20,219
so ma'am you have a question

1713
01:47:20,219 --> 01:47:24,239
question questions about Obama's
citizenship for now even in the national

1714
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,030
enquirer in the grocery store

1715
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:29,429
would have you heard of him giving up
the citizenship there

1716
01:47:29,429 --> 01:47:33,599
when he was adopted as a child by his
stepdad

1717
01:47:33,599 --> 01:47:37,210
highway have heard a great deal I cannot
stay

1718
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:42,250
with with certainty but I'm fairly
certain that his citizenship was given

1719
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,620
up on his behalf

1720
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:47,380
by someone else on and I'm fairly
certain

1721
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:51,989
that %uh there something going on into
why that's been heavily paid for

1722
01:47:51,989 --> 01:47:58,989
on I'm fairly soon

1723
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:29,690
on

1724
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:36,690
alright I've been asked to keep going on
what it what it boils down to for me

1725
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:42,769
because I mean look at george bush the
stuff about bush

1726
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:46,900
and the Bush family that did not come
out

1727
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:50,830
is basically an indictment of the media

1728
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:55,290
as a controlled press and even the in
the media's in the world were not able

1729
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:59,510
to make a dent in counter-punch and so
forth too few of us read those

1730
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:04,450
and and there is no I really love this
whole flash mob thing I really like

1731
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:08,700
real-time Twitter intelligence I've got
a slide in your graphic

1732
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:12,610
on Twitter I can now see where everybody
is and basically

1733
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:16,260
ask a specific person via Twitter what
do you see

1734
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,900
I here's a quick true story just stream
of consciousness when the

1735
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:24,600
when clinton ordered a missile to hit
the Libyan intelligence centre the

1736
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,520
intelligence community could not tell
him whether they had hit

1737
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,870
and so unbeknownst to them he called the
presidency and then who called the CNN

1738
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:35,099
bureau in Jordan recalled a photographer
that they knew lived across the street

1739
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,060
from the Libyan intelligence centre

1740
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:40,800
and he said he had spurning okay

1741
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:47,520
are for that's kinda a statement on the
complete inadequacy of the US

1742
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:48,930
intelligence community

1743
01:49:48,930 --> 01:49:52,500
and the marvelous capabilities of
independent

1744
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:56,590
verification and somehow we're just not
getting it together

1745
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:59,740
on you know you guys server

1746
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:03,410
you guys are small spike

1747
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:06,930
I mean this is a spike theory of change
which is you don't try and raise the

1748
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:07,940
whole society

1749
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:11,980
just kinda pop a little spike up but
then a little spike comes in

1750
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:17,590
eventually the whole thing on I

1751
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:21,420
bottom line is I'm an optimist I believe

1752
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:25,680
that were getting close to a turning
point I'm really concerned about the

1753
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,260
cell phones hurting the bees

1754
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:30,900
up but at the same time I think you're
going to end up having

1755
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:35,690
not only cellphones but local grids
where we make our own power

1756
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:39,570
you know buckminster fuller
conceptualize the electric grid for the

1757
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:40,420
entire world

1758
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:43,850
that is really well laid out for

1759
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:47,350
and I it's just

1760
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:51,790
maybe we need to crash in order to

1761
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:57,670
move on mom and I regret not selling
both my properties in washington won the

1762
01:50:57,670 --> 01:50:58,820
market was at its height

1763
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:03,690
in and I read the long emergency

1764
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:07,260
and I said %uh I'm gonna sell out in

1765
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:10,400
and moves and my wife said the fuck you
are %uh

1766
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,670
here self EA

1767
01:51:13,670 --> 01:51:18,890
its kinda tough a and other questions or
comments overs I think

1768
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:22,560
you personally the problem is couple

1769
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,720
abortion is another savers who threw the
switch correlates the

1770
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:30,790
be colonies diminishing with actually
american farmers

1771
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:33,840
changing over two morow should say

1772
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:37,260
on plants that these docents

1773
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:41,310
2004 when I love it I love it and I
absolutely

1774
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:44,840
agree that that's kind i mean we have to
do holistic analysis

1775
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,010
I'm not even talking about like it the
alter plans although no I'm with you

1776
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:52,190
yours yours bottom basic plants out
there like very Osama

1777
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:55,850
they're not getting the high that their
use to

1778
01:51:55,850 --> 01:52:02,140
your yeah I know I'm I'm completely with
you and and that's where biomimicry in

1779
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:02,740
the whole

1780
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:06,880
real time science and holistic
understanding in all this has to come

1781
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:07,600
into play

1782
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,900
I mean it's I almost feel like we've
just been bored

1783
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:14,440
and and humanity is just kinda popped
out at the Shell

1784
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,090
and and worn out the beginning love

1785
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:22,930
being a conscious species barber Hubbard
is done Barbara Marx Hubbard who by the

1786
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:24,150
way it was the other

1787
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:29,700
vice-presidential candidate with
geraldine for our so she's done a book

1788
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,760
conscious evolution and she has a

1789
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,720
DVD and emergent so did you wanna say
anything else to other things on this

1790
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:40,820
want your opinion on the whole
nonproliferation lot the

1791
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:44,920
countries around the world up free
snacks was before I mean

1792
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:48,180
but I if anything this situation iran is
kinda

1793
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:51,580
at least seems to me right now it's
gonna be inadequacies

1794
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:56,590
it's like is kinda having a big part
with nobody I don't see any way we could

1795
01:52:56,590 --> 01:53:00,700
that we could stop Iran or any the other
countries in developing without

1796
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:04,330
warned I don't think the issue is work
going world

1797
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:08,150
so I scuttle I'm kinda I'm at the
question myself

1798
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:11,370
what is the nonproliferation and of
course

1799
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:18,370
doctors with your first a sit-down

1800
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:24,870
gonna actually I was gonna wear a suit
for you guys

1801
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:29,630
the

1802
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:30,280
there we go

1803
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:34,380
thanks forever house after

1804
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:38,980
okay arm there's a there's a number for
up comments on make first off

1805
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:43,070
the most serious proliferation problem
on the planet a small arms

1806
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:46,269
I'll followed by the sale of military

1807
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:50,040
are spy all of the permanent members to
the National Security Council

1808
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:54,930
up the I'm sorry for the UN Security
Council the United States sells five

1809
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:56,880
times more arms in russia does

1810
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:02,690
are followed by the United Kingdom and
then China we're hypocrites

1811
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:07,120
and that should stop we should

1812
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:11,070
certainly have a very strong military

1813
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:16,380
we actually need for military so big war
military a smaller military apiece for

1814
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:17,180
military

1815
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:20,280
and a home more military but

1816
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:23,840
we should not be arming other nations
that's just plain don't

1817
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,730
are and however much we may

1818
01:54:27,730 --> 01:54:30,840
argue that if we don't do it someone
else will

1819
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:34,200
I think we will be stronger if we

1820
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:38,130
place our emphasis on building peace

1821
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:42,050
capability your was actually more
nuclear nonproliferation hours

1822
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:45,510
I am with you there's more nuclear and
hospitals

1823
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:49,290
yeah then we have any clue about I'll

1824
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:52,620
I mean during the Olympics are big fear
was the University of Georgia nuclear

1825
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:53,300
reactor

1826
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:56,570
which just would've made it fantastic
birthday cake

1827
01:54:56,570 --> 01:55:00,130
you know so

1828
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:04,790
II I think the whole proliferation thing
is oversold and I think one of the big

1829
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:06,110
problems we have

1830
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:09,680
is that is that Iran has a perfectly
legitimate

1831
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:13,430
right to not only have nuclear power but

1832
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:16,480
we gave Pakistan brzezinski

1833
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:19,500
gave Pakistan the SUNY nuclear bomb

1834
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:23,740
a run doesn't give a shit about the
United States they're able to suck us

1835
01:55:23,740 --> 01:55:27,160
into taking out Iraq and Afghanistan
anytime they want because they know

1836
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,000
we're stupid

1837
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,400
okay they're scared shitless about Saudi
Arabia Pakistan

1838
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,470
wiping out the shiites okay

1839
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:40,660
so I would focus on making sure that
there was clean energy available for

1840
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:41,330
everyone

1841
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:45,970
that there was clean water available for
everyone on and I would focus

1842
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:50,280
on you know Ron Paul has this foreign
policy of peace and

1843
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:54,750
and commerce up so

1844
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:58,670
for me proliferation is largely a waste
of time

1845
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:03,010
and we have no business talking when we
can't even count their own nuclear

1846
01:56:03,010 --> 01:56:04,690
missiles and we lose them

1847
01:56:04,690 --> 01:56:06,490
when they cross the country
