1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,100
the and attacks are just repeating
themselves over and over the years

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:11,030
drunk so

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,469
I've been thinking about this talk in a
subject for a while and there's two

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:15,750
reasons I wanted to give it

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,550
the first I'll give you now and the
second reason to give you at the end

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,930
when

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,990
it'll make more sense on I see a lot of
familiar faces an ally new ones and I

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,289
know that because your help

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,019
you are on you share some personality
characteristics with me

10
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,360
you love puzzles and black boxes you
never believe

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,719
anyone who says there's only one way to
do something and you love the latest and

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,480
greatest

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,540
the newest other not just attack but the
knowledge arm

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,239
I have I take actually

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,690
a bitter personal pride in the fact that
I know stuff that other people don't

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,160
know

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,640
arm and that results

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,230
in you know people with personalities
like mine in a little bit smugness

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,379
and if history has taught us anything

20
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:05,929
it's that the best and the brightest

21
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,729
are brought down by hubris cell

22
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,539
win I money a bunch of other stuff

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,220
I have a minor in history and as I got
deeper and deeper into security I kept

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,740
finding these patterns repeating
themselves over and over again

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,810
there can hackers

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,060
since the first on came and picked up a
rock

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,630
I'm nothing that we do is new

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,908
it's just variations on a theme and

29
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,380
you need to know that so that you don't
expect that wud

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,439
I'm see you don't make mistakes because
it it's dangerous not to know

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,299
so when I first are back in stock I was
going to give you

32
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,950
here's a hacker characteristic and here
is and a

33
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,119
on historical example love it here's
another aspect and here's another

34
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:53,890
example

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,740
I thought it would be well kinda dry I'm

36
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,740
so instead I just wanna taste stories if
you want a steady

37
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,459
I'm security computer security arms race

38
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,580
and you want to find patterns anywhere
your best place to look

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,290
is in military history on our arms race

40
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,900
is paralleling on anything it

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,280
that I can find atomically Miley in the
military

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,300
and fun to on ancient Chinese general

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,300
is one love the pic you should read his
art of war

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,230
on the art of war teaches us to rely not
on the likelihood an enemies not coming

45
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,829
but on our own readiness to receive him
not only chance it is not attacking

46
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,349
but rather on the fact that we have made
our position unassailable

47
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,619
show for story

48
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,629
and um hella pics I will give

49
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,518
a chocolate bar this is Lynn financial a
light on the available ones I love your

50
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,830
and you have to import from

51
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,920
Europe on to somebody who can translate

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,569
the Latin for me quick no

53
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,390
nobody without googling alright visit
the very very famous line from Virgil's

54
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:11,950
Aeneid

55
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,349
and it says don't believe the horse

56
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:19,790
%ah on Trojans I fear those Greeks

57
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,500
even those bearing gifts on

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,690
week yeah here I

59
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,209
ask a lot what will share

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm so the interesting thing

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,690
this is my study with I'm

62
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,079
she is thinking about the story is a
Trojan horse

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,470
see is not just that Odysseus had this
idea to build this gigantic or said hi

64
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,620
to 12 soldiers in it

65
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,060
it's a story social engineering through
its social engineering so

66
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,120
virtual writes that that com you know it
all the Greek heroes were there there

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,950
you're all familiar with with the story
the Trojan horse right you know that

68
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,069
that parents can I tell an answer the
Trojan War I took the Greeks for

69
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,709
ever even find Troy I'm and then when
they did

70
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,510
they lay siege around in there were
there for ever and they were beginning

71
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,189
to

72
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:14,829
run out of supplies and they're going to
have to do something and introduces

73
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,310
comes up with this idea to build

74
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,639
I would rather and you got it

75
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,690
found and I'm and high people in it

76
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,719
but what they what they did in this is
the Brit part

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,009
is that the hidden 30 soldiers and their
including a

78
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:34,110
on my decision and I commend on on mics
in some the greatest

79
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,740
reporters at that were but the left one
person

80
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,360
out a soldier earning sign and who
volunteered

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,590
and fine and had the hardest above all
because sign in had to convince the

82
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,690
Trojans

83
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,130
all the Greeks had sailed away so what
he

84
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,780
what he did is he told them that they
had built this enormous horse

85
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,270
as a on as a gift to honor

86
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,109
a on the goddess Athena because they had
destroyed her temple and they wanted to

87
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,289
make recommends

88
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:05,210
and that's what was so and the reason it
was so large was not because for some

89
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,120
and body ain't no never but because they
made it so big that it wouldn't fit

90
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,770
in the walls of Troy on so that the
Trojans wouldn't get any of the benefit

91
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,448
of the blessings of Athena

92
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,720
in other words they manipulated their
emotions on

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,160
we did this you can't do it for their
it's ours you can have it

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,789
for naturally they're gonna want it om
and that's why they brought inside

95
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,870
that way to celebrate on so

96
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,100
social engineering it's been around
forever

97
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,050
I'm

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,210
next story

99
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,489
I'll a little while ago I'm

100
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,509
old 5 6 seven hundred years

101
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,449
I'm there was this this

102
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,330
nation-state that was known for its
naval prowess

103
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,289
and they went to work and his other
nation state that was known for its

104
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,909
on army and its land warfare and

105
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,669
I'm this is by the way the Turk said
against on the Christians in in

106
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:07,810
Constantinople

107
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,990
and the Turk surrounded content a noble
and

108
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,460
on all sides except for the one side
that was that was on the water

109
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,388
was on this little bay and had this
narrow a poor approach to export

110
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,449
and they were able to surround the
everywhere and and Lacey genessee

111
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,860
drawing on for a long time

112
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,210
and both sides are getting kinda
desperate but on

113
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,979
but the Christians and content total
were able to get

114
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,479
on the if they did lockheed the sea
outside that port but the questions were

115
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,130
able to

116
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,750
on to run ships through the blockade it
wasn't really working

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,130
so the on the Turkish general

118
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,849
are getting been able commander on
broader shift up there

119
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,199
and what the on

120
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,130
what the people constantinople had done
was forged these huge chains

121
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,300
and run them under the water so that
what on

122
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,479
so that when the on turks got there they
couldn't get the ships through and these

123
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,219
were I think we're galli rode ships

124
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,560
time om and but the it and it worked

125
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,389
it I'm so essentially what they did is
they laid a firewall across the port

126
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,440
I'm and

127
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,710
I'm and the ship's couldn't get through

128
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,300
and so the battle going on for a while
and it looks like that and once again

129
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,520
the people laying cedras running out of
supplies just like on

130
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,698
like in the Trojan War and

131
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:36,979
you it looks like they people
contactable we're gonna win

132
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,419
but what they had counted on was that
the naval commander the Turkish naval

133
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,150
commander

134
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,509
was a hacker and what to hackers do

135
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,879
the unexpected they violate assumptions

136
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,180
I naval commander want to shift on the
water that's where is the strongest

137
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,400
so the turkish commander beached ships
he pulled out of the water

138
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,639
he forced his sailors and I don't favor
galley slaves are not

139
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,379
on on into the woods where the top
country

140
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,229
and they took us to restrict them a bark
they laid them down using his role as

141
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:09,740
polled

142
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,750
every boat out of the water and what up
and around the chain

143
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,669
in other words history's first
successful firewall bypass

144
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:20,099
I'm and it worked

145
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,180
I'm though the seed went on for a little
while and it wasn't until somebody

146
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,800
accidentally left the gate open

147
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,819
in other words in open court that
contact & Noble fell

148
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,570
om and at this point now I'm actually
gonna shoot

149
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,969
switch over to chairs because we have I
hear with us one is the people who did

150
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,729
the first original work on firewalls

151
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,800
and he's going to talk to us a little
bit about castles and warfare

152
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,709
cast this is gail says

153
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,970
thank you I suppose I should be wired I
can use this

154
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,149
place right here now the world's
quickest changeover

155
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,890
I can use it senior stand-up

156
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,170
fish

157
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,990
I know she is standing ta I can see it
is it there

158
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,890
excellent okay last time boy this is
gonna go quickly against

159
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,350
okay CSO when I'm gonna present to you
in the next fifty year forty three

160
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,110
slides in 12 minutes

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,450
is a shard have been all talk I used to
give security ideas from all over

162
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,540
and since it has historical note:

163
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,640
now we can get game thank you

164
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,699
its is hey year now

165
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,390
I think somebody is a radiating me

166
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,420
I Matt blaze plugged his missed his

167
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,339
stuff into my machine a while ago and I
blame him for this

168
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,920
I think someone's doing it bluetooth is
still on

169
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,160
fascinating while the time to clean
yourself

170
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,790
that's true from you know

171
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,620
it is a Mac it's a computer you already
know how to use its not available I did

172
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,589
turn it off

173
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,649
okay well anyway we'll just proceed as
if this isn't happening

174
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,970
um but it's a great act pretty good
wallet China the idea of the Great Wall

175
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,779
of China

176
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,060
was to keep the barbarians are the north
out of there economy

177
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,130
it was not so much defensive as
economically defense it was formed a

178
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,279
shorter segments

179
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,760
built over a fair amount of time as they
found it work and it wasn't nearly as

180
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,360
imposing in some parts as it was in the
other

181
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,990
because well frankly I'm it takes a lot
of work to build the wall so

182
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,750
we didn't really count it was just a
pile of rubble and it still is

183
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,709
turns I guess con la castle wall
unopposed in into Beijing

184
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:43,149
a.m. so was it really that good now the
wall is just a single layer in courses

185
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,170
on mountaintops

186
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,279
I'll which makes a second layer its

187
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,649
you don't want to run uphill with
someone shooting arrows at you up

188
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,660
the chinese have other similar things
here's our

189
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,779
I believe this is the Summer Palace I'm
maybe the Forbidden City it's been

190
00:10:58,779 --> 00:10:59,980
awhile for me now

191
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,140
and when you go there you pay an entry
fee and you go through several layers

192
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,000
walls

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,459
and they say oh you wanna see the inside
well are you have to pay more money

194
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm but they also include these
firewalls

195
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,950
up these are up raised they have

196
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,740
these all over China raise doorways are
to trip the evil spirit so they can't

197
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,890
get in

198
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,680
this is sort of a firewall for a fairly
modest threat

199
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,269
haha I'm also told it helps keep the
dust out but I've been to China I don't

200
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,720
think it does

201
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,170
on their many doors what the temples
have many opportunities for defense

202
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,899
and %uh stupid defenses keep it usually
keep out only stupid effect attackers

203
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,220
that's not always true ago speaking a
stupid defenses

204
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,260
a there is a course firewall here I am
course referring to the flower pots

205
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,439
here's a close-up view of an
implementation

206
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,639
here is a firewall these accords keep
the big trucks of the

207
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,950
item and it goes on extends around the
thing

208
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,170
fire security doesn't have to be ugly I
talk to the guy who waters the

209
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,469
that dick the sort of sad looking plants
in these things

210
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,019
take some better part of the day to go
all the way around in water a mall

211
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:15,110
and of course here is an actual genuine
firewall

212
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,370
this was photographed before 9/11 but
even so I was

213
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,490
a little nervous and i sat down there
and I

214
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,880
was taking pictures at the Capitol click
and

215
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,820
you know so they wouldn't see me
photographing the guards and the dog and

216
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,459
so on

217
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:32,490
the real firewall is the Delta barrier
there it is it's a little thing that

218
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,500
rises up and down you've seen it in the
movies in Arlington hell it was

219
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,380
installed backwards

220
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,070
on I so you have the diode pointing the
wrong way maybe years

221
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,490
it won't work %uh these things that
there's a panic button in the guards

222
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,220
Shack they can say no and it goes up
very quickly

223
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,570
I'm it is a well-documented fact

224
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,010
that some guard hit the button once to
early as a Japanese ambassador was going

225
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,170
through his limo

226
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,240
and it flipped the limo on its rich no

227
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,250
with the Ambassador inside so anyway
there's another firewall

228
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,470
now parliament has the same thing this
is a little odd

229
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,070
you can see in the foreground there's a
stick this is the Old Mission Impossible

230
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,560
stick I'm gonna crash the car through

231
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,740
I'm across the point is not to damage
your car but to make you show intent if

232
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,690
you break this dick you're a bad guy

233
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,290
you'll also notice that their is a year
Delta barrier there next to the guard

234
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,920
shack

235
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,010
and oddly enough a road going around it

236
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,250
I'm not sure what's going on here out
but if you go a few yards to the left

237
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,000
this is also taken a while ago I suspect
this is Ben

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,930
repaired here is the exit arm

239
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,050
no know nothing I ok with a bad guy
driving the exit I guess it's just not

240
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,820
done

241
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,860
yeah and you can see I was lucky I
happened to catch the Minister for silly

242
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,699
walks

243
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:00,000
sobered perimeter defenses usually have
leaks a built-in

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,160
there's a a poster in GATE is one

245
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,790
up there are other ways Edinburgh Castle
fell

246
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,290
because the guards new way to sneak down
and visit the girlfriend in the city

247
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,240
and the British came back caught the
garden had him come back in

248
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,260
its Trojan horse for just a guy looking
for girl

249
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,360
are most here's a map a big companies
network in a big orange blob

250
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,579
was a leak to the outside world this is
the whole business you could start a

251
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,880
business doing this

252
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,490
on layered defense is should be in depth
we have lots of layers

253
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,910
%ah don't security by obscurity well

254
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,380
when you think about it a cryptographic
key is nothing but a carefully

255
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,510
scientifically chosen hunk obscurity

256
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,720
arm and it shouldn't be your only
defense but it's not a bad start

257
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,540
see racked the slide 22 about 20 now on

258
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,889
belt and suspenders a safer in takes
longer to get through in

259
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,750
the more likely that the attackers will
trigger the alarm if you bother doing

260
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,420
that

261
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,480
here is are if you had me to no end
clearance you can spend a week at Sandia

262
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,800
National Laboratories

263
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,269
and I'll teach you all about the design
and affects our

264
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,310
at nuclear weapons arm

265
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,329
this is one of the slides for Mac or
Steve 11

266
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,779
put in the foyer request about half the
slides came back blank

267
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,850
on but this one was quite interesting
this was

268
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,019
the layers of stuff they use to prevent
unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon and

269
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,269
as you might assume

270
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:28,779
lots and lots of different layers in
lotsa lotsa different types personnel

271
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,189
procedures security

272
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,600
stinking badges you know that sorta
stuff I'm

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,320
recapture in recovery is one of them you
know these things are designed to be in

274
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,709
bad guys hands for omit certain amount
of time like a safe

275
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,660
before you can do something bad to the
weapon and to yourself

276
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,019
I'm that time is class fight so let's
look at something a little older

277
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,230
if you're ever in odd in

278
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,389
in Germany I suggest you visit a few
castles I in Heidelberg there's a castle

279
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,509
there in here is

280
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:00,579
if you want to attack at this is one of
the ways you can attack

281
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,660
you can run along the side in this hell
and you'll see

282
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,160
there's little arrow placed give you an
opportunity to die for your country

283
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,449
or your cause actually ever germany was
such a bunch of different

284
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:14,600
pieces it's hard to tell you you're
dying for well now you knew who you were

285
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,589
dying for

286
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:19,550
the guy gets confusing and pleasure in
history major so chance to do that

287
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,120
and see run pass these things and you
come up to

288
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,839
a gate which of course was all locked so
he had to get your way through here

289
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,480
well people shot at you and when she got
in you got into this courtyard

290
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,839
where you were met with more gates and
more little places

291
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,139
for arrows to shoot you and then you
come down this hallway

292
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,730
on the lower left and there are little
holes where you get more type people are

293
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,370
throwing

294
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,050
epithets and things down on you I'm

295
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,259
and of course then you you went through
that and yes there's another doorway

296
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,880
with people shooting down at you that's
hard to get back then you go inside this

297
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,810
sort of wine cask area would like some
holes to get shot at

298
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,850
and up at the boiling oil

299
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,549
oh yeah all that sort of stuff and more
epithets in your general direction

300
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:09,879
and I hear are you come up to the
cashiers

301
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,520
gate which of course was in a cashier's
cage am

302
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,459
and you have to fight your way through
there this is I've lost track of the

303
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,650
number layers

304
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,780
and a course once you get through that
you break and then you get to the cement

305
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,020
mixer

306
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,400
I yeah edge if there was a little
confusing to you here is in

307
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,480
diagram at the castle %uh the castle had
an

308
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,500
but may still be the world's largest
wine storage

309
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,919
container you paid your taxes in wine a
checked it before you got to pour it in

310
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:39,419
there

311
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,610
and I was actually a pipe to the main
Hall

312
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,890
so they had plenty of wine I failure
modes of Heidelberg Castle

313
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,120
well are captured by the way when you go
on

314
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,770
when you go to Europe in the visit
castles and they give you tour the

315
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,510
castle's

316
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,059
ask him how their castles died how they
were taken um because usually very proud

317
00:17:59,059 --> 00:17:59,668
of them

318
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,590
and they don't want to tell you the the
transkei managers overran it in a few

319
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,389
hours

320
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,730
yeah on the other hand for something
like Heidelberg it's pretty obvious that

321
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,970
it happen and I'll show you in a moment

322
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,490
to be captured after two month siege and
I see I have a retard department of

323
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,890
redundancy department here

324
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,330
not captured and in 1689 was captured by
thirty thousand french

325
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,850
soldiers in well French none of their
soldiers in a few hours

326
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,169
there were something like two hundred
ninety defenders there an ETA defenders

327
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,039
you have to hire

328
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,650
enough defenders I'm and of course

329
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,020
I'll once you've taken over a castle I
mean it'll piss you off to spend hours

330
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,179
getting into a castle

331
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,450
lots of your friends are dead and so on
%uh you go to where they store the

332
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,179
Dina the gunpowder and you blow this
thing up

333
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,169
this must have been awesome look out
sick those walls were that was because

334
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,799
it's for gunpowder on this must have
been

335
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,440
okay guys get really far away and watch
this is gonna be fun

336
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,940
I I don't know if I'd want to light the
fuse screw

337
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,020
but this happen in due course what you
see when you're on the outside

338
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,340
is the castle that that half a tower is
called the clock tower

339
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,220
you can tell the French were pretty
pissed at that too on

340
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,400
so I'm actually finishing up here a
little ahead of time

341
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,610
I and I'll give you a modern-day are
some

342
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,049
example the you may have thought about
incorrectly or so on

343
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:29,870
weirder programs run show of hands and i
cant see a single 1 I've you

344
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,520
but you can see yourselves how many have
you seen this diagram at least once

345
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,120
that I'm of what they had seen all the
books it's been there for forty years or

346
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,299
something like that

347
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:43,740
it the fact of the matter is this model
is wrong

348
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,490
the actual answer is this it's the
kernel that talks to the outside world

349
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,850
not the program and if you want route

350
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,309
route may let you in thread but you see
even there the layers are not so clear

351
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:02,340
and that is my cock thank you

352
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,699
%ah upset you

353
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,650
let me introduce not going to talk about
something else because there's a other

354
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,230
kinds arms recess

355
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,500
not just military and national security
and a really fun one of course is in the

356
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:15,890
lock

357
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,740
community so there's a lot of really hit
interesting stuff for their unlock

358
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,990
hackers

359
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,000
be well before tool was created to

360
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,179
an asp.net to to talk to us about the
history of locks

361
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:32,809
this march of

362
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,190
have another one some to get surprised
that they can identify the musically

363
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,210
ok ask it so I'm

364
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,620
I'm a move to a modern up modern history

365
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,740
I am here

366
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,610
in america his Creator

367
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,770
aka okay

368
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,820
so I'm gonna talk about come modern
history

369
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,309
that is you know through like the 19th
century

370
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:04,450
on any particular arm some

371
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,230
some familiar arm circumstances

372
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,830
that look an awful lot like what goes on
today except no one was using

373
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,149
electricity for any effect

374
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,850
um so in particular I want to talk about
what happened

375
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,240
to security when arm mass production

376
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,929
and people the scientific method

377
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,870
started to take hold are and created

378
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,049
you know the Industrial Revolution and
in particular

379
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,289
this is this kind period from about 1794

380
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:42,230
to about 1851 that is the first place

381
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,190
I'm going when I I get my time machine

382
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,870
and up to the first person I wanna go
back and talk to

383
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,700
is a fellow by the name a bug Joseph
drama Obama was

384
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,309
a a British you know inventor are kinda
benjamin Franklin

385
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:02,080
britain if you're a British school child
this is the guy

386
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,168
learn about that you're supposed to be
like

387
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,309
I'm you some he invented the flush
toilet

388
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,490
the the design the current event if
you've ever been to England in a hotel

389
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,230
you know how you can't flush the toilet

390
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,890
that was burgled have promised to sign
and he

391
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,330
invented the modern um your pump

392
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,740
other one that the poll beer from a calf
backs Joseph brown he invented a whole

393
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,350
bunch of other mostly kinda hydrodynamic

394
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,760
related things feeling yup between the
beer pump n the

395
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,260
flush toilet kinda both ends of the
spectrum

396
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,760
on and I'm that made his fortune for Mac

397
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,070
and build an increasingly large arm
manufacturing shop

398
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,780
outside of London arm patented some of
his art designs and licensed from

399
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,299
out again these guys on a lot of these
designs remain in use

400
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:55,360
occur this pay for various for for
various things

401
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,210
and arm then decide what awake next

402
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,340
and he um there some varying stories
about how this

403
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm how this came about in one of the
stories I he was bringing arrived

404
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,730
but he decided to welcome cake is
machining and call his attention to lock

405
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,669
box

406
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:19,159
and in particular he wanted true apply
the modern idea

407
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,309
love interchangeable standard

408
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,789
harkes to locks

409
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,400
and this was a completely radical a
crazy idea

410
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,559
Ahmed at the time because the idea I'm

411
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,139
love how blacks get killed is you get a

412
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,980
locksmith a member of the guild very
heavily trusted gilda locksmiths

413
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,279
I could design a lock for your door

414
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,880
and the locksmith somebody with a lot to
lose and so you can be

415
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,000
you can be sure that he is not going to
tell anybody have a lock on your door

416
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,429
and works

417
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:58,950
and he's not going to reuse the design
anywhere else so that your key

418
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,270
will fit into some other customer of his
walk

419
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,190
and in order to become a locksmith with
a very very big deal

420
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,510
only the very very wealthy had locks on
their door

421
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,840
saddam and they had two if you lost your
key

422
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,899
you were really screwed because it would
take you about a year to get a

423
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,270
replacement

424
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,370
a new lock designed and custom made for

425
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,820
for you on and Joseph Brahma

426
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,629
on decided to bring to England this idea
that maybe you can have a standard lock

427
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,380
design

428
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,950
and um interchangeable parts and just
tell everybody the same block from the

429
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,480
same

430
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,730
machining you also built his own
machining and its own tooling

431
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,429
and so on and I'm p.m.

432
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:44,679
he is so famous for this that when in
the

433
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,679
leaked um 19th century when he moved his
store for him

434
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,990
24 piccadilly I'm to up

435
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,990
near Baker Street he ended up becoming
arm

436
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:59,110
essentially a full-time lock
manufacturing company on his descendants

437
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,450
still

438
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,470
run it to this day he moved from
Piccadilly Inn in

439
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,309
in very central London to near Baker
Street in slightly less

440

London Science Museum

442
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,970
and school children can go in and see it
and you can look at

443
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,750
three %um the Original Score front this

444
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,340

visited the shop and spoke with

446
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,140
um jeffrey Brown a who is his great

449
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,630

450
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,169
I'm a big fan you'll get them but war

451
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:51,900
and I'm I got a couple days relax from
there

452
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,140
that's a design out a little bit unusual
to kind of traditional American

453
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,320
a lock designs the tumblers are

454
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,980
in a circular a pattern so it's more
like animals tubular lock keys for a

455
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,700
bicycle

456
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,350
and it doesn't use pins accuses these
things called sliders

457
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,730
arm the to standard-sized so under

458
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,370
arm the key I is this tubular

459
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,429
arcade love a key it all quite beautiful

460
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,059
and to this day if you go through the
expensive neighborhoods London

461
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,090
and you look at the couple blocks that
are on the doors

462
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,620
you will encounter arm various
generations of

463
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,159
a prom locks arm in front of some other
more expensive

464
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,830
homes and businesses there because the
design is regarded as being pretty good

465
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,470
if you do this too much the cops are
going to come I'm a bike

466
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,029
um you know until they come you will
find you can spot the prom a lot before

467
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,039
the cops pick you up at a game

468
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,100
on minor things that they have a I i
noticed in his

469
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,539
reconstruction shop they had a pick up a

470
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,760
the contract a called an indenture

471
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,320
this is how you learned to a trade in
those days between him

472
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,570
and got his assistants from 1794

473
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,928
it contains in parking taxes are so you
can embezzle

474
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,980
peruca you're going to waste any abuse
the goods are property of the NASCAR

475
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,820
girl in the same without his consent any
person or persons who ever

476
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,860
more seldom buyer traffic with his own
goods

477
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,419
nor those are any other person or
persons during the said time

478
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:28,370
so you can set up your own side business
nor play at dice cards are any

479
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,880
and more other unlawful or emailing
games or sports

480
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,690
North 3-pointer go to any playhouses our
house is a bill fame

481
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,190
nor any caverns are Ale House is except
about his cell

482
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,510
said masters business if I and there to
be done in only to stay so long as hell

483
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,440
absolutely be necessary for transacting
it said masters business central not

484
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,880
commit fornication

485
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,230
nor contract matrimony nor two-parter
absence of

486
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,000
so you know if it you have to really be
committed if you wanted to

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,409
out your name um in this business but
one other things

488
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,679
I so on

489
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,710
the this is a picture of a modern key
and

490
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,620
essentially promise lock apply this
principle there's nothing secret about

491
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,980
the key

492
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,010
except the way it's cut arm

493
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,690
so there's a standard key design all the
customers of this lock everybody who

494
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,039
buys the lock

495
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:29,010
gets the same key and that he is then
customized

496
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,230
could be II configured

497
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,690
with the security parameter for a
particular instance

498
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,840
a full lock that you buy and that allows
you to describe

499
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,880
the security parameter of a key by
basically describing

500
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,340
how we'd spend parameterized for that
axle

501
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,289
century we could go to relax with today
and say give me a slavish

502
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:56,570
on SE 20 keep aidid for code 314 159

503
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,840
and what you'll get will look exactly
like this

504
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,320
and that's why we have this concise
description a Vicky and we don't have to

505
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,080
say okay I'm gonna send off to the
factory and they're gonna catch

506
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,070
this thing and we'll we'll get it in a
couple weeks they can just take the play

507
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,168
a key blank that they buy in bulk

508
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:16,970
and cut configurator to fix your
particular like

509
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,520
so essentially we have the first system
ob-gyn

510
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,889
mechanical are in the mic tirely in the
mechanical

511
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,130
world in which the security is based
entirely by on the password

512
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,010
rather than on the password checking
mechanism everybody gets the same basic

513
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,309
block design

514
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:37,299
everybody gets the same basic keys but
having the key to my apartment doesn't

515
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:38,100
help me open

516
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,149
your apartment arm or poor house for

517
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:45,710
or castle or business or what have you
because the secret is that

518
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,770
easily changed little parameterized
thing

519
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,590
now what is back what effect does that
have it makes these things go from being

520
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,289
very expensive custom

521
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:57,830
are machines to really cheap things that
you can

522
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,220
if its compromise change out quickly

523
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,940
so on promise designed by the way
survives to this day

524
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,760
an outsider promises lock you can tell
me what the bottom

525
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,860
picture is here that's promise key

526
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,620
what's the cop tubular like a bicycle
lock key

527
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,590
same basic idea I'm if you look head-on
you'll see that there are these cocks

528
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,330
um unit this is kinda looking head on
down the barrel if you take a look down

529
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,870
at the

530
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,640
he itself you'll see that there are
these little ridges don't know if I can

531
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,929
well I can't really point I'm but you'll
see if you look at the bottom there

532
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:34,570
these ridges thereof varying

533
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,039
depts that's the security parameter for
these things

534
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,490
promise keylex kinda cleaner and older
but

535
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,700
um same basic idea I'm his keys come
with a little cap

536
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,460
I'm in other dickens The Pickwick Papers
there's a reference to a

537
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,970
rich person who has a promise key
distinguished by the little cap at the

538
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,840
end to keep dust

539
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,220
out the cap at the end is now made of
plastic instead of leather

540
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,529
but he still provide I'm the locks are

541
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,070
interchangeable parts and painter
operate not from the very beginning I

542
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,629
love them

543
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,850
harm from the very beginning of history
but they will enter operate

544
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,240
wave on locks the callback I'm

545
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,519
army order a hundred years does the
brother cap actually

546
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,120
on act as a and other security features
it would prevent you from photograph

547
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,649
Traci

548
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,789
it prevents you from sold shoulder
surfing the key

549
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:31,010
on by the way this the same mechanism
you use come

550
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,779
you've ever spent time in a prison arm
as a visitor

551
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:37,799
I'm cards of an have a

552
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,590
cover over their keys these these large
queues for open cells

553
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,600
arm one of the models love lock me by
%um

554
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,970
I'm Adams right arm uses um

555
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,370
are has a snap-on cover that can

556
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,779
a.m. conceal the keying pattern

557
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,950
on block because the people in jail have
nothing to do but watch the guards all

558
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,539
back

559
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:04,260
arm and learn what their keys look like
so this also provides a bit of a

560
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,470
security mechanism

561
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,860
but I think Brahma does it mostly
because there's this reference to it in

562
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,140
our in Pickens and you know why use that
bike

563
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,370
not having this anymore all
interchangeable parts if

564
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:21,390
something goes wrong with part of it arm
the you can nom

565
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,149
you can I just fix that one piece in
particular if you wanna re keyed

566
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:31,370
this Center cylinder contains the
sliders that are the parameterized

567
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,769
Skype on mechanism for the security
other

568
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:38,799
so the big question that Brahma had to
answer

569
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,860
when he it go said this radical idea
everyone is going to get the same

570
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,679
block and it's going to be more secure
than be four

571
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,549
on what do you think brahmin needed to
overcome and by the way my locks a

572
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:53,908
little bit cheaper than that expensive
one

573
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:59,169
on the web and what do you think people
might have worried about

574
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:03,080
is this guy is crazy or this guy trying
to rip me off

575
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,090
on because how could this possibly be
secure

576
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,659
this is a radically new idea why you
know why

577
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:14,789
standardized parts for for locking you
didn't invent the idea standardize part

578
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:16,730
but you really did bring it to britain

579
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,909
at the time and um it was

580
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:24,610
it was an unusual one how is this going
to be secure

581
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,870
soul im he did a very clever thank

582
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,330
he started the first as far as I can
tell the first documented security

583
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,659
challenge

584
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,200
and I'm he put in befriend 1794 he put
this

585
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,399
placard in huge front love you shop

586
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:45,399
and it says read it's a little hard to
read on the screen I presume I can see

587
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,929
this hard for me to read on the screen

588
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:51,789
i cant use going at all but um it says
the artist who can make an instrument

589
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:56,129
that will pick or open this lock shall
receive two hundred guineas the moment

590
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,250
it is produced

591
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,340
applications in writing arm promised
pack

592
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,700
blocks caution arm you we reap

593
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,909
it is respectfully on in fee and

594
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:12,210
every lock meet in Brahma are is stamped
with their address

595
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,770
124 piccadilly except no substitutes

596
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,339
essentially two hundred guineas if you
open this lock

597
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:24,219
not open this lack and I will have the
caps lock your ass off

598
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,550
and you will never be heard from again
that's how we will secure no

599
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,909
open this law can I want my word you
greatly but don't open it and I'm going

600
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:35,050
to continue to crow that nobody has gone
act

601
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,200
and on how long do you think that lasted

602
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,389
collecting Jourdain early

603
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:45,579
so 1794 to 1851

604
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:49,829
arm this lock was unopened in Brahma
shop

605
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:53,619
then the great exhibition happened arm

606
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,020
and %uh the Great Exhibition acerbic
nights fair yep

607
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,280
are the Great Exhibition sorting unites
fairer of

608
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,680
arm invention and a modern enrolled in

609
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,790
are in just outside of London and up

610
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:10,670
a fellow the other person why wanna meet
with my Time Machine

611
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,280
I may have to make two trips to go and
meet them up both

612
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,430
are the same time I'm I was appalled by
the name

613
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:24,460
Alfred Seahawks I he is my hero he
deserves to be your hero to

614
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,710
our music was an American lock actor
just extraordinaire he heard about the

615
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,869
Brahma like

616
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:33,990
saved his money for passage to britain
and said you know what

617
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,980
I'm gonna get back two hundred guineas
250 by the way with a lot of money

618
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,450
I'm even with the inflation that
occurred between 1794

619
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,560
in 1852 this was enough to not only on
make your reputation

620
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,150
if you were defeated promise lock but
you would make a fortune

621
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,730
by defeating well

622
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,900
the from in any case

623
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,550
the arm the

624
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:06,079
Hobbs and what had never seen the slot
before he had heard about it

625
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,770
and we're sure that he could defeat so
we went over to the Brahma

626
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,589
booth essentially at the Great
Exhibition Centre we see that bank

627
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,460
and spent a couple of days with it and
opened

628
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,079
and instead I'll suing the guy's ass

629
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,010
commenting 8 you didn't read the fine
print it said not valid at Great

630
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,970
Exhibition

631
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,570
on the I'm after some haggling it to you
they didn't

632
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,859
actually pay up immediately it took a
little while

633
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:38,700
but he got the money and Brahma slightly
improved his lock design as a result

634
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,070
made made some mac basic strangers to
the design for

635
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,140
did make some small Kings the design try
to

636
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,848
I'm defeat some %uh via

637
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:53,040
methods that you used and essentially
Brahma stayed in business he ended up

638
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,970
looking good because he did the
honorable thing

639
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:01,000
on you can try to weasel out of it hubs
then proceeded to go and open the try

640
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,710
block

641
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,170
which was the main competitor to the up
from a lock and then the gale lock

642
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,730
com which is the main lock design used
in the United States and showed how to

643
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,680
defeat those

644
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,069
and any open diffuse aches and um

645
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,210
what did he then drew well he could have
done two things he could have kept

646
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,270
asking himself

647
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,970
and become the world's greatest beef
because he really

648
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,390
was you know equipped to be the world's
greatest beef

649
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,339
but he did the honorable thing to he
told everybody else

650
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:33,529
he destroyed the value of the secrets
that he knew about how to open these

651
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,329
locks

652
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:37,980
by writing a book describing it and um

653
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,130
you see this book still kinda goes in
and out of print scored on the

654
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,680
construction of locks and safes but it's
really under

655
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,649
speeding up locks and safes on by Alfred
hobson's first published in 1853

656
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,050
on and I'm just gonna review from the
preface to this it's in small print

657
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:53,630
sumner

658
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,700
discovery it he started out with an
interesting

659
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,420
comment he said in a commercial and in
some respects social doubt

660
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,560
has been started within the last year or
two

661
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,640
whether or not it is right to discuss so
openly the security or insecurity of

662
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,650
locks

663
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,910
many well-meaning person suppose that
the discussion respecting the means for

664
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,549
battling the supposed safety have locks

665
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,609
offers a premium for dishonesty by
showing

666
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:23,109
others how to be dishonest this is a
fallacy

667
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:26,720
roads are very keen in their profession
and already know much more than we can

668
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,570
teach them

669
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,540
respecting their several kinds of
bravery raise hats new a good deal more

670
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,230
about lockpicking long before locksmith
discussed among themselves

671
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,070
as they've lately done if a locked let
it have been made whatever country or

672
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,500
what

673
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,930
by whatever maker it's not so invaluable
as good as hitherto been deemed to be

674
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,960
surely it is in the interest of honest
persons

675
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,050
know this fact because the dishonest are
kinda ugly certain to apply the

676
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,430
knowledge practically

677
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,810
and by the spread of a knowledge it is
necessary to be fair play to those who

678
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,890
might otherwise suffer by

679
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,328
ignorance you cannot be to earnestly
urged that it

680
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:04,650
an acquaintance with real facts will in
the end be better for all parties

681
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,420
now if it weren't for the fact that to

682
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,310
for this is what's hot I just want to
point out that if you weren't for the

683
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,680
fact that this is well written

684
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,299
this could be easily have been Britain
today from

685
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,599
the I am nothing changes and I'll let me
just leave you

686
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,020
with a hundred years later um a

687
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,540
length and can 10 make the standard and

688
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,820
nevermind lengthened wrote the standard
book

689
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,170
unsafe cracking been 1953 exactly 100
years

690
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:41,250
after um after Hobbs

691
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,730
arm add who broke the

692
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,790
prom a lock and they included a preface

693
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,400
in their book to and it says

694
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,310
that it is extremely important that the
information contained in this book

695
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,400
be faithfully guarded so as not to fall
into the hands of undesired I

696
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,619
we suggest after you become proficient
in the art of manipulation first

697
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:04,050
Facebook completely

698
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,619
so as to protect yourself in a crap
unfortunately not everyone followed that

699
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,130
advice cuz I got my copy from the
library

700
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:17,130
thanks are

701
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,240
so music

702
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,609
you know it okay I'm

703
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:30,810
I if for the day came later on I was
playing music I can't seem to get to

704
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,680
play right now

705
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,759
up

706
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,359
yep so this I'm but the electorate is
there a day

707
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,869
is I'm marvelous piece a polyphonic
checked

708
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:46,440
I'm and it has some interesting
characteristics

709
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,569
I'm the first one is that

710
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:54,210
it is written for in a on challenge
response

711
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,300
mode and the on trouble follow which
hits

712
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,780
is is one of the earliest pieces in
history to hit the high C om

713
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,510
changes every it every repetition every
iteration

714
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,880
I'm another interesting part part about
it

715
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,089
is that it um

716
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:18,400
well it was one of the first piece in
history

717
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,319
to be. um controlled by a the analog
version of DRM

718
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:30,200
you see overrode it um late 16th century

719
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,099
and he wrote for the pope and the pope
loved

720
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,190
it had its 350 real beauty it's just
this the score disputed music

721
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,069
I'm and therefore he wanted to keep it
all to himself

722
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:46,990
so he issued a papal ban on copies at
this piece of music

723
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,140
appearing anywhere and he actually
allowed to

724
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,810
very expensive licenses there to
princess who are allowed to license copy

725
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,599
so that

726
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,500
for one performance only I'm but sound
familiar

727
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,690
but otherwise on

728
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,940
know the they on they were given back to
the hand %uh on

729
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,040
on Vatican chapel on people and returned
back to the Vatican

730
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,359
chapel library the other thing about
them is that a

731
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,210
is that it's only allowed to be played
during Easter week

732
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,010
so if you if you weren't anywhere near
the vatican you never got a chance to

733
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:20,680
hear this

734
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,950
in really spooky PC music that is until
a 14-year-old hacker

735
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,339
got a chance to to hear it Mozart

736
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,000
on tour vitaly happen to be visiting
during Easter week

737
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,839
and he went to a Tuesday Vespers

738
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:43,839
listen to it and cannot wrote it down

739
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,380
he went back the next day and on picked
up the few pieces that had missed

740
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,470
and om another two history says that
there too

741
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,700
on series of what happened one is that

742
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,750
the pope was so impressed by Mozart's
magical musical ability

743
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:05,180
back on he forgave him in and everything
was okay

744
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,980
but really not that sold it to a music
publisher

745
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,260
I'm the ring to work in it didn't work
then it doesn't work out

746
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,700
I'm the interesting thing about this
piece in music

747
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,460
is that on or about Mozart writing it
down is that it's a very simple

748
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,569
algorithm

749
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:25,680
any any lead hacker was sufficient
skills could write this piece town

750
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,490
its its chant which means that that most
if it is the same

751
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:34,540
and then there's some slight variation
in a diverse for the algorithm used

752
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,290
to to get this peace music is the same
one that you use to backup your system

753
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,740
if you do incremental backups one pass
to get them most of it

754
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,780
and other passes to get the things that
have changed

755
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,500
palm

756
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,849
Sep at the beginning I talk

757
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:57,010
I said that there were two reasons but I
wanted to give the talk

758
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,020
I'm seeing certain threads a pattern
that by themselves

759
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,310
are neither good nor bad they just
simply are but when you tie them

760
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,190
together

761
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,900
it's a bit scary from a securities
perspective if you look at security from

762
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,720
and mental level and not from at not at
which individual Park

763
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,589
and the the three threads are these
first

764
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,119
in my talk today I've used three
different computers

765
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:25,619
mom this one was acting as a timepiece

766
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,640
this one is my protection device and
this one was my media player

767
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,299
I could use just one but I happen to
like stuff especially if it's shiny and

768
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,450
has wifi

769
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:38,160
and and all of these

770
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,359
machines our full fledge computers

771
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,549
all of them interact with each other all
them interact with everybody else's

772
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,859
weather here on the far side the world

773
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:53,130
all love them have multiple attacks
surfaces

774
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,560
and all of them can be configured to be
attacked actors

775
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,630
that pattern one

776
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,569
thread to computer science as a field

777
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:09,710
as a science is maturing and like all
fields as they mature it's beginning to

778
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,730
fracture into its specialties

779
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,960
so now edit and a normal undergraduate
program

780
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,510
it is very difficult to get a complete
in-depth

781
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,710
education all parts of computer science
and graduate in four years

782
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,869
you can't do it you have to specialize
in something

783
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:29,700
on what this means for security is
really back

784
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,240
om we can't afford a specialized because

785
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,770
well attackers can defenders kept om

786
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,009
you have to defend against everything so

787
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:43,190
in the academic world what I'm seeing is
stacked

788
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,270
the programming languages people are
getting

789
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:50,079
grant money to develop secure
programming languages because that is

790
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,109
going to solve all the security problems

791
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:55,950
the on database people the same thing
the architecture people the same thing

792
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,810
the theory people

793
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,940
we just got this this this perfect
serious security and that will fall over

794
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,180
problems

795
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,319
that systems percent I see

796
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:09,710
everything as how it interacts with
everything else as part of a system

797
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,109
and this

798
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:16,270
this scares me I'm because

799
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,420
that programming landed program that is
written in a programming language that

800
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,440
is compiled with the compiler that is

801
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,890
running on an OS that is using an
architecture that has a firmware and

802
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,730
that has hardware on it and every single
part effect

803
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:32,540
if %uh is is potentially vulnerable on
and all I have to do is a simple write

804
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,599
amplification

805
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,780
to get for but maybe not so simple but
pic

806
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,960
you understand i idea and the third
reason

807
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,329
that out on the third thread is the real
reason I wanted to give the stock

808
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:49,440
last year desk on in one of those really
rare moment of quiet

809
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,800
we're all sitting in his hotel room the
handful of and

810
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,770
drag on suddenly burst out laughing and
we thought that he found another one of

811
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,700
his seriously demented videos and we all
wanted to see it

812
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,579
I'm because they're funny but their
twisted am

813
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:07,280
and no he looked up and he said hello
1990s

814
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,670
PCP injection is back

815
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,079
and I haven't been able to stop thinking
about that all year it's back

816
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,270
it shouldn't be we solve this problem
they've any view got

817
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:21,380
the privilege of hearing on Renderman
and Dragons talk on Friday

818
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,480
it on the back its back with a vengeance
it's worse than it was

819
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,940
we are far more vulnerable because in
the unexpected interactions

820
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,569
apart subsystems and that system could
be at

821
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:34,970
a single device or more troubled devices
interconnecting from

822
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,510
who knows where arm

823
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,619
if history teachers anything it's that

824
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:45,720
if you don't know your history you're
condemned

825
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,510
to make those mistakes yourself and we
can't afford that

826
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,670
because the don't think about on think

827
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,109
this is another quote from fun so om

828
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:01,380
i know i guess i I didn't put that one
on but

829
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,660
I'm you can't fight

830
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,980
you can't win a war where your purely on
the defensive

831
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,190
all you can do is maintain the status
quo and that's the best we can do right

832
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,790
now

833
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,819
there are we have two models for
defending ourself

834
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:19,460
you either have the Center for Disease
Control model where you are

835
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,530
inoculate yourself against every known
on

836
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,400
virus every known vulnerability and you
stick yourself out there any way to get

837
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,880
attacked and then when you are you clean
yourself often you do it again

838
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,609
om and the second model is the castle
and not model

839
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,098
you build these layers have defense's

840
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:39,309
you strictly control ingress and egress

841
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:42,720
and you sick yourself out there and you
a ticket to get attacked on

842
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,520
and that's all we have and that's the
best we can do and I'm almost at a time

843
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,309
but

844
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:53,599
the status quo for now it it if you do
it right

845
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,869
it's working fake but you need to know

846
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:00,670
you cannot make these functions that
because I have I'm specialists in this

847
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,380
field

848
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,280
on that that's where all my tax are
going to come from and that's the hubris

849
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,700
that that we need to be aware of week we
need to pay attention to everything

850
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,339
so you need to learn your history and
we're at a time thank you for the think

851
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:19,540
come it's a topic because I gotta

852
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,020
we have plenty left for this fantastic
to Josh for identifying them as a day
