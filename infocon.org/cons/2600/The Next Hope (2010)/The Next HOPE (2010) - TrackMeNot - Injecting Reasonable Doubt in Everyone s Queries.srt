1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,670
sign in 2006 I'm just after AOL
discloses our truck of many of the its

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,298
users

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,590
and a.m. well sis

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,440
reveals that our search logs reveal
contain more information than

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,520
we actually believe and also chose thats

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,060
even and in my sir trucks are not sat on
any mice you can you

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,560
learning a lot about someone again even
II recovers I don't see if someone just

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,130
based on its search logs

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,580
and it's even worse

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,860
through today I mean I'm when you

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,890
read Google privacy polices and hoes at
any my search logs

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,579
after it night nine months to 18 months
you don't really know

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,930
what kind of information that can
retrieve just based on your search

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,629
trucks and after as error even

15
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,829
some piece of aggregated love said say
could even sure

16
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,180
according to their privacy policy so
they I rec'd

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,210
that's fine aggregated information Rs
information that does not identify you

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,799
I aren't just nuts her reflects

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,760
it in an interview you'll a in a jiffy
ability did you go

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,890
and utility percent am

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,930
so is your ID was checking out west

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,340
to provide a simple solution I know we
can you store to just makes our training

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,619
muslims web on Google

24
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:25,360
on any such a design but the thing is we
store I'm

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,390
no one well not everyone can you start a

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,490
its some others can and

27
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,798
no it's a great tool but some not
everyone is able

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,970
a 22 you store to search appropriately

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,250
also even is if stories well configured

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,470
you have to use its and correct way I'm

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,689
for instance or recently and Jerrys is
some

32
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,350
a lever lever search lab in France we've
made an experiment anti-regulatory Xbox

33
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,850
and if forty-six percent over for 25 26

34
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,619
person to person are running a

35
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,439
its roots are exit nodes where looked
into rules when timid searching google

36
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,979
so I'm it reveals that even if you're
considered

37
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,870
to are correctly it's not sure that's
your lot really be anonymous you have to

38
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,260
well most of the user may not really
a.m. configure its

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,690
appropriately and also

40
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,760
I said US to send a signal to search in
Giants I because when you're on the most

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,730
so

42
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,079
you cannot be don't actually Google us
know I do thats many

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,250
users a.m. back to each do not take the
privacy policy and try to

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,590
goes from tore when you're when you're
using Tory cannot be counted and

45
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,379
a.m. that US to send a signal a so it
can be

46
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,030
seen by searching Giants and am

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,269
so there is no such scenes and it was
unknown up doubt for

48
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,940
a will search and

49
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,239
base away a.m. when you up to it from

50
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,940
something like advertise advertised ac
2-tier you just about from are

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,359
advertising have you're not up to up to
now from tracking

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,099
so Eric so said US two

53
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,879
a use web certification will just
creating those

54
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,690
a in your search history so that's a
certain time will not be able

55
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,000
to really interpret your search and
we'll have to

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,269
so well try to feature some

57
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,420
track me that carries two really fine
what's you know you're interested in

58
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,099
and so is your ideas that's

59
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:34,950
no one should be sure that's paper in
your search history has been generated

60
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,489
by you

61
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,790
so let's take an example am these are
your research and writing

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,250
you're someone which I have access to
why find the fruits of your neighbors

63
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,470
and you once

64
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,750
NEC also queries eg is that goes through
so WiFi networks and

65
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,000
when you see a primary DNS %um said the
user issues occurrence that reveal

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,010
something about him

67
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,629
I'm well ideally we struck me not
normally from that be able to do sex

68
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,040
scene

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,370
Owens it when you see a curry can no
longer assume assume

70
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,650
said he does you made better user you
have to also a and it's a possibility

71
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,150
that may be tracking urging her to query
and that the user itself in self

72
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,180
so whether you're a certain time are
just someone

73
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,350
where type away or typing on wifi
networks or BOS

74
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,540
I'm normally issued not be able to am

75
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,810
be sure is that someone made a curry and
be sure that someone is interested in

76
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,360
something

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,750
so that's why would like to call a
reasonable doubt to elect

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,949
at tryouts a property where for any crew
in your search

79
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,389
history research on that certain
financial and not be able to

80
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:43,710
be sure that you might occur every
issues should be unknown

81
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,638
a negligible probably it is attracting I
should the ferry

82
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,050
so normally if I know someone is using
attract me nots

83
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,520
am I should not be able to really be
sure that's

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,740
as agrees is made by by him butts

85
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,220
the series well if I don't know was
using track me nuts am

86
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,940
ok and I Jen and no was using its

87
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,729
n wait which which part of the crew is
at Rs should be receiving my looks

88
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,110
I actually made by basic by users

89
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,430
so sets a point that normally if
tracking that's not detectable

90
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,539
you have to assume that everyone is
using its alt

91
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,460
lettuce a.m. and in a.m.

92
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,599
identifying per proportion of people are
using its you can not snows pretty lazy

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,259
for user to use it

94
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:34,880
and if you receive saccharine you search
logs you have to believe that's

95
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,590
pro maybe the user is using track me
nuts and if is using tracking that maybe

96
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,650
this curry has been generated by
tracking at

97
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,639
I make here at this point

98
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,789
so as a physician affect me nuts as been
foolish in 2006 and it was really

99
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,190
just like prefer front steps am to prove
that this approach may work Sat

100
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,229
anonymity was not to salt solution to I
have some privacy when we're doing

101
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:01,900
search

102
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,560
on internets so I'm a to provide some
technical details

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,729
for you out troops submitted ways XML
HTTP request

104
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,740
am I we use to fix stuff

105
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,490
a set of the worst to generate queries
so we use a dictionary

106
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,580
a I think about 1500 words and so set on
Jan

107
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,609
could usually features a query that were
not made by track me nuts

108
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,080
and detect them also Perry you are made
out to fix kid you'll

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm so it was not too hard for such and
I'm to identify

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,090
user perry made by tracking admit at
this time it was just like a perfect

111
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,699
concepts

112
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:45,740
to prove that's as a separation mate
Matt

113
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,240
might might work

114
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,000
Paris so as a separate as it well
tracking data is the first there has

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,349
been

116
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,539
widely criticized a for is a reason that

117
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,979
II div early and as so

118
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,080
from his critics for try to improve
tracking automated more robust San

119
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,130
Mr to order today actors to detect

120
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,150
so the first thing that we've made is
that sad we use dynamic released now

121
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,669
when someone is making

122
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,299
is using tracking that's normally when
checking out make a search in Google or

123
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,639
on

124
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,949
a well-being tracking that would pursue
search results

125
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,810
and extract search keywords it will use
these keywords is an experienced so

126
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,410
as a prettier Easter furries we have
will involve

127
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,539
and as he said if his processes full
year under my son only

128
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,889
I am to users should not have the same
set of primaries

129
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,780
after like a week an a central banks
will not be able to feature is the only

130
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,530
for is made by tracking at

131
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,699
and you see that nursing thats a.m.
we've done is that we use no aris its

132
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,050
feet so when the user

133
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,970
is running track United any configure a
set of rss feeds

134
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,810
that will be used to extract keywords so
when trekking it is a is running

135
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,680
it will do a debt to do is if EADS purse

136
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,620
exam and XO XO matured since the 80's at

137
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,930
normally usery should be able to select
a.m.

138
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,160
said if feeds that are related to a
topic

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,379
an simulates some interest from that
topic so for example

140
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,580
let's assume you're not interested by
car but want to see the Mets

141
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,750
to have Google believing such your
interesting bike are you

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,539
you dressed find some aristide which
speak on you about cars

143
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,240
any a.m. as thats and then the

144
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,519
goetz's finance inquiry on your at it
but to bite

145
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,779
about car to Google you can do the same
thing for sports

146
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,000
I T E to if you find some website you
wishing to feed

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,480
and the you can and you want to see
relates an address for

148
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,140
I'll this website you just have to eat
ID to check me nuts

149
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,240
also from you probably know that certain
trying to give suggestion to users when

150
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,589
used

151
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,630
taking something on Hulu on Yahoo you're
receiving this

152
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,750
said if the search search terms it's

153
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,970
I i've suggested any normally

154
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,880
summit will Saturn points you can click
on them and so

155
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,320
we try to have them also integrating
trekking out so

156
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,480
in the same way that you can click on
Search suggestion a

157
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,899
tracking it also will simulate click
onto on the suggestions

158
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,320
we also changed the way we schedule
curry's it's not a

159
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,800
the fixed interval time now and are you
can configure it configure its

160
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,459
and case randomize also you can just add
fix the frequency

161
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:37,680
in fact that will a.m. a said set to

162
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,649
a send a query at San everette frequency
and two processes under my so anomalies

163
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:42,910
such

164
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,300
sometime soon that be able to future to
Cory's stress based on

165
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,149
thanks times

166
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,690
also is there is a curry burst when
trekking to detect that some users

167
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,920
is searching on your a certain time it
will send a set of query

168
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,990
a.m. to hide zur real

169
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,420
use a search and additional feature is
that now we use also dynamic your

170
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,050
URL so for example ish I'm sure
searching on Google France

171
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,350
as a yearling is not the same in fact
that format that

172
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,930
and also we're clicking on some

173
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,350
our search results so a if you

174
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,720
because users also I'm you can so

175
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,100
on some results when the went to get set
search results

176
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,880
and said is to try really to meet Althea
beat up the user

177
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,990
a.m. at anyone the right to use all
seems that we do not do ends

178
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,630
conditionally its we do not take on
sponsored results

179
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm because we don't know we do not want
to click on ads

180
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,100
its it will talk estimated took some
certificate fraud so I'm

181
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,250
and actually also when tracking that you
need to click on

182
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,910
searching on search results a it never
loads of contents

183
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,120
up to search results it stops

184
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,990
as a connection before so so is your
browser will never load

185
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,930
interested content

186
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,800
wilson's change the way we see meat
curries to section James initially we

187
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,190
were using just too much to cure crests

188
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,019
add dunno do to each day malcontents and

189
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,110
person it's pets no search engines
contain pictures feeds

190
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,260
the treats tennis trips that are running
into bars or so if you if we just

191
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,899
a.m. were don't know if that's without
springs a javascript with you

192
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,880
wheeze a.m. with your brother

193
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,010
sector nine might be able to detects
which carries out submitted by track me

194
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,839
nuts

195
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,570
so said he was sets we loads search page

196
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,089
in in an iframe in such a way that
C-sections I know

197
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,329
the I will send also contents to iframe

198
00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:00,120
as it will do to was a brother normally

199
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,000
and also we sing let's just work

200
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,190
in the search bar so so you're you will
receive two suggestions

201
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,389
and a certain time should not be able
just based

202
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:17,070
on server logs on to suggest service to
be able to feature tracking

203
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,149
very we also then looking to small icons
in that year's

204
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,230
his your old barn only

205
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,350
which for example for Google Usagi and

206
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,170
so nominees search and I'm also

207
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,579
is not able to future triggering at
Coreys based on that

208
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:40,399
and the primaries a frameset

209
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,990
can be easily detect Bay search inside
so which

210
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,200
we chains exist to use a brotherly
mention Firefox

211
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,320
which is exactly like your browser
that's you

212
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,380
use and

213
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,899
it's not know no it's not visible to the
user's bets

214
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,399
its she'll acts exactly as

215
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,740
visible brother and advantages that

216
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,010
also if records also search said

217
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,000
are made by tracking its in your browser
history so

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,760
normally take a lower ceilings as a
tracking it clicks on

219
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,290
in the same way as an if you really
sucks for exam

220
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,010
so alls yet cerise stinging attack based
on the incorporation

221
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,740
will not work well should be mitigated

222
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,230
three separate and yet

223
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,610
keep and and disrupt sense through

224
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,130
Demi events so we are dressed a.m.

225
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,550
sending all the events to 0

226
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,899
surgeons on page and normally eats it's
more robust so if

227
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:50,910
sunshine change something in seeing is a

228
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,230
JavaScript or interface and only

229
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,540
shoes track natural still runs I i jus

230
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,540
just try to make a doing

231
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,530
so I'm well normally these issues

232
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,060
he did you don't see its and thats well

233
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,400
tracking that process running and you
can see that it's typing L

234
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,130
likes you I will normally and you to
receive suggestion at some point it will

235
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,740
also keep on some suggestions

236
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,710
so she said just a key strokes events
that are sent to

237
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:38,870
Google and

238
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,330
if if I'm simulates several cue

239
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,590
several search with common keywords it
will just

240
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,550
well any kind of very might be generated
a.m.

241
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,000
and so it will try to just remove some

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,190
some sums some their arms from her

243
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:04,190
search

244
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,210
well actually notes we're not monitoring

245
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,840
well ideally I I will come sit by later
but will like to be able to

246
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,060
I'm when he tore of I so users type on
two key word there are 0

247
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,480
are you miles on the search page I am

248
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,560
fruit drink eat snacks implemented

249
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,279
would like to have something like that
to just be able to I really

250
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,529
users at its also we don't we do not
know at which minority

251
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,320
search engines are able to many
charities gonna events

252
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,350
yeah it's not implemented yet

253
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,830
also and will well

254
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,430
it's nuts same things we like to be able
to managers at NC

255
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,960
Wednesday finds a user click on did you
mean:

256
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,960
when you're sick search results

257
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,010
well a.m. noses

258
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,760
so far notices solution to really
control so the question is

259
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,640
as our words that are excluded
intentionally for that called

260
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,760
you trouble and country struggling no
and the only issue

261
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,770
confuse said if aristide a chilled usual

262
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,270
allow you to give some direction to the
said a few words that are used and butts

263
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,210
were like to have

264
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,320
something also allowing users to because
when's it said if

265
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,400
she was changed we we lose a control
abouts

266
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,410
or always a change in which as a career
that I use will accept some tools to

267
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,329
lets users

268
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,090
feature keywords so they can use
basically track note when they're

269
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,610
working

270
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,610
from her office

271
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,800
normally you can say differently so

272
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:25,929
thing

273
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,400
yes so you can't it's a tough

274
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,320
you can too different to 10 per minutes
then 5 per minutes and again

275
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,970
change that and it's Nate exactly said
well it's not if you said

276
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,400
10 permitted it won't be like 1 every
six seconds it will

277
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,700
be more or less like five ends in seven
seconds

278
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,590
later and it will like that yeah so it's

279
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,730
this randomized we try to keep the Sep
frequency

280
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,780
and normally any

281
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,990
also easy to use a perception an elite
will

282
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,560
Sen burst after it detects

283
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,220
user queries so as a Chinese not able to
know

284
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,280
when the user made enquiries not be able
to take first

285
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,770
your yet

286
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,590
well they recorded so far we just trying
to remove

287
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,370
remove them tonight pollutes so much as
bursary sorry it's

288
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,970
weekend remove that and exams brother is
story

289
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,970
yes

290
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,960
well it's under development actually
read some prototype we do that

291
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,480
which does that who comes out later and
between we are thinking about

292
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:10,480
so sorry

293
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,020
sows it was prescription well

294
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,700
except from settings RSS feed about a
particular topic

295
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:28,700
there is no set yeah

296
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,379
yeah it's well actually were you

297
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,299

so and only what we do is that

298
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:58,710
which rests take things RSS feed titles
and use

299
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,779
and does and remove holds a character
words that are

300
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:05,720
that do not start by capital letters
would try to assume that normally

301
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,690
worth starting was kept the leader's no
stop words

302
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm well probably will have to at you
stopped operating them into but the

303
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,890
thing is

304
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,240
that for you start to use used October

307
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,620
Firefox are well resent sis this week
actually we started to

308
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,420
version from which is quite basic now
because we don't have the same API on

309
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,860
crimes and we have in Firefox

310
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,170
it's just started to development star
liked

311
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,929
last week and you can download it from
the website

312
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,200
solve I don't know if yes some you have
some experience with Scrum

313
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,240
extension development assessing is
actually you have

314
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,260
background HTML page which is for

315
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,780
specific to every extension and what we
do is that we just creating iframe so

316
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,200
it's still in a frame snot

317
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,559
as good as with Firefox and we said to

318
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,129
Europe search as a source up to iframe
to

319
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,290
search page and what we do is well

320
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,360
said the correct implementation and that

321
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,020
next AP will be to inject a content
script insists

322
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,820
iframe to interact with it search bar

323
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,790
and also she makes you gone some sort
search results

324
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,559
sources are as a version that

325
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,340
off-track notes sets look now we have

326
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,780
diverse enough Firefox which is a more
complete so it's

327
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,530
runs with in a browser 19 an iframe will
also

328
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,530
have a passion for chrome

329
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,210
and saccharine also I this extension
system now

330
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,960
which is quite similar to the 1i to
extent extension stem

331
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,080
from and so for

332
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,889
internet explorer would test an iframe
which loads account thanks we have

333
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,450
no possibility to note some content
scripps

334
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,240
iframe do to some security restriction

335
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,500
as a search engines and you can search
on

336
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,510
you can search

337
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,040
on a well Baidu being I'm

338
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,300
Google and Yahoo

339
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,400
and if you search on Baidu's a series
that

340
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,540
you can also use changes RSS feeds so it
works

341
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:48,540
types Chinese directors actually here

342
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,120
I it's clear on is doctors sprint
ringtones rights

343
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,179
I am its search from Baidu and its

344
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,919
taking Chinese characters so you just
have to

345
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:04,570
I am going to your TechNet to use
Chinese rss feeds

346
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,649
and be sure that's its on you have a
Chinese characters and only chilled

347
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,559
usually works

348
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,450
so

349
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,630
what we are also trying to bring

350
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,040
as features now a.m. will XO's

351
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,570
it's really to the questions that you
had with would like to release inmates

352
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,320
a do user behavior so 10 distribution

353
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,689
if you're searching margarines the
weekend or if you noticing between

354
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,710
6&7 a.m.

355
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,000
tracking actual net search between six
and 7 a.m. and if you

356
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,340
searching twice during the weekend and
set you're doing during the week

357
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,590
track national search in the same way
also if your

358
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,590
almost always searching on being an ever
legal so

359
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,350
proportionally textile business should
be the same for tracking searching for

360
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,809
you your own search so

361
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:03,270
syntax would like to get some exit exit
your

362
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,200
back many quotes the user taking desi

363
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,040
ever type capital letters doesn't make
type this week tapers

364
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,070
and there's some certain times district

365
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,110
syntex for example if you ever search

366
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,590
with in URL our fight type our site
single

367
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,600
track doing doesn't it search like that

368
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,840
yes and would like to be able to also I
just kind of

369
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,490
elements including tracked so number of
suggestion accepted by the user

370
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,010
I V sing-sing we struck me nuts a

371
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:42,040
on any searches sessions the user have

372
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,639
well by searches and I mean when you
have

373
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,040
two consecutive search we sing our Terms
are whose

374
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,260
terms right to the same topic all
offended data cure

375
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,220
and when you have a situation belong to
them

376
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,060
as if that's an average and also

377
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,340
and would like to know what's what's a
professional

378
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,370
surgeons and as about you so I don't
know if you heard about Google Dashboard

379
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,380
basically city if you rotate our bikes
well

380
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,840
all the services that you use from
Google like gmail Google search

381
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,010
and all deserve it all the data sets
Daisy I have

382
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,390
you can see see them

383
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,190
on the services but a scenes that sits
on the raw data

384
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:31,050
it's not interpreted it as easy you have
no access to the profiles that's a bill

385
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:31,940
from set up

386
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,490
and the thing is a.m. for example
release able to you know

387
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,010
if someone as as if you before as a user
its

388
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,530
yourself as HS didn't do that based on
the

389
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,720
days search Dame search terms

390
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,600
if you're looking for us as if your
symptoms it's like she's at you as if

391
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,140
you

392
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,210
and the user bear along tonight's

393
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,090
infers that from you on searchers so we
like to have something that's will

394
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,070
lets the user a have some

395
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,939
some insight oppose about his profile

396
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,310
and we're also looking for is a super
was a source of keywords

397
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,360
to have some seems that you can use from
your office

398
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,810
and that's will not use an appropriate
terms

399
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,370
and we are adding sections lines like
their

400
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:28,370
HCPs version of Google and would like to
add also scored are

401
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,510
so it was a big question is does it work
I am

402
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,860
well with some reason to believe that's
it actually works

403
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,600
when use look for as it kind of printer
users that might be deployed by

404
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,770
searching giant

405
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,290
some paper two ish by people from
Microsoft

406
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,550
suggest that Chicana features a used to
identify search boats

407
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,350
are as praises made on the query so

408
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,380
mussah times a corresponding spam spam
words or

409
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,760
refer to outdo its contents are is
Aquarius use a terrific on the same day

410
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,460
sensitive keywords if so you sorry state

411
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,290
well is second receive to any queries
from

412
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,918
bro Zurich we can assume that's rivers
are is actually running

413
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,470
some search sums such boats

414
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,290
a some books just a much increases a
page rank

415
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,760
abate same page so they will kick always
on the same link

416
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,830
to as a petrenko this page increase

417
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,120
any as this page is too far as he will
have to keep fricassee on

418
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,860
next as a sis has a kinda futures thats

419
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,260
are used by so sometimes to

420
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,908
date detect view search boats some might
be user

421
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,070
as is well I i put a difference

422
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,428
here ever has been Commission 2008 so
same at

423
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,100
estimate they may have more elaborated
mechanism

424
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,309
now and when which

425
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:56,950
at attracting thats behave compared to
use its features

426
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,040
when you when we look at these features
well normally

427
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,280
not be detected by by

428
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,480
sounds is a certain times are base's
future

429
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,800
also yeah I will you too check your
search for five so you can go on his

430
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,929
page and you will see your search
provides

431
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:19,059
am well I'm not interested in cars or

432
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,399
country are role playing game so all
these

433
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,970
interest are actually some eighty by
Traci not

434
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,730
and wanted to be sure is that checking
out can actually impacts

435
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,830
use a search for a file so we run an
experiment with

436
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,649
10 a.m. to search for a fight and

437
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,150
we generated worries about different
topics with these profiles

438
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,110
ants try to see a.m. if a sec for is a

439
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,620
search for favor was impacted by

440
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,040
his queries and so we we had some
results where

441
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,490
a.m. profile re:

442
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,710
actually impacted a.m. normally if you
try to

443
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,380
I'm search about a certain topic we
struck me nuts

444
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,240
I am such as line will modify your
profile butts

445
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,630
will not ask consider also categories
that are

446
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,490
you did that are connected to this topic

447
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,070
and also it will add some a categories
that are not connected to

448
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,418
track as you to pick a track manatees
a.m. searching

449
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,540
about

450
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,129
so wide to the to track Norton and

451
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,500
be working well too difficult your
attorneys the same for every user so it

452
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,060
will takes

453
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:38,389
sometimes to evolve actually users eat a
change their default configuration

454
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:41,720
I'm a different set of keywords

455
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,250
butts a.m. wild two different matters

456
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,360
so we we have two said find some way to
improve that

457
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,790
am also it certain trying to detect
corporations about sells enough users

458
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,320
we're not able to do that we don't know
yet we do it have access to all these

459
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,040
profiles

460
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,500
a.m. I think last week

461
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,750
some research paper from yahoo has been
started

462
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,310
and say is it what what they did is that
the correlates

463
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,360
a.m. search queries wheeze demographic
data

464
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,440
and define that's there are some some
queries that are really characteristic

465
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,880
of its

466
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,990
a certain kind of population for example

467
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:25,030
well issue are searching for are ready
on

468
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,168
X 800 your poli

469
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:32,360
male and sees sheila is looking for

470
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,450
I think it's J chhu song lyrics

471
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,320
you're probably leave everything to me
from Asia and all these kind of things

472
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,990
that's

473
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,380
such an can in fare from has issued a
min update as they have

474
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:50,970
week weekend nights as it

475
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,690
what icing searching

476
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,620
such demographics I'm and really have

477
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,190
name I can find your

478
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,350
parents and also tracking it cannot hide
your identity

479
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,630
so each you search for your name on
Google we'll

480
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:13,960
well probably it will appear as as
different

481
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,010
from the track not searchers scene is

482
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,129
at some point we'll we had a futures
which generated

483
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,370
some sort of social security number

484
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,810
so is that it will segments as is
security nurse a social security numbers

485
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,490
to such enzymes and

486
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,790
but we did nets

487
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,879
developed different that anymore and
maybe you we will

488
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,970
also tracking it does not lets you do it
search

489
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,980
in second thanks to trucks I'm series

490
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,360
when I run track for a long time my

491
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,179
very old worries are deleted from my
Google search for five

492
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,940
and Charlotte on these are originated by
tracking at butts

493
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,880
all my is search

494
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,940
are dated by rule butts

495
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,429
its probably stays search logs

496
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,070
and so actually wells ons worries

497
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,740
defense so it depends what exactly

498
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,320
work mean do we want reckoned to be
detectable

499
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,100
as it seems beginning world

500
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,179
collector check not being able to

501
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:32,399
well leg to sentencing considers that
mean maybe

502
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,830
every user is using tracking nuts if
that's the case

503
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,928
a sinister committed detected by a
certain time as soon as its use it

504
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:45,639
is addicted well considers that we
failed

505
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:48,639
so is that's it is a failure what if

506
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:53,780
ninety-nine percent of trickery is going
to be fact by a certain time

507
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,700
should we consider that it's your
workings are I means there is still one

508
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,120
percent

509
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,200
well probably not but what if fifty
percent of my query is my own search

510
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,710
queries also flagged and deleted by

511
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,980
search logs actually is our

512
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,800
there is a paper which use machine
learning

513
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,200
a reason to try to future tracking at
Currys and on average

514
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,399
I'm is a deleted like 50 percent

515
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:22,750
if a.m. usurper respects

516
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,090
be able to remove like nineteen 9.9
percent of

517
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,520
taking it for as well it wasn't evil
configuration and on a previous version

518
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,290
of trekking out but still

519
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,649
and well normally for spam filter

520
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:39,030
if you did text ninety-nine percent as
spam but

521
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,918
deets fifty percent of your real such

522
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,010
real me sage email sorry

523
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,879
a well considers that it's not working
but this scene is

524
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:54,270
well what if certain time for ninety
percent make for his body still able to

525
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,720
provide an adequate actually

526
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,030
maybe i'd maybe I want to and my profile
I'm not interested in such a dangerous

527
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,230
deleting

528
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,879
some specific search queries I'm

529
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:12,350
an a so when a protective what was to
make it harder for such inventive

530
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,389
read user logs an the question is

531
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,600
which will be to cause for such intense
on me for what

532
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,899
race you up for it should be dropped to
be able to

533
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:28,629
get some information if well safe drops
ninety percents

534
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:33,139
actually consider a world that weeks
succeed at some point

535
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,379
and do you want to make the perfect
unreadable generate noise and curries

536
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,779
results specific targets and

537
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,580
about any topic so i'd spines was such a
giant

538
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,600
won't be able to infer anything from or
search logs

539
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,060
or do we want to be able to modify
certain certain time

540
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,440
as its search for fide based on track on
track not search

541
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,750
and world we're really want to have any
kind of curry

542
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,810
sent by track me nuts if he wants to
have something like

543
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,120
i doing a in every user to

544
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,759
say that's its own crew vs be generated
by tracking at even if he's not using

545
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,500
track tonight

546
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,980
week we would like to have any potential

547
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,400
search be generated by tracking at

548
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,960
and if its well

549
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,020
does is shoot curry made by tracking
that senior

550
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,960
this year only two your prairies that's
more realistic

551
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,339
thats a.m.

552
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,509
so a.m. well we have pose this question
any

553
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,640
back to add your feedback so where we
have will Building Committee on Get

554
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,730
Satisfaction

555
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,280
0 is here get satisfaction that comes
extracting at

556
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,370
and I'm so we're open to feedbacks if
you have any feedback

557
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:55,440
like even sings that just kind of Korea
generated by tracking items are not

558
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,410
released

559
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,730
realistic so week add some regular
expressions features am

560
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,250
if a you lack

561
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,600
to if you like to have tracking a.m.

562
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,609
able to access additional features you
can suggested

563
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:18,880
also if you if there are some critics
about track notes that

564
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,020
you want from late-season sis is gonna
suggestion and

565
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,800
a.m. well sees tracking it also evolved
based on

566
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,350
critics and if you have

567
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,710
any excuse that you want to try and take
notes

568
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,760
please feel free to do so we don't have

569
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,030
any setup data so we can I X

570
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,120
test tracking us on user data see if

571
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,690
tracking it varies are different fuser
curry's

572
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,290
but if you want to do that on your own
furries arm I could even

573
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:55,900
give a set of them my on search loves

574
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,109
if you want to try to train some
mechanism to detect

575
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:05,580
checking it for is are if you see that
there are some things

576
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,859
at the network level which differentiate
track tonight search

577
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,220
from use a search and so is this is a

578
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:19,220
web sites year olds web sites if you
have any question

579
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,600
it detects

580
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,319
well actually is based on 0 your L so
there is a

581
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,920
regular expression which detects a URL
normally its

582
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,450
the religious search so as soon as you
mean to search in a more youthful

583
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:07,450
trigger burst yeah yeah

584
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,089
yeah let's that's why we have also the
frequency which

585
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,650
well we have bows frequency and summers
might not only

586
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:27,530
it will generate such at a given
frequency

587
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,790
an where nature is a torrential

588
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:35,560
will be able to know if which exactly is
a search that figure to burst

589
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,279
so yeah if you set the frequency

590
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,380
like one every hour and Zen you have

591
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,760
s you search in the middle of the hour
its

592
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,760
it work yes

593
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,250
generally a

594
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,560
your icing I don't exactly over bush-era

595
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,080
works isometric its basins a really but
US redirects

596
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,290
as traffics through zigal sharing proxy
so

597
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,930
normally actually it also works with
people sharing

598
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:29,930
yeah

599
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:35,670
so I think it's twenty percent so this
is a is a number of countries that are

600
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,829
two extra hours

601
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:40,099
20 percent I will so as I say will do so

602
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:44,650
like to add some things that will need
to reserve a frequency of you click

603
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,069
through and eventually

604
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:49,700
which is their rank up to page which is
clicked on

605
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,099
search results so if for example the
user is on keeping on

606
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,630
firsts search results at something like
that

607
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:03,630
assigned to recognize yes

608
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,640
yeah

609
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,480
January good yeah

610
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:34,140
so them

611
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,890
generally for a situation we were
switching well so that's

612
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,100
why I'm we assume keystrokes Research
Park so that it works

613
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,880
automatically get some suggestion for

614
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,880
from Google and from as a certain time
as well yes

615
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,269
no well actually

616
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:06,680
granted may not work for an enterprise
because we're not able to

617
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,430
I'm really well week if someone want to
distract from its enterprise it

618
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,519
it's risky cuz there's a rich is gonna
keywords I'm

619
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,109
but seeing is well as I say was

620
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:25,819
rss feeds which works I'm I don't know
if resets

621
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:30,538
tracking its on a proxy from Enterprise
on many furries it regenerates to be

622
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:34,150
a realistic probably too much and maybe
tool

623
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,160
the flag main maybe notes I'm butts

624
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:46,160
well it might be in yours interesting
idea yeah

625
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,279
wells at securing some it's a
current-mode actually so that's

626
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,510
to retool granted

627
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,770
yeah its its said fix

628
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:25,770
frequency yes

629
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,560
what kind of your article

630
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,690
on okay on on so will you back to be
able to add

631
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,310
systems are 10 times I'm well actually

632
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,540
to add a certain time we just have to at
some read regular expression

633
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,970
which correspond to certain time a
search for a row know it's

634
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,330
its not such before 2i a single sitting
down with just

635
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,210
its icing we have to just add some

636
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,830
regular expression if you know 0 and
know where's the search terms

637
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,230
are well trees

638
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,520
dropped its not possible from the option

639
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,200
window affect me nuts and maybe we'll
make that

640
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,960
possible its its essential be a

641
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,960
yeah you talk

642
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,530
well

643
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,819
seasonally you're making searching on
you in Fairfax is open so

644
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:04,560
like that we're able to Matt I'm

645
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,790
user or user habits so

646
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:12,430
if user is on you have these bars opened

647
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,279
during weekend Mitchell work and have to

648
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,960
you too many towers a frequency you can

649
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,760
have zippers or running background

650
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,369
no no

651
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:32,510
its its well to seize by as

652
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,970
extension runs a parser a little too old
to permit a front about the cookies

653
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:40,720
also you sergeant and so it's really we
really able to

654
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,170
simulates the same sorts of power meters

655
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:52,170
user yes

656
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:14,260
I'm did could you repeat

657
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,560
well yeah I know I'd it's clear

658
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,619
well if by any chance tracking at

659
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:54,970
is able to generate sees for queries
that ratified

660
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,980
you you can assume that's

661
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,250
will will reconnects you always

662
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:05,859
sarong computer Mets

663
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:09,078
as I say we don't have access to all
data so we're not

664
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,640
able to know exactly y Garza

665
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,980
furry that are characteristic for some
users but what

666
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,320
what it is signature users

667
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,910
I'm I'm not really sure actually that's

668
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,549
we to generate sets

669
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,910
specific which reducing said set
specific search

670
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:35,259
as I'd often I don't like when you take
a look at

671
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,040
at your searches 3 most of the time is

672
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,230
well I i can. on you speak from my own
searches for its

673
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,770
quite Generac searches so but we

674
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,000
without having access to alls a.m.

675
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,130
so 298 out we're not able to really
answers

676
00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:01,700
sector
