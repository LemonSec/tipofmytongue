1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,560
are not having a slight but actually
cover for it's old school space to give

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,390
presentations

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,019
I really this is about telephone entry
systems which of the most people are

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:11,660
familiar with

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,809
if you've ever seen the keypads outside
a building that you touch just like a

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:15,150
phone

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,290
simply not seen a keypad like outside
the door

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:23,009
as a maybe not seem

9
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:28,919
for are to the question is really

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,230
is there anyone not familiar with the
keypad entry system right everybody is

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,040
okay cool

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,460
so miss gonna go through four things
here

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,690
and a good introduction for going over
in overview after

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,379
systems are talking about details then
we'll talk about the exploits that I

15
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,019
found

16
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:48,309
many which are public and I'll talk
about my philosophy exploits as well

17
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,108
and then opportunities nice

18
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:59,109
key open second life

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,270
right

20
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,259
that's way less fun has been described
as

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:25,260
cool stuff not as fun against my name's
Dhabi

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,670
I miss Davi others my 16 year
information security

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,850
so pretty happy with its what I like to
do and last year when full-time

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,910
independents are in a company called
flying penguin

25
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,450
its been going pretty well back to
probably consider hiring here pretty

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:41,850
soon

27
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,229
I'm kinda country and i think that I got
into this and its

28
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,950
I think notes from a bad thing to say
but I've been using Macintosh for 21

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,340
years now and I just this year when Tali
Arbel 3

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,130
was like my big thing I just got it all
but

31
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,060
that's kinda my philosophy like the hard
road is sometimes the more interesting

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,210
and fun road so

33
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,430
that's not exactly how I got into this
particular case but all talk about that

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:06,840
later

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,709
want things I do with big companies is
talk about secures compliance

36
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,310
people ask me all the time what's the
difference and I just make this one

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,760
point because I think it's pretty simple

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,899
really securities personal like if you
feel secure have a security cage thats

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,080
your decision but every time we talk
about compliance you talk about it in

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,519
terms of everyone else so it's like

41
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,400
at these two people are more so two
people have an idea security the get

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,970
together

43
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,760
that's compliance color green with one
another and that's what I'm gonna talk

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,630
about here because in terms of locks

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,250
you know at least buildings I lived in I
wouldn't sit inside

46
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,930
think there's something on the front
door that protects me from people

47
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,580
getting in

48
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,690
and I have a sense of compliance it's
not just security I haven't gone down

49
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,930
tested it myself

50
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,730
I believe that there's some degree of
compliance to a standard error code

51
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,890
love what key locks should provide and I
know these conferences are I'm not seem

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,769
like you like

53
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:56,850
presentations every single time I got a
hacker conference for the past however

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,640
many years

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,510
and its popular and I thought no one
ever talks about his keypad systems

56
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,489
least I haven't seen one

57
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,590
so I thought what the heck the title is
easy

58
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,750
packs for a reason is a really simple
hacks and I'll talk about that

59
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,430
in terms of compliance not so much in
terms of security be could go either way

60
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,430
so the risk calculations I just bring
that up because

61
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,900
I think a lot of this is risk like it
depends where you live but I've

62
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,550
I live in a neighborhood that actually
is pretty dangerous gets broken into a

63
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:21,990
lot

64
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,250
price I actually didn't think that would
be the case that is pretty safe but

65
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,420
as I found out assert monitoring I
noticed a lot of stuff is getting broken

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,530
into and that's kinda how I got involved
in this

67
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,620
somebody asked me manager asked me to
take a look at some systems

68
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,800
so when I look at risk a look at the
assets are protected

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,910
in this case would be somebody's
apartment ur somebody's business

70
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,270
the vulnerabilities right which most
people don't know

71
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,819
like you walk up to a building you can
look at this keypad systems but my not

72
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,560
actually test them we may not be
familiar with them maybe have installed

73
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,910
them

74
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,930
seems to be the way most people figure
out what abilities is that

75
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,510
installing themselves and immediately
they go well this is how these things

76
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,730
are built and the threats

77
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,730
sir when I talked a little bit you know
it's hard to gauge threats in

78
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,660
neighborhoods like you can look at
certain signs graffiti is one

79
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,230
there's a whole criminally study of the
structure colonel behavior

80
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,959
and the philosophy what begets crime but
if you look at certain signs

81
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,420
things in the neighborhood you can sort
of put two and two together the more

82
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,229
keypad entry systems you see probably
the more crime that's been in that

83
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:17,810
neighborhood

84
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,608
which is ironic when we get red rested
his presentation when you see what's

85
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:22,320
really going on

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,050
and then after gmail spiel about white
versus black as I consider myself

87
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,150
totally white hat I don't really do

88
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,810
on a black hat and the difference for me
is surely often authorization so

89
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,390
somebody asks me to do something I will
but I want initiate an attack on a

90
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,940
system

91
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,950
a someone said would you please test
this and that's entirely with this

92
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,020
presentation is about

93
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,690
so I do a lot of work with the company's
mass media tests and penetration testing

94
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,930
about for a long time

95
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,910
but in this particular case I was
specifically asked to look at this box I

96
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,229
probably would have done it otherwise it
would be really mad

97
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:54,340
and known what was going on but in this
case they said can you look inside

98
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,690
and then finally there's this whole
exploit versus like oh my god

99
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,440
it's an exploit and for me next week is
just a flaw we find all the time you

100
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,590
know like a tire goes flat

101
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,370
its maybe next play great it's maybe
something you should know about

102
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,620
somebody's done something to you maybe
it's something you should have

103
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,080
consider any but the tire it always
reminds me this time I did a penetration

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,789
tester

105
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,550
a company that was it was a really big
company and they're bringing in some

106
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,479
really big names

107
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,050
so for example you might say it was like
Apple Nike Mr Microsoft IBM were using

108
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,470
this

109
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,060
posted facility and we did some testing
where we went in to see if they couldn't

110
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,240
see each other's data and right away we
could see each

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,070
you know a could see BB could see a and
I was working with the guy who

112
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,719
I don't know how we got securities
ghetto truck driver and

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
I was talking about his life and he was
like a really cool guy but as soon as we

114
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,698
found this I said

115
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,199
look at this is ridiculous know they can
see into each other stuff you literally

116
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,770
stood up through its arms up and running
down the hall

117
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,870
exploit exploit and likely told
everybody you know

118
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,870
systems totally screwed only have to
know and I try to avoid that like

119
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,880
sensationalizes

120
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,710
but in this case I really I just try to
get the word out because like I say I've

121
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,530
seen on the physical key lock

122
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,760
breaking and I haven't seen on the
keypad stuff discussed

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,500
okay sauna for that stuff the overview
really is going to be about telephone

124
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,430
entry systems

125
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,979
and it's about remote entry so you wanna
let somebody in and they're far away and

126
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,758
you want to use the telephone system

127
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
because it has a keypad already designed
and Bayview than a multi-unit dwellings

128
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,680
so it's convenient have lots of people

129
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,620
allow multiple people in so that's
really the whole concept here

130
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,180
and you see there an actual diagrammatic
pulled off want the vendor sites

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,780
which shows you what you're getting
yourself into any by one of these things

132
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,850
your display

133
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,210
you have that post a lock speaker so
they can hear you talking right

134
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,540
this'll be familiar and an enclosure
lock no I think before I did this

135
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,009
research research to see termed

136
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,000
I think before I did this I would look
at this and not yet the box right

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,120
there's a key it's pretty familiar stuff
it even looks like a safe deposit box to

138
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,990
use all the time

139
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,490
but after I went through the stuff I did
and I look at this I just go home I got

140
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,900
thats whats protecting me

141
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,110
so hopefully that's the reaction yoga at
the end its presentation that's really

142
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,210
what I'm looking for

143
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,919
and the way it usually works as you have
a list of names that have been dialed

144
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,960
that have been programmed in

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,180
so we put on the dial pad code for the
name so

146
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,190
1234 maybe your name code so 1234
answers and then the press a key

147
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,770
and that key is really a number so the
press a six or nine

148
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,400
typically I found they don't change very
often and another unique

149
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,360
so you can already start to see the
problems because that's it for the QB

150
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,389
the key itself as a six-run ninth own
unlocks the door

151
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,630
and their lots of them out there I did
not test multiple units it did occur to

152
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:27,930
me

153
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,419
to start a campaign where to go around
the city and look at every single keypad

154
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:31,969
system

155
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,960
but again I was not authorized to do
that I have not done I would recommend

156
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,509
somebody get authorized to do that

157
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,740
and you have study I really like to see
the results but there are a lot of

158
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,610
different systems made by law to
different vendors this one focuses on

159
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,590
just one that I was asked to look at

160
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,240
and that Centex when i think is owned by
Chamberlain have a look into it that

161
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,070
not much detail I did find from their
advertisements

162
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,969
marketing literature they say they're
committed to safety reliability of

163
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,090
course your gonna say that if you saw
locks

164
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,150
and their engineers quality machine work
and rugged construction

165
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,400
of course in again marketing very rugged
construction that's key

166
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,800
we get to the end its presentation and
then they say

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,100
they have a partnership network have
trained service technicians

168
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,310
this also is a key because I find a lot
of these devices are sold from a vendor

169
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,680
who doesn't really stand up to or
service them stand up to them

170
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,350
as a company once they're in the field
in other words they deploy them but they

171
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,350
rely on locksmiths other people too

172
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,860
basement implement them and take care of
them and maintain them

173
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,589
and I'll talk about that later but you
can imagine already you know what

174
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:33,300
happens

175
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,750
similar situation locks rate you buy a
lock for some guy he doesn't make

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,979
blockages puts it in but those guys know
a lot about how to break the locks

177
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,500
people these things and they studied the
same things happening in this field as

178
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,380
well

179
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,430
so use overview well overview

180
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,829
it would be the Centex telephone entry
system spectrum DI

181
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:55,370
but I'm looking at DI is for the their
directory inserts on the right side

182
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,699
there's a piece of paper that goes
inside

183
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:02,390
and this is a fifteen hundred dollar
roughly it could be more or less

184
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,620
device that someone would buy for their
front door now

185
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,550
from a security perspective unless you
realize that you have to open this

186
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,310
every time but this piece a paper in are
you when I think well what's up what

187
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,569
else is inside the box

188
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,760
in fact for security perspective is
designer you might say I wanna make sure

189
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,839
you can just put that piece a paper in
the market take it out without affecting

190
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,319
the internals at the box

191
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:25,370
so again looking at this at face value

192
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,360
you might assume that's what's going to
design in a way that would be secure

193
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,220
when in reality

194
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,120
you have to open entire box to put that
piece of paper in and that's the

195
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,940
difference between

196
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,740
a directory insert and a non directory
answer the convenience they just added

197
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,110
completely exposes the inside the box

198
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,230
so that's sort of what we're talking
about again with the overview

199
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:46,660
the spectrum guys take the market this
as durable and vandal resistant

200
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,520
talking about the specific box now that
the box that it comes in as a family

201
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,589
resistant box

202
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,980
and it uses an existing telephone
network so you're

203
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,819
King it into existing wires you'll have
to rewire basically trying to save you

204
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,069
money that's why they say

205
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,189
you can save thousands of dollars by
putting this system into your

206
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:06,829
anti-environment so the bottom line
there's a trying to say

207
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:09,179
spend fifteen hundred dollars just think
how much money you'll save on

208
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:10,350
implementation

209
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,429
but they're not saying is this thing is
if you

210
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:16,709
boil it down you look at these three but
they're not really saying is will stand

211
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:17,929
behind our products on

212
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:22,240
breaks into it right so

213
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,640
going back to the keypad how it works I
was I would assume a lot of people's

214
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,709
conference maybe everybody's familiar
with the

215
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,350
DTMF which is just spread as a 2600
concept so you press the button and it

216
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,179
gives a tone

217
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,179
and the tones are based on to sounds
right so each year the press on the

218
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,510
store

219
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,569
pieces are than that on the keypad going
out the door is gonna

220
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:45,040
make a tone and the tone is to combine
frequencies which you can obviously

221
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,089
replicate

222
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,589
so in the old system earthquakes changes
used to work is there to take those

223
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,339
tones and it for two binary in the
kiddos to computers things with it but

224
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,640
and the sense that these are still
analog there's no real computer back

225
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,540
there they're just moving it owns around

226
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,380
and so I'll jump right into the first
exploit obviously can replicate the tone

227
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,280
so my first thought on this actually was
well that wouldn't work because you have

228
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,199
the dow someone's number but then I
realized is pressed her

229
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,650
the pound but then it gives you a dial
tone so it's listening and the press the

230
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,650
tonality when it's pretty awesome

231
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:20,230
so the doesn't always work but only
certain systems are like this apparently

232
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,750
but and I I won't go into too much
detail about what works for me what

233
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,819
didn't work but I have felt these
exploits

234
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,829
are definitely worth testing I would say
that

235
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:31,970
so the correct frequency is all you have
to do to mimic a keypress

236
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,709
and you can get the door open obvious in
the case we had to dial somebody they

237
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:36,449
would have to

238
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,819
say you know I answered in the press it
on but if you can get to the point where

239
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,860
again for security design perspective
you can get to the point where it's

240
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,799
giving you the same

241
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,309
interface as they've given you and you
put that tone in which is very easy

242
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,329
playback special today's phones

243
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,439
urine and their charts all over the
place tell you exactly which towns which

244
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:56,260
keys it's not like it's this a secret
stuff

245
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,290
ok it's explained to you has been widely
discussed in the web I really don't feel

246
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,719
bad about talking about this

247
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,970
but I still find people don't know it so
i thought id share anyway that is the

248
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,990
vendor defaults

249
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,880
right you go on these boxes and a lotta
apartment managers or building managers

250
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,079
aren't really savvier don't care about
configuring these things they put it in

251
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,770
and they say look for secure

252
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,809
when in reality they haven't changed
default password which is all serious

253
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:21,199
and so if you walk up to a box this is a
minute he explained particular

254
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,290
if you walk up to the spot this is what
was discussed by the on the web to walk

255
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,339
up to a box you press star three times

256
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,799
you press the password which is usually
zeros and the 99

257
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,130
pound is the command to get you in so 99
pound of you put in the password opens

258
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,620
the doors

259
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,240
what people don't realize that there's
all these sequence codes you can program

260
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,069
in multiple passwords so some of them
have features

261
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,579
delighted have key codes you don't even
need your key to that building anymore

262
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,510
cuz you can start punching the key codes
to get in the building

263
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,819
usually they're not set up that way user
setup

264
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,429
where they should be set up so that one
person has a password that is used to

265
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:56,030
configure the system and the lock it
away securely

266
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,130
effect is a way that you can verify the
pastor has been entered probably because

267
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,910
screwed up you can get back in the
system have to reset it which'll

268
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,770
which show you here is just star star
star 2010

269
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,850
you can just go to reset the box to your
view on some other allied

270
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,689
reason to factory defaults you like I
but the passwords 0000

271
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:19,530
and I can open the door so they're
definitely some strange flaws in how

272
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,280
easy it is to program these

273
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,929
the programming interface actually is is
super super simple

274
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,860
and this is probably really cool like in
the early eighties are made in the late

275
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,709
seventies but

276
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:31,839
in today's technology like you can
imagine the Gypsy to put in the things

277
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,870
you could do the interface the program
could do with these things

278
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,770
you like a touchscreen did scroll for
fingerprint on

279
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,970
anyway we get to the the third exploit

280
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,770
and that's kinda based on the second one
right so they're so easy to program

281
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,799
they're so easy to get into a
programming mode

282
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,530
that you can go on a certain messing
around with them and if you open them up

283
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,860
there's actually program button

284
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,900
on a lot of them so that's pretty cool
we push the program but

285
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,900
anything to start working on others also
keep that option

286
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,920
so if you wanna go into program mode
which already saw was star star star in

287
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,809
six zeros

288
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,880
all other stuff honestly I pulled writer
the instruction guide which can download

289
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,410
anywhere

290
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,870
right you just go I wanna see a cent tax
and i wanna see this model

291
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,319
I don't see how to install it and it
says here's the password and here's the

292
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,160
program mode

293
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,520
and here's the network his the diagram
inside a circuit board

294
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,410
and how it works she later so there's
also an exit option

295
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,699
so you wanna stay there they warn you
don't stay in program somebody might use

296
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:27,199
it believes

297
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,189
maybe I wasn't supposed to use the first
place and so 00 star has a timeout to

298
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:35,140
settle knock you out after 60 seconds or
something

299
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,230
who see the tennis to verify your
password: as if you do go on happen to

300
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,559
these

301
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,569
take it over you probably wanna make
sure your password free

302
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:44,980
disconnector makes it back to the
original another person thing

303
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,520
the feature set I wanted to show the
feature set for these boxes cuz it's so

304
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,660
long it's like amazing the things that
they really can do with others analog

305
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,410
a programming the source this is one
example I thought would be interesting

306
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,350
so you can remotely control the firmware
and every single sent text box

307
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,520
apparently since 1995 has had this
feature

308
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,189
and if you actually physically located
you can press and hold the program but

309
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,189
ministers 072

310
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:13,410
and that allows Eurocontrol so now you
can dial in from anywhere and you can go

311
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,829
in

312
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,890
settings as you wish again how
convenient that they're using

313
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,020
you know standard parts or mail
telephone

314
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,250
so you can I guess what you set that up
for yourself as an attack you can come

315
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,140
back and

316
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,730
make changes adding key codes right see
getting anyone noticing

317
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,640
right number four silent keys which is
basically just picking the lock

318
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,650
but difference here is that when you
pick the lock there's a postman keefer

319
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,120
stubble

320
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,220
and the postman key can be programmed so
that did

321
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,059
only allows them into a specific the
mail area you know you have the man trap

322
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,770
essentially so they come in the first
door

323
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,410
mailboxes are there but the kick in the
second or my study

324
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,520
again I'll did a very limited looked at
my study found that nobody bothers to

325
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,230
set the two doors because it involves

326
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,160
different relays of different wires much
easier to just put everything back

327
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,610
plug it in right save money so the
postman comes in

328
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,040
it buzzes and usually here she doesn't
know if they're getting into both doors

329
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
wonder sometimes they can't I suppose
but

330
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,679
what I found is that very rarely are
they set up properly and the control

331
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,579
relay

332
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:17,299
it's gonna be key later the control
really is known to be just

333
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:22,439
a simple way when they put the key in
the Internet it just sends a signal

334
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,510
basically jumps to you peace medal and
then them they're inside the building

335
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,520
the auxiliary is the same concepts you
might have seen

336
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,949
buttons have to punch to get out of a
building size magnets have to touch the

337
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,250
magnets has to be like an actual

338
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,520
person's hand same thinks he can wire in
those and then you can have an override

339
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,720
both these exploits are very easy
obviously to interface with

340
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,689
like pull apart that button you know are
you get something else that would be

341
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:46,569
able to give you

342
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:50,689
access somewhere else he could run wires
its place in the current swirls and push

343
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:51,400
that button

344
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,579
on the outside for example so the
postman and the auxiliary

345
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:59,040
quite a few options if you want to see
wiring we want to do a pic

346
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,100
pick the lock okay so number five this
is really with the presentation

347
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,540
boils down to so there's an epidemic a
break ins in

348
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,819
San Francisco well all over the city of
course and this map

349
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,329
which you see on the right is an actual
topographical chart

350
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,849
of crime which some guys did I keep a
blog I wrote about this a while back but

351
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,609
that stuff over on the right that's
really tall is the highest amount a

352
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,990
crime see a vandalism

353
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,419
assaults right comics in certain parts
of town

354
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,669
so there's this big epidemic not in that
mountain is pure Park

355
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:33,190
actually a little bit overweight or to
the valley were kinda flat and

356
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,690
two people were arrested in March this
year and the

357
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,950
apparently had been running a circuit
for 60 months at least so when the

358
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,490
police busted them

359
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,190
and the bus them based on fingerprints
because they left their fingerprints at

360
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,919
the scene of a crime

361
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,730
and there's a surveillance camera so
they had a suspect who is this guy on

362
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,620
the person

363
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,080
ironically and they went and they found
five truckloads

364
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,490
stuff in this apartment so took them
five full police

365
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,570
giant you know semi trucks to clean up
the apartment stolen goods

366
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,059
and it sort of started people wondering
like how are they getting into these

367
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:03,580
places

368
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,720
because there was a rash of break-ins in
a broken windows and stuff there were a

369
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,760
lot of empty buildings they were going
into

370
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,870
but they're also lot reports people
canning stuff stolen

371
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,620
I was in broad daylight or random times
with no damage to buildings

372
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,809
right stuff is getting like lifted
writer the hallways and

373
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,820
this is where manager building contact
because they had stuff

374
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,399
on the walls in there sir interior space
that was just being taken so arcs

375
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:30,210
mirrors furniture anything in like
secure garage is all the stuff is

376
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,279
disappearing

377
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,179
yet there is no evidence of any break in
right now we can figure out how they're

378
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:34,830
coming in

379
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,299
where they're going so one day when they
contacted me they said

380
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,700
you know in our box is broken too sites
not working must've

381
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,590
messed with it the postman take it in
our meals like and delivered

382
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,980
so it took a look and I've noticed I
know if you can see this a try to make

383
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,679
it really clear but the top

384
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,070
my hand there yes %uh the top there's a
little tiny lips

385
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,840
that's been bent up just strategically
placed right above that key lock

386
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,809
if you notice the lower left there's the
postman q2 right to have their own

387
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,740
separate key very secure looking

388
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,130
but at the top there's that just tiny
the lip so you start to ask like how

389
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,970
vandal resistant is this the coffin that
medalists right

390
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,559
that's like tiny like 30 seconds an inch

391
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,789
so I did a quick assessment is by
looking at a bike

392
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,019
taking my hand in opening and I was like
wow this has a single lever

393
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:24,220
like with the picky the u-turn sometimes

394
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,269
puts bolts to decide right you turn the
key and has to bolsa go through holes

395
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,850
for example so it has much more
resistance thus has a tail

396
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,309
fingers for that moves up and down so by
prying that up you just

397
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,809
you prying a 7-inch maybe or less you
can do with your key

398
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,519
you could do it with a screwdriver so
that was the first from minors

399
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,960
very thin construction on ladies boxes
nicer walking around looking at the

400
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,789
boxes again I was doing an assessment
but i just want to know is this typical

401
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:48,289
on

402
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:52,669
pretty much yeah a lot of them have this
very thin metal box

403
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,909
I don't think it would matter if it was
flush because you'd still be able to pry

404
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:59,380
in some cases to get in just it matters
how that la c'est

405
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,029
is configured like how that lip is how
much purchase it gets when it's locked

406
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,509
and so the second thing I noticed here
is that it was closed but was unlocked

407
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,240
so this was in unlock state like this
with the lock

408
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,460
actually turned to a locked state and
that's because the invented just enough

409
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,600
so you could take your hand

410
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,710
whole and it was just barely touching it
so the resistance

411
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,929
in other words we could walk up to this
at any time today just

412
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,740
sir pried open and that really mean it
matters

413
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,659
is what it looks like when you open it
because when you pop it open it's just

414
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:29,669
an empty box

415
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,769
it's ridiculous its there's no
protection at all the circuit board

416
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:36,130
and incidentally this is how your place
in the beginning I was talking at the

417
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,809
paper

418
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,190
so if you wanna be an apartment manager
and people move in a new value like

419
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,259
going out after place this you're
constantly opening this box and

420
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,620
closing this box and looking at the
circuit board and what you see our

421
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,070
cables jumpers and labels so why is
important

422
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,610
well first ball you can tell from cable
secure flirt circuit boards if you've

423
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,220
messed around with computers are

424
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,179
messed around all initial electronics
you can tell it the cables essentially

425
00:20:58,179 --> 00:20:58,470
do

426
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,980
summer meant to be pulled off some in to
be put on some connect

427
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,960
circuit boards together for example see
no that's for the communication channels

428
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,669
are going

429
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,039
it's just really easy to figure out
what's going on these boards because a

430
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,009
really simple

431
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:12,070
and the second is the jumpers well that
means their signal is being jumped so

432
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,279
you're always gonna do something if you
start jumping the manual incident having

433
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,850
computer have these things do it for a
signal and labels

434
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,399
course well you know if it says touch
your to break in

435
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:27,610
and that's exactly what it says so
subtle a row you know it's pouring here

436
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,820
I noticed the board has little

437
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,200
a civil statement there's all printed
word and

438
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,690
at first I was like how does that say
and I thought does this really matter

439
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,419
because I looked at the board were
closer I realized

440
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,720
there aren't a lot of jumpers that I
would mess with anyway

441
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,279
they're not going to tell you all the
faults are you can figure out yourself

442
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,179
but I'll a point this one out because
it's

443
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,440
in the instructions i download I'll tell
you that right so

444
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,639
we talked about the post a lock and how
they have to get in and the turn the key

445
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:55,350
in the

446
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,639
the get a signal well on the board it
says post a lock

447
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:02,259
and it has a very simple jumper like the
most simple jumper you can imagine

448
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,279
here's a highlight

449
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,820
right people that I of says postal
ocupada of any touch it with anything

450
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,029
metal

451
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,129
yet so if you're a screwdriver and you
want to break in one that's never been

452
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:15,029
broken into you

453
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,519
pop in touch it and then you walk away
and takes less than 10 seconds

454
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,480
I would say less than five seconds if
one's already been broken into of course

455
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,470
you don't have to

456
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,240
bring history ever you can just pried
open use your key bike I'm gonna open my

457
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,330
door is Mikey

458
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,889
and touch the post a lock doesn't have
to fit the lock is looking up

459
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:35,990
and in this particular case the reason
that the system was broken and they ask

460
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,179
you to look at it was

461
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,480
because they had put that jumper back on
incorrectly so they pulled it off and

462
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,269
put it back on to hide their tracks

463
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:45,990
and I founded and in a way that was like
just payoff because they're in a rush

464
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,289
for something

465
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:50,429
but still the covering their tracks and

466
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:53,690
this goes back to our discussion earlier
that's why bring up the risk

467
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,409
it's interesting to me that they were
breaking in and stealing stuff is just

468
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,370
in the hallway

469
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,220
but they were actually breaking into the
apartment when I spoke to the police

470
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,820
about this they sort of Sedalia shrug
their shoulders

471
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,820
you know they didn't do real trust
passages can like walk into the hallway

472
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
which I guess

473
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,330
in prosecution I guess if you actually
breaking the law

474
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,789
there's this whole concept motive means
the opportunity and this whole concept

475
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,620
of how people rationalize the motive

476
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,019
aspect of it I think some people who
work with the system's

477
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:22,490
on a regular basis and I mean criminals
by people were breaking in

478
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,639
might actually see this as not breaking
in

479
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:29,149
at some point they say this thing is so
easy to get into I'm just walking in a

480
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:32,129
public space I'm taking was just be left
around by people

481
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:35,879
almost like the stuff on the street on
the sidewalk Cuse stuff outside on the

482
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:37,230
sidewalk it's been don't

483
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,370
they're looking inside your building in
saying yes is protected by this keypad

484
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,240
system

485
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,210
they must not really wanna keep that

486
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,429
so here's what I downloaded of the web
you know you can hold these for anyone

487
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,269
up

488
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:53,139
and I didn't put the full URL but base
with you on a search for one

489
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,659
but say you're looking at the spectrum
so you'd look for Centex

490
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,909
slash spectrum and then some combination
doc pdf

491
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,360
you will find be install guides which

492
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,320
all the vendors that sell these will
give you and in this case you can see

493
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,490
right there it says post a lock to see
where the circuit board it is

494
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,029
so if you wanna prep yourself you know
you first figure out what the boxes

495
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,580
when you download the circuit diagram
and then you know exactly

496
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,049
popper box goin' touch to post a lock

497
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:24,259
you've entered the building

498
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,549
so moving that fast but

499
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,139
that these were some opportunities
obviously the design the box is the

500
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,070
first shocked me

501
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,129
when it when I saw how easy it was to
break that lip open and just

502
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:38,460
open the box and getting a hot milf
obviously you get a bigger box for this

503
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,039
thing you know

504
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,289
people to be out there selling safe you
know belief that box is safe

505
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:47,029
quality boxes but when I spoke to the
guys that sell these things

506
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:50,499
they actually told me no no that's you
know we see this all the time people

507
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,549
break in these things I guess you guys
have been updated

508
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,860
and when they say updated they don't
mean like we're gonna bring in a new

509
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,690
unit that's been

510
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,220
updated to be more camp resistant or
something it doesn't have push the lock

511
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,450
printed on it or something you know for
enough can be programmed

512
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,999
doesn't have zeros for its defaults they
don't change into that stuff

513
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:09,259
when they say updated they mean they're
gonna bring Israel and real

514
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,610
three big holes and in print putting
these giant permits crews that have a

515
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,620
fancy hat on them

516
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,509
right the security screws designed by GM
now have a pin and the change very few

517
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:18,100
years

518
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,840
so you need a fancy screwed over which
when I thought about it at first I was

519
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,480
like that doesn't make sense cuz

520
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,279
defeats the whole purpose of the
convenience you no longer have a key to

521
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:26,850
open

522
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,580
you know that man is going to be there
for 10 minutes but when you think about

523
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,340
from the attacker perspective

524
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,720
if a minute is too long for them in a
move on that's all we need

525
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,259
right and I know for a fact actually
after this box was

526
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:41,860
fixed equip threes screws in the top on
the very top lip

527
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,399
they literally just drilled a hole in
three spots in the party security screws

528
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:48,480
and the really long like two inches long
you know that metals only

529
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,740
you know 32nd eventually maybe sixteenth
of an inch thick

530
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,769
so they put the screws and and the
building next door got broken into

531
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:00,340
it's pretty funny so I mean there are a
lot of

532
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,899
famous care to people talk about that
how it's bad because it is moving

533
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:05,629
security but we think about it that's
kinda what you have to do

534
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:08,570
right you just raised the bar enough and
they break into something else and

535
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,330
that's

536
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,610
that's right now what I see as the
solution offered by these companies that

537
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,409
know that there's a problem

538
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,279
it's another thing that's opportunity
here's to change the codes and regularly

539
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:18,830
test

540
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,199
and his box is not set up Heather codes
changed regularly so

541
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,960
there's definitely an opportunity for
someone to come over the box that has

542
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,710
some programming language in it that has

543
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:32,330
like expiration for example and requires
you to update the codes

544
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,330
maybe it has the ability to expire
things have been used

545
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,480
in such a long time so no in style an
apartment no one's tiled

546
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,830
in office in 60 days or you know 39
sixty days something

547
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,230
ridiculously high like that will in a
recent right given to those codes

548
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,820
so there's a lot of opportunity in just
how the interface is set up

549
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,168
for how the program is done on these
boxes and the last one

550
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:55,549
I talked about upgrades they don't
really do it that would be another

551
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,309
opportunity

552
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:59,559
you could probably go to people and show
them his exploits

553
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,480
for example you're selling boxes say you
think that really is hard to get into

554
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,929
I mean it's kinda sleazy but the same
time it would be good for the

555
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,330
communities to know about their

556
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,620
I don't think people realize how bad is
our managers and so forth

557
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,799
flip side to that is if you talk to
insurance companies about this they're

558
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,309
the ones we're paying out especially
when apartments are

559
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:21,110
claiming on their managers insurance so
they're going back and say i keeping

560
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,279
broken into

561
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,499
and they could say well what kinda boxed
you have the box isn't up to snuff

562
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:26,470
insurance companies

563
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,559
but some leverage on these guys to say
you're not upgrading improperly not

564
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,809
maintained properly

565
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,230
so i think is a whole economic argument
there as well but I definitely encourage

566
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,499
people to look at their boxes figure how
old they are

567
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:39,600
how many people are moving in and out
will change where the codes changed with

568
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,620
them to be opened up

569
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,669
usually so they have a better sense what
their true risk is

570
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:48,169
how vulnerable it is and then how many
threats that are in the neighborhood

571
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,749
so that I can to the more sophisticated
opportunities this is where I really get

572
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:51,190
excited

573
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,749
side you love the stuff I've done video
surveillance for a while for different

574
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:55,629
reasons and

575
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:58,870
its it's pretty interesting stuff I'm a
big fan of it as a detective control

576
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,440
I'd do not believe its a very good
preventive one and fact I've been asked

577
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,639
to put a fake cameras blinking lights
and stuff like that

578
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,720
to see you'll find somebody else because
I don't believe in the philosophy

579
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,929
I think they can be preventive like the
you people can be deterred

580
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:15,139
but it's like locks can deter people so
you just try to keep you honest people

581
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:15,769
out at that point

582
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,700
at some other good for like you don't
put locks on everything just to scare

583
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,480
people

584
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,320
like you really are trying to prevent
them with a lock and with the camera

585
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,749
you're not really trying to prevent them

586
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:27,269
actually trying to detect stuff and look
at it later so the best way in my

587
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:28,700
opinion to use these

588
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,980
is to put opposing cameras up to be
looking at Wendys boxy get a really

589
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,809
clear view

590
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,950
and never look at the data unless think
it's broken into which of course

591
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,350
requires you know you've been broken
into you to buy something being stolen

592
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,419
or as I talk about later the
temperaments but the bottom line here is

593
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:44,230
that

594
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,960
the cameras I think are real answer
because these things are so weak

595
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,789
I don't think anyone's gonna come out
with really like cheap release a first

596
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:51,320
well

597
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,178
thats not entirely sure I mean with
Arduino and some other stuff you could

598
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,279
probably with the public

599
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,850
system but that being said the cameras
are really

600
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,850
really useful and not just from me
opposing ones are looking at the people

601
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,110
coming in the building

602
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,080
have to do a lot of stuff lately try to
see who's using the box when the dial in

603
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,779
so nice I think you wanna put a camera
in the box see a big the box was

604
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,419
that circuit were so small like you
could put a really nice camera inside

605
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,529
the thing they just records who comes up
and punched

606
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:20,369
simple simple opportunity to have
something that's record every time

607
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:23,960
there's a signal so he's touching it
would record if it's

608
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,119
so where the surveillance another server
freakish idea had

609
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,269
I know for a fact that bluetooth is
being monitored and Max

610
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,049
are being monitored right now so
everywhere you go Bluetooth right people

611
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,168
picking up a signal on track your
whereabouts

612
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:38,529
so I start to think it's unlikely that
attackers are gonna come with any

613
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,720
wifi signal or radio signal but they are
generally bring

614
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,980
those earpieces I don't know why
facilities guys what

615
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,869
you know long black coats nigga your
piece is not mine profiling but

616
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:52,860
we did actually catch on these dudes and
so I did a profile somebody who was

617
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,619
parts operation but anyway if your
profile in Mac addresses and then you

618
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:57,600
have the time stamp

619
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,700
some be getting into the building a log
maybe even when somebody entered the

620
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,360
building

621
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,110
you have pretty good evidence that it
was that person you could tie the Mac

622
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,629
back to them

623
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:08,889
the can be hard to do but our databases
maxine

624
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:11,840
like Italy where they are but exists so
made it so the public service

625
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,789
announcement

626
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,539
if you use Bluetooth they're being
tracked

627
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:20,889
yeah so and the temperance thats I put
the last cuz I really think that's like

628
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:21,909
probably impossible

629
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:24,909
I don't know if he was gonna bother
doing that but would be really cool if

630
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:28,519
the keypad wasn't supposed to be like
giving out the open

631
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,340
sesame commander wasn't was beginning
early reprogramming commands

632
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,269
so since it is a telephone system I
thought to be really call cool that we

633
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:36,039
just value

634
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:40,200
and be like Hello actually a message to
the opening today

635
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,369
to are you sure you want to reprogram
the password

636
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:46,860
just wanna let you know the the
passwords changed today something like

637
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,720
that and that would make it

638
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,720
really really easy for managers you
don't want to be technical because

639
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,570
there's gonna message

640
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,840
would be like hey the box is opened he
the password changed

641
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,529
you know hey there were like 16 I feel
the temps on this one

642
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:02,080
1 you know one number went on

643
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,689
and of course the PBX in that box is
still it's like the size for PCR once we

644
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,519
start messing with it

645
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:09,519
like a small desktop and you could
probably been a nice PDX inside the

646
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,330
thing

647
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:14,350
and you could have it yes and Mail it's
all on regular old wires

648
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,899
so you could use Ethernet you could use
final telephone and you could have a run

649
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:18,840
in a small PDX

650
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,029
idiotic stuff sendmail on to be pretty
awesome

651
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:24,679
so I think there's a ton of
opportunities in these things just are

652
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:25,200
getting me

653
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,879
you're thinking about them because I
realized how simplistic they are and how

654
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:32,700
there's a stick fail security that's
being put on them really doesn't exist

655
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,619
at all like I figured out and again in
early tell you the full

656
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:39,659
story here just give me the parts I
think your public knowledge

657
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,669
but once I figured out that this is
known like

658
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:46,119
when I talk to the security guys I talk
to the police and they're like year

659
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,619
that happens studios like I have been
upgraded with the screws

660
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:52,710
i was thinkin how many people really
knows you know I haven't seen anyone

661
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,940
talking about this

662
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,269
well maybe I'll give it a shot so

663
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:04,269
that's it for my presentation thank you
life

664
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,309
if you have questions

665
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:21,309
see yeah no not the elation

666
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:29,850
well

667
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,799
what are the cool things about a lot of
the higher and boxes and on the batch

668
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,418
systems is that you can you really cool
sophisticated things with them

669
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,659
but my experience has always been
there's a human failure element so I

670
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:52,539
think it's another factor and you talk
about

671
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:56,379
in this so when you get to a level where
you have these people who were involved

672
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,710
i'd authenticating people who are asking
for access is very difficult I find so

673
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,760
feel pizza box right you to deliver
pizza for somebody you don't know but

674
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,010
I'm

675
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,110
us where they live here that sort of
thing works typically

676
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,710
so those are still vulnerable what I try
to focus on here is the easy hacks

677
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,520
like I think if you put this into just a
boxer's little bit better I would have a

678
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,220
presentation

679
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,919
right i'm talking about how easy it is
because these things have been deployed

680
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,659
for at least two decades maybe longer
and they're out there all over the place

681
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:26,399
on people's buildings no one's talking
about them no actually fixing them up

682
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:26,990
creating them

683
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,990
I mean I think screws and even yeah

684
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,850
yeah they're definitely good examples
but unfortunately so many bad ones

685
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,610
that's the real

686
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:49,610
issue he yeah there's a whole other side
to that argument which

687
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,860
II audit data centers all the time and I
wanted to some like military data

688
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,350
centers

689
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,169
and the point at which you get so much
information coming from the system's

690
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,299
that people just block boss over is a
problem as well

691
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:10,550
i've seen. actually to the dissension
same company

692
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,290
for one of them had a door that was
failing and they couldn't fix it and a

693
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,239
little frustration got to the point
where they're just like

694
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,740
yet we get like three four hundred
alarms an hour we just can't do that

695
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,619
because the thing is opened we can turn
off

696
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,540
and so they started ignoring all the
alarms which obviously midfield

697
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,230
because I when the alarm another dornin
see it but the other facility

698
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,639
was like fixing things instantly so you
get outside the technology at some point

699
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,889
you just know how are you managing

700
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:37,450
the feedback carry managing input who's
paying attention you know who's keeping

701
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,259
things clean

702
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,310
it really becomes a practice of managing
things in a secure manner

703
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,799
more than the technology and that's
where at the heart of this presentation

704
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,800
is where managing a lot of our buildings
thinking that we've put some technology

705
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,859
place that is secure

706
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,989
and it's not at all so it's almost our
fault for managing that way

707
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,290
or the managers you on those buildings
people were buying systems and thinking

708
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:56,849
they're gonna be

709
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:00,109
good for twenty years on a really good
for like two and a half years err 20

710
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:00,598
minutes

711
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,460
so on just one sad there's another

712
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,690
social engineering privacy attack vector
I guess

713
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,410
ominous stupidity with the directory
itself on

714
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,279
I lived in an apartment and had to fight
with the manager she didn't understand

715
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,810
why don't want my name

716
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,980
in the directory own no one will be able
you know get to your apartment buzz you

717
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,270
in

718
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,849
well it wasn't a code next my name it
was my actual apartment number

719
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:27,490
so great way to get to know your
neighbours next year

720
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,599
yeah I guess the good thing about
breaking these boxes you could go change

721
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:30,940
that

722
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:37,849
I and also I found this punching in
coats 911

723
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:40,990
automatically buzz you in doesn't matter

724
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,990
and a summer summer the newest first and

725
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,849
you you push a button and it brings
their phone and when they answer the

726
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:49,440
phone

727
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,089
the fan who within the EU falei it's
whoever to push

728
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:57,080
three digits to do you wanna hear it and
then to let you in

729
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,680
now if you can social engineer what
their dialling take yourself on a ferry

730
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,200
who is it or maybe for the finance for
machine

731
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,670
you when you when they figure who was a
different take your cell phone in

732
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,859
and to those numbers would that work
yeah other that works

733
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:14,690
for some systems again the technology
depends but a system that's just in a

734
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,430
state that's listening for the town

735
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,740
and you replicate the tone you enough to
dial your phone you can just have an mp3

736
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,950
file that has the right tone frequencies
right place at the right time if you can

737
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,160
get it to work it would play it

738
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,420
but you have to to play it as

739
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,770
that only has three hearings you
basically have to reach anyone

740
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,259
and when they feel with it you just
enter whatever and right now that's why

741
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,510
I said earlier on that if you just press
the pound key on somebody systems it

742
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,240
gives you that

743
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,849
tone that allows you to push the command
in so right just one key

744
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:46,980
said it depends on the system yessum if
you don't if you don't know the code

745
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,420
then

746
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,290
you can have I found a lot of them I
mean I can't say too much but I think a

747
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:51,839
lot of them

748
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,839
have very simple codes are changed
during the course of your field study

749
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,740
what was the average compromise time for
someone approaching a box to

750
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,070
having entry into the building I did a
very small study

751
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,770
but I mean that was the shocking thing
was this didn't take longer than it

752
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,089
would take you to touch

753
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:16,710
circuit board so the box is open it
swings open freely

754
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,920
so just precariously close so look like
as a close date but in fact you could

755
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,869
just open it and

756
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:26,210
touch and the doors open so less than
five seconds ten seconds I don't know

757
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,670
I guess my point there really is that
for criminal who has a motive

758
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,780
going in some place that's easy to get
into you this is like having a big

759
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,070
button on your door you press opens I
mean it's just wide open to them

760
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,570
at that point so I think it would be
hard to say to that person how dare you

761
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,570
come into this building

762
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,599
when it's so obvious and so easy to them
because they know

763
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,910
it's the people who don't know and think
gosh

764
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:55,910
this is really secure system that were
being fooled and other questions

765
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,730
with the Centex ovation system

766
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,950
of course you push in the cold touring
someone's apartment

767
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,650
but you can program different codes for
the apartment

768
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,960
so someone's getting nor harassing
people busting their apartment he

769
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,560
the number can be reprogrammed and I've
tried

770
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,400
a I gotta do it again the default
passwords for programming in .net: in

771
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,250
guilty pleas

772
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,960
I downloaded the manual for the internet
also for the Ovation

773
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,130
yeah it really depends on who's managing
the box comes down to you

774
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,210
if the persecutor box in and change the
codes your better off

775
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,369
at lunch time a the the the

776
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:37,089
disconnected from the phone system know
that the box in the wall the apartment

777
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:40,799
but when he was working with the phone
system I recorded

778
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,310
the touchstone on my answering machine
hoping it from the outside it would need

779
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,130
a code

780
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,320
or just ring my apartment yes and she
would give the code

781
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,900
that did not work I get to the point
that emphasizes not authorized to be

782
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,619
testing a system so I wouldn't miss it

783
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:58,100
but I still when even I would you test
my own because I don't own it

784
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,680
I mean if I I bought one is things I
tested them different and if Centex

785
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,200
hired me

786
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,410
tested which I'm happy to do by the way
be different but

787
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,520
in this case I was just asked by manager
can I help figure out what was wrong

788
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,240
how people are getting in so I did and I
thought other people should know about

789
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,080
this cuz it seems like public
information already

790
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,330
so I might as well make it more public
just

791
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,170
or just adjust to to defeat me for that
you

792
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,040
you can have entered like I tried on one
system where

793
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,710
with a when he and very entertaining
with the code was painted on my phone

794
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,740
but it did not work

795
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,910
well I'm i think is like any product you
could go to the vendor and say this is

796
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,580
the third

797
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,740
the vulnerability and worried about can
you tell me that this is a boner and if

798
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,460
you tested the validated for they can
explain it to you in a way that you can

799
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,060
see it's the horrible

800
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,320
maybe it was in lebanon

801
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,580
I mean if you look at the feature set on
the if you download

802
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,740
the feature set that comes with all
these things that explains the security

803
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,369
it has

804
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:57,880
so they keep updating that but the
problem is that a lot of work deployed

805
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,040
in their old

806
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,140
and so they have a lot of on abilities
and expressed here actually

807
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,910
in from

808
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,069
I was wondering if you could speak to
how many major manufacturer many vendors

809
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,320
are there really

810
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,680
her how many individual models are
they're deployed across like

811
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,960
video multi have multi dwelling
residential and commercial even in the

812
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,580
US

813
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,890
you know our that's an interesting
question I really got interested enough

814
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,618
for a little while

815
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,670
and then I realized I didn't wanna know
like more than I wanna know

816
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,800
like I think some wish to do a study
honestly I think so much to go out and

817
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,970
do a survey

818
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,290
urban areas figure out how many boxes
there are what person they are

819
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,930
it's the same thing is doing a simple
assessment of an environment to figure

820
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,690
right how many versus an operating
system you have what age they are with a

821
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,780
passion

822
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,830
I didn't do it and you have any sense of
whether

823
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,440
the vendor hey you probably wouldn't
know this but I'm also curious about

824
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,700
whether the vendors

825
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,890
are in the US also tend to feed you know
deploying and selling distributing

826
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,910
worldwide

827
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,040
or whether specific geographic locality
is have different concentrations

828
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,920
or something like that no and look into
that but there's a really good and

829
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,130
that's what I hope to spur

830
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,609
maybe some these are you doing this
haven't seen it but I think University

831
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:05,569
be a prime

832
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:09,060
place for some students to figure this
out to have the time cycles them

833
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,290
antarctica

834
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,950
so we're what happens exactly when
there's like an overloaded the circuit

835
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,550
is the

836
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,780
locked fall to a certain position
because there are a whole bunch of other

837
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,819
former Phillies

838
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:24,560
I did read about someone that actually
had some stuff where

839
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,660
so I know from personal experience other
tests that a lot of stuff that gets

840
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,020
overloaded wall

841
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,460
feel open if you're on the inside but if
you're on the outside it will stay

842
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,849
locked so it depending on which box you
tamper with

843
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,609
as a good place to talk about Telecom's
like the telecoms that was probably the

844
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:40,259
battery backups for the keys

845
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,920
on the doors and so if the battery died
you could not get back into these

846
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,740
offices some some sometimes ex-ceo would
have door they had a breakdown

847
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,390
get back inside because the battery died
that allowed them to fail

848
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,940
rights of it failed barry wasn't there
you can get back inside

849
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,300
your yes but you get outside sure orkut
follow-up

850
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,490
do you know how the circuitry is
actually protected from

851
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:08,050
what's an attack like that if you were
going to well the first occurs to me

852
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,680
when I open this box is a circuit boards
exposed

853
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,310
and combat I did not talk about all the
different numbers are no you wouldn't

854
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,369
you wouldn't break up in the box just a
short nap

855
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:19,270
I mean well as a people do conceivably
there would be some have way too

856
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,569
on some people doing they just open the
box studies

857
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:25,119
but simply couldn't open the box yet
there's another way to get at it because

858
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,020
it has a hole in the back in time you
can get into a lot more detail than I

859
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,609
got into

860
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:31,910
I did a lot more research and stuff but
I'm just showing the easy stuff right

861
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,450
what you get the hard stuff within your
motives probably a lot higher you're

862
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,690
really trying to get the building

863
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,680
i'm talking about people are walking on
the street going a look at Centex you

864
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:38,940
know

865
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,510
I'm gonna walk in here and grab a
painting

866
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,859
to you you filled with no Tronix hirsch

867
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:50,940
never just look at this one box

868
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,790
I was just one system ask you to look at
so I mean I think there are probably

869
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,040
gonna have cysts different issues

870
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,630
and it depends on the age but the fact
is there so exposed

871
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,119
so so he's opened it so easy to look at
the circuit boards expose it so easy to

872
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,420
read

873
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,000
you can read online what you need to do
you can read on the circuit board where

874
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,190
you need to do it

875
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:14,440
it's only very easy it's like elementary
electronics

876
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
okay thank you
