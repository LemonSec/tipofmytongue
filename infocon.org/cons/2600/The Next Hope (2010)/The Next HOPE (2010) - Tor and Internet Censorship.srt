1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,509
brought to our hearts I Jacob I called
about men Sep shown will talk about war

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,120
and Internet censorship

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,610
%ah

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,349
way

5
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,119
thanks everybody iron great to be here

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,810
we're gonna have to keep reading our
next because we don't actually have this

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,400
year so that certainly

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,849
version um so

9
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,349
rejection Sep not necessarily in that
order and I'm sup

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:33,760
a so we're from

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,870
better project and from FF come from the
pics from toward

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,620
and we're going to talk a bit about
Internet censorship in Torrance move

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,099
takes

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,950
exciting world travels so um

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,690
I suppose that if you guys have any
questions and we will take questions

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,718
afterwards we have like about

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,309
one slide per minute allocated so we're
gonna go

18
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,899
I'm reasonably Balfe and thanks quite
Monte

19
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,850
will have the energy to do that everyone
chipping closure

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,439
for this wonderful moment both super
pretty interested in this stuff

21
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,830
I worked on a book with floss manuals
called how to circumvent internet

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,420
censorship

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,520
jake has been a developer of the project
for a while and has also

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,110
traveled around the world and talk
trainings to teach people how to use to

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:21,670
work

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,700
in a wide variety of countries and wide
variety of contexts

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,009
I'm if there are particular things that
you want a seat or do in the future

28
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,530
bike but say you want to advance the way
to DNS person you want to be able to

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,079
make anonymous the industry's

30
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,200
people and request that for a long time
we've been really making rapid

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,960
developments

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,119
we think that an anonymous communication
channel is extremely important in

33
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,009
ensuring what you would use this for and
why you sent

34
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:49,540
guys really helpful to us so that we can
basically make your dreams a reality

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,270
and if for example you don't need any of
this stuff where you think you don't

36
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,100
need anything

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,219
like this you should consider using your
privilege

38
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,170
to help other people and we'll talk
about that a little bit in the stock

39
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,219
arts organizations are very friendly
with one another

40
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,910
and media Feb really appreciate the work
that foo

41
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,319
for people to you we were previously
would have their sources of funding

42
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,680
you'll see from their slides that
they've had quite a lot of interesting

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,790
for some funding

44
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,040
and we were one of those we've also
given them advice and

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,390
whenever returnees was on their board of
directors for time I'm so we're very

46
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,709
proud of two are now that they're an
independent

47
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,550
non-profit organization and that their

48
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,379
so effective is one of the leading
providers have internet privacy

49
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,049
technology

50
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,300
it's really a great thing we've also
been interested in educating people who

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,860
run

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,040
tour notes about legal issues that they
might encounter

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,099
and some of her attorneys are really
interested in %uh

54
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:52,920
they'd be happy to use your about your

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,069
exciting experiences as the turnout
operator a at the moment organizations

56
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,080
are working on a thing called

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,959
HTTPS Everywhere which has some
relevance to you our topic today

58
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,459
because it addresses a the concern that
a lot of people have about were

59
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,900
which is that the exit node operator the
last party in the harp

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,580
if you don't know what that means
article have a little picture and im

61
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,790
few minutes a is in a position to spy on
you

62
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,190
you're trusting them with all through
traffic and if it's on encryption

63
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,200
they have the ability to see it and to
potentially recorded

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,030
I and so also

65
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,190
even if you're not using tor a lot of
your traffic isn't rooted on the

66
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,560
internet that potentially could be
inflicted on the Internet suit ready if

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,230
if you've been working together on this
perfect extension college TPS everywhere

68
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,860
that will make your browser use https on
sites that we know

69
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,269
offer it actually quite a lot of sites
so provides protection to non to users

70
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:50,420
and for users alike

71
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,420
these are some of the sites that are now
supporting HTTPS

72
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,420
just a selected list and I think it's a
great thing

73
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm going in fact I think it's
unreasonable talk about it tomorrow

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,030
so I won't go much further into that
right now but there's been a great run

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,959
because a lot of people think this is
something that's just for credit cards

76
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,959
and it's really not the case credit
cards are not

77
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,459
the most private are the most sensitive
thing for many people that they do or

78
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,510
communicate online

79
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,000
and it's great that so many sites are
recognizing that an offering its UPS

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,490
so we're trying to make it easier for
people to take advantage of those

81
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,120
protections

82
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,720
okay so I remember him today is going to
be internet censorship

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,020
and there's really quite a lot of it I'm

84
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,659
it's something that happens in a lot of
places on a lot of networks

85
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,570
I yeah

86
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,599
there's a connection between censorship
and surveillance that the two are people

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,830
experience all the time

88
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,320
which is better who wants to block your
communications based on their content

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,370
needs to know what the company your
communications is

90
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,759
if they want to stop you from talking
about a certain term

91
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,800
the need to see when you're talking
about that term in when you're not

92
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,150
and so they need to spy on your
communications in order to censor them

93
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,580
arm it's true that if people want to do
much

94
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,840
coarser censorship by preventing you
from communicating with a particular

95
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,080
company

96
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,000
particular network for particular
country because just block that

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,389
but for the really fine print content
based stuff they actually have to

98
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,150
be there on the network looking at what
you do and that produces a very deep

99
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,300
connection between censorship and
surveillance

100
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,750
I'm a new here in a few minutes that
chick has been

101
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,960
going all around the world talking to
people about this stuff

102
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,159
I one of the things that he did in many
of the countries that he visited

103
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,970
was to test some other networks and see
how the censorship works

104
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,039
in terms of doing tricks routes in terms
of doing other things

105
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,099
to look at the technical infrastructure
behind the censorship what kinda

106
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,400
software they use in

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,789
who made it network is it installed in
his it installed in

108
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:54,070
National Fire well kind of thing reasons
for the mutual ISP's

109
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,300
so it's neat actually take a look at
some of those details and see some of

110
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,860
the

111
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,979
trend is disturbing answers

112
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,159
so this is a a great example I mean
these

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,639
DC are everywhere and every every where
I go when traveling

114
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,930
I must travel to some funny places you
think right but

115
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,669
I'm this is in Bahrain I've actually
never been to Bahrain

116
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,198
but I met want their sensors well I was
in Qatar

117
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,509
and when to meet with some people from
Al Jazeera to talk to them about issues

118
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:23,060
that they have

119
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,759
you know one of the main problems that
%uh this year has is that when they're

120
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,479
discovered as a journalist

121
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:33,130
in the country am usually that country
wants to throw them out

122
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,460
right because usually al Jazeera is
reporting something like

123
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,949
regardless of how you feel about what al
Jazeera is doing it's interesting to

124
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:40,590
note that

125
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,710
a lot of these governments don't don't
want al Jazeera

126
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,220
to to be anywhere near their country
they don't want them to report anything

127
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,960
at all they want but total silence in
some cases

128
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,240
and so I met this guy who worked on the
censorship

129
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,250
system from Iran and he pointed me in
this news today you can actually go to

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,400
anonymous dot com dot

131
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,970
I think it's BH I can't really read from
here but I'm

132
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,970
and you can actually see the censorship
site as if you're there and it turns out

133
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,830
that like

134
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,530
you can visit a whole bunch besides this
when you can see in the bottom right

135
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,530
hand corner incest or disabled

136
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,419
so I mean obviously views toward to go
to the censorship you're out

137
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,500
just don't get the you're out but on if
you're in Bahrain you would see this in

138
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,830
enabling terminal are you to you

139
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,210
get around it so in this case is kind of
interesting

140
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,970
I'm and even I think this was mayor
jordan

141
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,979
yeah I think this is an airport in
jordan and iris

142
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:37,229
traveling through giving a talk at the
University injured and and I wanted to

143
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:38,508
use the internet

144
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,090
to connect back to my network and I
wanted to say hey you know

145
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,919
I have this problem I'm in jordan and my
contact hasn't showed up and I'm

146
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,620
stranded at the airport and it's not a
big deal but just to let you know I'm

147
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,270
not gonna check in like I normally get
well

148
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,849
you know interval trouble I'm Sahara I
had actually use tor

149
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,090
to be able to tell my work but I was
okay which is kinda like a hilarious

150
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,819
good thing we work on this project rate
I'm but you can also learn a lot about

151
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,349
this week what is this access denied

152
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,110
what does this tell you I'm a bit here
use it's great for example

153
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,240
because I would like us great access
denied page to you

154
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,440
but you can start to finger print
somebody's but some censorship systems

155
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,530
that are set up around the world are
just

156
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,259
I'm they're not even really best effort
they're sort of like

157
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,300
last-ditch effort so in

158
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,160
in that case this this one's pretty
funny I'm

159
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,340
I don't even I don't remember that when
I one is from either but

160
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,580
I like this please choose from the
following options: disabled children or

161
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,200
modify settings

162
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,669
prayer ok and you can also see in the
bottom right hand corner

163
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,810
the the company that makes this a net
sweeper I believe is what it says

164
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,620
and and see you can actually say like
own at sweeper yet those are those guys

165
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,339
that collaborate with the government in
order to filter

166
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,730
the people that are living behind the
network yeah those guys

167
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,100
those guys are not necessarily because
you want to support

168
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,550
I'm and so there's a there's a lot of
interesting

169
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,880
there's a lot of interesting filtering
like this that takes place and we'll

170
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,029
talk a little bit about

171
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,950
how to circumvent it but there's some
interesting stuff coming out of a

172
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,660
project called

173
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,699
when I which have to tell you about here
in a second

174
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,930
and some other stuff and I'm doing I
think has some merit that goes really

175
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,570
well with our own eyes reports

176
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,050
because I when I has the backing up some
really

177
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,519
brilliant political scientists and they
have some pretty good people that know

178
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,649
how to write software

179
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,029
but they have assertively I guess you
could say they have a different

180
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:29,930
perspective

181
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,750
when I said sorta and though is that
they want to

182
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,300
talk about the filtering at a very high
level so that are useful if you wanna

183
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,540
right tools for getting around
censorship because you say okay

184
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,990
Cuban dissidents have this problem or
you know people in Syria have this issue

185
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,690
are this website is blocked in China

186
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,529
I'm will house a blocked you know why is
it that Cuban descent through this way

187
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:51,790
like how are they targeted

188
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,310
and I N owner when I doesn't really get
into that in great detail in a way that

189
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,540
I would like they don't provide P cap
files that explain to you that

190
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,269
China sense by directional resets like
40 TL's out from where you are

191
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,700
for example like that's information you
really wanna know and I have collected

192
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,310
some of that information and

193
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,200
I'd like to read it a series of tools
with anyone that's interested

194
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,310
specifically for like automatically
detecting collecting the stuff

195
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,410
and make it safe to run from this
country so we can automate all these

196
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,430
tests and we can basically build real
time

197
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,769
filtering detection systems that will
keep people out of trouble

198
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,800
for one and will also allow us to have a
greater technical understanding

199
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,440
the things that are happening yeah FF
actually took a tool which theoretically

200
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,290
could be used for that called
Switzerland

201
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,339
to network neutrality tester and you can
run Switzerland on two different

202
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,500
machines

203
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,850
and have a server and the machines can
try to communicate with each other

204
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,170
and Switzerland will tell you if the
network has tempered with their

205
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,349
communications

206
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,070
because each machine will check in with
this week thru in server and say what it

207
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,620
sent and received

208
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,800
and then the service or two diff them
you can see what the network is done to

209
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,870
your packets

210
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,140
the problem with a lot of these
countries is that using any kind of

211
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,970
proxy at all

212
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,240
immediately makes it through and say the
other tempered with your pics

213
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,519
because you're being redirected to a
proxy

214
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,500
so you just sort of get yes which may
not be exactly what you want to know

215
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,209
on the thing I want to mention at this
point about the open net initiative

216
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,860
be published a couple books which are
very good I'm the first is called access

217
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,450
denied

218
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,959
the second is called access controlled
there about their studies

219
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,940
internet censorship around the world but
if the points that they've really been

220
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,640
stressing

221
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,300
in their most recent book in their most
recent work is that Internet censorship

222
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,209
is not just a technical thing

223
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,700
it's also really has these important
social aspects

224
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,850
including how people feel about
communications and communications

225
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,760
privacy

226
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,240
and how people feel about censorship in
terms of whether they sympathize with

227
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,750
that

228
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,050
in terms of whether they feel safe about
trying to get around it

229
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,370
in terms of whether they self censor
because the perception that there was

230
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,550
being watched

231
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,310
and so they're all the social dimensions
I'm and then there's also

232
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,220
censorship by trying few attack web
sites and intermediaries that facilitate

233
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,130
speech that someone doesn't like

234
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,209
as opposed to trying to block it you can
try to take it offline completely

235
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,750
and to open an initiative has documented
some people trying to attack

236
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,709
web hosts but whose particular magazine
for firms that particular governments

237
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:16,600
don't like

238
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,300
and just trying to take them down
completely and that's a whole other

239
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,829
level

240
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,540
you can't really get around that with
just through a proxy

241
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,639
so unfortunately we don't really have

242
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,750
elaborate answers to those other
dimensions but I just wanted to mention

243
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,250
that there there

244
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,649
because we're going to be talking more
about proxy type circumvention

245
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,519
which is the first thing that comes to
people's mind when they think about are

246
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,899
you going to censor

247
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,790
stuff are you going to get around it
with the proxy but there are these other

248
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,180
layers and they're very important

249
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,779
another

250
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,240
to have to back off and try again after
a number no second care

251
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,740
sense multiple access collision
detection for microphones yep

252
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,180
okay okay remember second to come by
okay so

253
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,200
this is a billboard up the a

254
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,300
funny variety I A used to work at a
small independent film company that

255
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,920
specializes in online rehabilitation
videos using heavy machinery

256
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,589
is very boring job but in general it
afforded me a fantastic

257
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,889
you have an AT&T billboard and one day I
noticed from my office which is the

258
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:24,540
are at the time it was an basically a
military base that have been barred by

259
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,870
the phone company

260
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,730
I'm the Billboard Liberation Front had
hit

261
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,769
the AT&T billboard and they're making a
stand and they were basically saying

262
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,800
what a lot of people were thinking about

263
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,680
which is that at 2nd and Folsom there is
an AT&T building

264
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,750
and that AT&T building has very clearly
been the source

265
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,000
up some illegal wiretapping and mark
Klein

266
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,589
disclose this as a whistleblower and has
shown that the US government is doing

267
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,949
things and at the time was doing things
and we I personally believe that they're

268
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,000
still doing it

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,470
and bed are clearly wiretapping without
a warrant

270
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,820
and I was really happy to see the people

271
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,899
in the local seven to skip the area
where I used to live at the time

272
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,350
weren't happy with that red it's really
easy to think about it as

273
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,990
those countries and those people really
all in this together

274
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,570
and when we do this kinda gripping thing
where we say like these people here are

275
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,779
good and those people there are bad

276
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,260
we're sort of forgetting about the fact
that we are all people together

277
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,490
and we're in this and the Internet is
this idea that were interconnected

278
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,779
and when people start to put up
roadblocks in between what they're

279
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,760
saying is that the individual

280
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,250
doesn't have the same right as people
who are somehow super individuals

281
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,860
right and we should put filters in
between we should think for them and we

282
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,029
should block what they have access to
you

283
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,769
so is very pleased to see this because I
think that we should see more

284
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,550
this right we should see people saying
it's not just about Iran

285
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,040
it's happening everywhere issues like
network neutrality really matter

286
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,160
and people doing filtering and
wiretapping here

287
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,430
is not just a myth this is real right if
you've made a phone call in the united

288
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,810
states in the last ten years the chances
are

289
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,410
that it was recorded by this warrantless
wiretapping program in some way

290
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,100
or the information in the medina about
the college depending on who you are

291
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,199
that's really scary and especially scary
because it's pretty much

292
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,589
obvious that it is legal and courts have
ruled that this is a legal we don't

293
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,730
actually see a lot of change

294
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,060
so we have to build some things that
make this a relevant right the sector

295
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,029
punks talked about getting rid of
trusting the infrastructure

296
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,829
I don't know Declan when was that twenty
years ago

297
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,130
yet eighteen years ago well the sector
punks totally failed

298
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,439
right most adequate and must have been
sold out and start doing other things

299
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,350
but I think that we need to have a new
generation of people that are quitters

300
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,990
sorry to come I don't think your
creditors for the record I'm

301
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,160
but we need to build tools the neck
wiretapping irrelevant

302
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,850
we need to build systems that mean that
when people break policies or laws

303
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,639
but they don't get anything that's
interesting right because what the rule

304
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,670
applies nice

305
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,399
when the leaders have your country do
not follow it dear simply

306
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,759
nothing that you can do except try to
resist in ways that have nothing to do

307
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,730
with these laws right leg instead of
trying to get bush

308
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,519
or a bomb or some other administration
to be held accountable for the crimes

309
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,079
appear clearly committed during the
administration

310
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,279
it is actually important to make those
crimes irrelevant make them so that the

311
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,529
they can commit them all they like and I
get nothing right and i think that part

312
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:15,389
of what war

313
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:19,190
is working on is to make it so that when
other governments do this

314
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,269
it is still useful for people here in
our government I mean I'm an American

315
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:23,959
and I'm disgusted with what's happening
here

316
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,360
this NSA wiretapping thing is absolutely
unbelievable

317
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,620
right and we're all responsible for this
because we all pay taxes

318
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,009
on this so we can't think about as of
and then and we're good and they're bad

319
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,570
because it just isn't that simple

320
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,839
right we we have a responsibility in
this we're doing it won a few

321
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,060
probably works at a facility like this
so it's up to you to tell the world

322
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,070
about crimes are being committed

323
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,660
and help us to design systems that
resist those crimes

324
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,100
right that's how we change the world and
make it a better place we make people

325
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:59,100
who abuse their power irrelevant

326
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,169
I do it but some

327
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,370
productive phone for

328
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,329
so a

329
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,829
just trying to echo that in a way I'm

330
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,129
there is a real role even if you look at
at surveillance outside

331
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,600
love liberal democracies there's a real
role that liberal democracies

332
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,039
governments and technology companies
have played in that

333
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,059
I'm cheaper have a couple more
screenshots

334
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,070
that demonstrate this again and again in
terms of countries in the US buildings

335
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,158
are built infrastructure that's used by
people

336
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:41,600
all around the world I'm

337
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,409
one of the points that i think is
interesting is that if you read

338
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,220
I material about the internet from

339
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,340
say the PRC government

340
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,770
in terms of why did they block stuff
they basically say

341
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,289
well every country book stuff every
country has stuff that they don't like

342
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,059
in the bucket

343
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:06,379
and they started to say that a few years
ago and it's really wasn't true and it

344
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,640
was like what are they talking about

345
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,370
you know they're this blocking thing is
really

346
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,460
new and weird and

347
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,580
the unfortunate thing is that it's
becoming more and more true

348
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,780
but if the government says all countries
boxing's we just block slightly

349
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,750
different things than they do

350
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm over time that's becoming more and
more accurate and less and less over

351
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,780
sorta rationalization so there's that

352
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,440
there's an expert in technologies and
there's

353
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,720
the I'm US firms building things better
used for censorship

354
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,230
I and then often leaving their logos on
have a quick question your work set a

355
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,080
firm

356
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,039
the makes this type is up like we we
were ready to your anything actually

357
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,169
define a survey

358
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:48,770
anybody here working a place to build
filtering technologies

359
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:55,010
no I mean it's okay don't you have a
razor and just say like

360
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,210
yes after neighbor may can make a nice
anybody does anybody work in a place

361
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:58,750
like this

362
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,049
fantastic I have a suggestion for you

363
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:09,320
fuck up your tools right

364
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,168
I wanna see I wanna see software that is
exported to the country

365
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:18,289
it is bugged ordered ready not a bug or
everyone else does everybody notices

366
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:18,980
bugger

367
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,250
a bug Tories a back door the place in a
piece of software by accidentally

368
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,830
making a buck right and if you exploit
the bug

369
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,178
then you have a back door into the
system so I have a demonstration a

370
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,140
thing that looks a lot like a bug or
later and the slides and we'll get to

371
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,539
that but a challenge for you right

372
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,730
if this software gets sent to a country

373
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,590
or to a group of people that are doing
something is wrong release an exploit

374
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,289
and do not provide a patch

375
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:52,289
for that country Intel be patched their
society sir

376
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,140
there's been a lot of discussion here in
the US

377
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,630
I'm like in the US congress

378
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,120
for example about this issue people
exploding stuff

379
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,250
one of the difficulties that I see is
exactly what

380
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,510
trick said just a couple minutes ago
that it's very tempting to try did

381
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,500
say that there's this list is bad
countries that do you

382
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,640
bad stuff and that they're sorta
villains and if we just didn't help

383
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,899
them then everything would be okay I'm

384
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,570
and there are really important
differences obviously

385
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,250
in the kind of political freedom that
people enjoy in different places

386
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,669
I'm very major and very dramatic
differences

387
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,870
I'm at the same time over at the FF

388
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,700
we're always in court with the US
government

389
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,490
challenging the US government's
restrictions on the Internet so it's not

390
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,590
that they don't exist

391
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,350
you know all day long where their
fighting with the US government over its

392
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,649
restrictions on the Internet so

393
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,909
I don't think there's going to be a list
love who the

394
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,380
bad countries are and who the good
countries are in that sense

395
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,850
I'm try to have rankings or something
some human rights groups try to do

396
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,380
but I don't think there's going to be
the villains and the rest

397
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,149
I'm one distinction that is interesting
is that

398
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,830
in some places there are

399
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,980
technical infrastructure specifically to
you

400
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,070
block particular web sites and an idea
that this is

401
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,689
a routine thing to do you and in other
places their use

402
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,330
not yet such infrastructure although
there's potentially

403
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,280
legal infrastructure that could make
that possible in particular

404
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,740
situations I'm

405
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,130
one thing that's come out if this is a
thing called the global network

406
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:44,799
initiative

407
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,799
where Ubuntu industry firms and a bunch
of human rights activist organizations

408
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:56,940
have gone together and created a forum
to talk about

409
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,490
government pressures and how to resist
some of those pressures

410
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,960
by trying to rely on the rule on
transparency

411
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,290
and I think this is a really need
development and the FF is a part of it

412
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,010
and there are a lot of meetings and it's
a good opportunity to work on this

413
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,559
I'm I definitely don't think that this
is the

414
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:18,950
solution or the whole picture or
anything like that but I think it's nice

415
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,270
that there's a forum

416
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,290
for some companies are willing to talk
about these things

417
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,500
and what they're going to do about them
and what their own country

418
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,429
in some cases companies don't want to
talk about things because they're afraid

419
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,070
of

420
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,230
alienating a particular government and
harming their business prospects there

421
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,309
I'm in the particular case if China

422
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:41,408
there's a concern about talking about
things because

423
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,950
china considers a lot of their rules to
be

424
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,000
state secrets and if you talk about what
the government ask you to do you

425
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,950
I'm then they can prosecute you for
divulging state secrets

426
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,330
and that's been a problem for example
for Google which has been trying to

427
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,370
be more transparent about interactions
with government and law enforcement

428
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,520
about request through people's
information and requests

429
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,320
take things down and they've got this
cool site where you can look up how many

430
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,110
requests have different kinds

431
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,250
Kim from different governments over the
course of the year

432
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,070
may have this big question mark on china
and they say well we can't tell you

433
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,879
because they say that the state secret
and we could be prosecuted

434
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,950
and that's actually the only country
apparently where they received requests

435
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,669
for the word

436
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,690
not even allowed to say how many
requests they received

437
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,780
so another piece to the puzzle that's
very obvious to people and something

438
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,620
that you could do you especially if you
like a computer geek

439
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,850
I'm and you have a copy if not count for
something

440
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,860
is that you could have a proxy and you
could get around things

441
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,539
and if other people don't have proxies
you could give them proxies and

442
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:50,020
setup proxies and talking about the
proxy than they could circumvent their

443
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,429
internet censorship by technical means

444
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,730
I this is something that people have
been doing for a long time

445
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,200
and it produces this famous kind of cat
and mouse game where sensors try to

446
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,929
figure out where the proxies are

447
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,870
unblock them or figure out what a proxy
looks like and how you can lock it in on

448
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,620
Midway

449
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,299
I'm there are a lot of trade-offs in
terms of different

450
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,418
features love these proxies there's a
talk

451
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,500
is it n things were twenty things that
you should ask about your sick mention

452
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:18,980
system

453
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,590
20 20 things to ask about your
convention system and the point is that

454
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,010
there are trade-offs

455
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,139
interns are users use and cost and
security

456
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,789
against different kinds and adversaries
and different kinds of threats

457
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:35,919
I'm there at least 20 different factors
that are potential trade-offs

458
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,630
I'm so the most common kind of proxy the
single HAProxy

459
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,299
right where people who are being
censored

460
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:46,080
just go to a proxy that's not being
censored in the same way in the ass the

461
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,320
fuck to do something

462
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,570
and the proxy goes and does it and tell
them the result I'm

463
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,490
there's a lot of potential privacy
concern about that

464
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,220
I'm so that our people are

465
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,630
as the opinion that that's not really
safe enough for a lot of three months

466
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,200
and they've done a lot of work to give
you typically

467
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,230
in the current quarter for configuration
3 hops

468
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,490
where you go through three different
proxies before you come back out into

469
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,130
the public Internet

470
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,230
and it's pretty complex there's a lot of
engineering work that's gone into it

471
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,320
and it certainly like a lot harder than
just setting up a screwed proxy

472
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,439
somewhere in Mentone people about it

473
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,940
or CGI proxy or something it's a a lot
more complexity

474
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,580
I don't mean that it's harder for the
end user necessary to run it

475
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,590
I'm but it might be slower and certainly
required for engineering

476
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,629
different people at the Tower project
between developers

477
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:41,669
through the question why do the trick
people go to all this trouble

478
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,760
to have this design and all this
academic research and so on

479
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,379
I'm so the main point seems to be

480
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:53,690
the privacy threat the threat detection
the credit monitoring

481
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,080
in the best case the single HAProxy is
bankrupted

482
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,250
unit a cover on the threat and Russian
trip

483
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,230
absolutely yeah so I mean there been a
couple cases

484
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,300
there's a guy in the audience right now
whose super badass Iranian activist

485
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,610
and he works if I may be so bold as to

486
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,950
talk about his work is very public about
it and I have a lot of respect for him

487
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,169
as actually consider him to be like a
driving force behind the reason that I

488
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,399
work on this offers people like him but
specifically him

489
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,889
and he works with people that they get
killed

490
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:29,159
right to get arrested made it tends to
death

491
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,340
when the cop some that some fuckin

492
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,780
serious shit right there right so its
it's not dicking around time

493
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,800
basically when that happens you have to
make bold claims and the willing to

494
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,809
stand for them and you still have to
tell people that it's risky

495
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,129
suggest jumping from your computer to
another computer is not

496
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:51,270
it's not going to cut it right there's
all sorts of things that can happen

497
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,399
you you will be in a situation in which
the

498
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:57,619
say Iranian government and it's not just
the iranians but don't have access to

499
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,740
the logs on that server

500
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,559
not be able to do correlations and
timing attacks they may in fact

501
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,750
run the proxies which is why the proxies
may in fact still function

502
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,850
they may not have crypto they might be
spoofing something

503
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,149
the use of sign certificates they might
be doing a man in the middle attack

504
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:15,629
they might be doing something else you
could be doing BGP

505
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:19,619
prefix hijacking right you need strong
crypto and you need distributed

506
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:23,190
distribute identity in the distributed
trust and and most people think we'll

507
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,919
let you know that's not me

508
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,129
but it isn't you today but everything
that you do on the internet bill to

509
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:32,110
profile the tells a story about you
tomorrow

510
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,090
and so it's absolutely necessary to not
use a single hop rock the

511
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,139
and when I say one hop actually think
that it's important to distinguish

512
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,129
between just one physical harm and one
entity

513
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:47,260
so yes it's true that 1/2 proxy might be
faster in some cases but you have to ask

514
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,320
yourself especially in my friends case
you know how fast do you want to die:

515
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,220
on I would think the answer is not very
fast I'm working on dying quite slowly

516
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,480
thank you

517
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,260
met it comes down to another fact which
is that

518
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,119
if you have a whole bunch of proxies and
they're all one by one company

519
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,610
whether they're the shadiest company
you've ever heard a or the most secure

520
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,309
awesome company you've ever heard of
their still one company

521
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:14,379
which means that they still have all the
organizational blunders have a company

522
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:18,119
there's no what we call privacy by
design and this is a really important

523
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,409
distinction when you evaluate something
like this like using a VPN provider

524
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:24,340
totally fantastic until they decide to
burn you

525
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,770
right want other own and how many people
here have ever seen computer systems

526
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,360
that are owned and no one knew they were
around

527
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,720
anyone rate so that's probably your VPN
provider

528
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,799
and it doesn't matter if it's your job
or whatever

529
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,270
if it's your job it's to him certainly
Andre like I mean how

530
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,580
I mean well so it's about ideas for what
we want to do

531
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,040
because we want to build something
that's a little bit stronger see if I

532
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,600
can stand up here in with my arms like a
monkey

533
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,639
okay so we have Alice and Alice's

534
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:55,909
a but say someone that's just wanting to
get onto the internet she wants to be

535
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,629
able to read Facebook or Twitter she
wants to be able to post a

536
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:02,760
picture of a cop shooting nada in the
heart or

537
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,100
you know basically wants to do something
didn't she might have to fear

538
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,659
retribution from the state

539
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,609
or from other actors so Alice needs to
connect to the first relay

540
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:14,960
she has a list ivory lace and we can
talk about that in a second but

541
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,080
she she has these little colored streams
and the ideas that she has a

542
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,049
at-large connection this looks like
Apache and Firefox talking to each other

543
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:25,070
so it's a little bit of networks taken a
nap

544
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,480
a stake in a graph you Jesus Christ that
government is fantastic

545
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,760
so visit a less connection between the
two of them we like

546
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,580
we like to think that it's not released
a go and and the reason is because

547
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,189
stay goes out pretty late strange thing
and people like to pretend that they

548
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,200
fixed it or it's perfected but

549
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,679
staggers basically only one but if
security you're like i you're hiding

550
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,790
and your hidden or not and I think that
it's Michael dangers to make the claim

551
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,309
if they go and so people to do that you
should be pretty

552
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:55,460
you should worry about what they're
saying then it is really one knows

553
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,940
about Alice knows that alice is an
Canada or honor wherever

554
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,570
right and she knows this herself
obviously so what she does and she

555
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,070
billed what's called a circuit

556
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,090
should build the circuit really one she
extended to relay to you

557
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:12,919
really to now knows about one and really
too will soon learn about really three

558
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:16,369
and really three knows where else is
going else wants to talk to Bob

559
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:20,030
and really three has no idea where else
is anymore

560
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,470
each different relay is run by either a
different person or a different

561
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,320
organization

562
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,580
this is an example privacy by design
right social 400 people run into the run

563
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,470
to our servers

564
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,850
and unless they or collaborate together
you're not using one organization

565
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,659
each person has a subset of the
information required to screw you over

566
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:40,309
and they won't do it because the reason
they run it is because they need it

567
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:41,070
themselves

568
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,109
and because they want to help you there
are cases where this could happen

569
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,030
where someone could run all of them
together but I think that it is

570
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,770
extremely unlikely that you will run
into those cases

571
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,200
am we'd love to hear about cases were
you think that that is happening so that

572
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,369
we can improve the software

573
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:02,070
for example if you wanna create a
circuit our circuit selection algorithm

574
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,918
is all free software um and so you can
see how we select this article we have a

575
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,940
set of constraints you have to satisfy
so if you want to build

576
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,240
a connection to the first top it has to
have liquor Guard flag for example and

577
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,600
if you want to exit from the network

578
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,340
network server has to have an exam
policy allowing it none of the servers

579
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,030
in your or

580
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,639
circuit are allowed to be in the same
slashed sixty network block

581
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:24,750
and there are other things like people
that wanna run 52 or servers

582
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,280
I run about 15 to our servers in any
given point I'm in most of them

583
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,639
are tied together what's called the
family so that you when you choose one

584
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,540
of my service you don't choose fourteen
other

585
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,820
my servers and in later and later cases
when you build circuits

586
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,200
by which I could reduce up the screen
but um this is a

587
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,950
this is pretty much exactly what I'm
talking about with Iran missus super

588
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,659
scary because this is the future a lot
of places

589
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,649
if people choose to take in this
direction when you have an authoritarian

590
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:50,530
regime

591
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,590
which is every government in power
except maybe in Christiania

592
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,480
in Denmark am for those of you that have
been there you understand and for those

593
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,340
of you that have a nice to just a visit
to Copenhagen

594
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,119
I am essentially it says these people
should know where they are sending me

595
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,740
SMS and email as the systems are under
control

596
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,520
they should not think using proxies will
prove prevent the identification to this

597
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,059
is key

598
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,500
right they want to identify you so they
can hunt you down and

599
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,359
arrest you and your family and maybe
tell you right and it's even worse if

600
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,679
they're trying to read US website or use
US service potentially because then they

601
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,040
look like spies

602
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,330
and the probably not people are just
trying to get the outside perspective on

603
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,480
what's happening

604
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,679
during media blackout in their
particular part of the city

605
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,740
right to this is super dangerous they
say is

606
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,549
if they continue those who organizer
issue appeals about opposition protests

607
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,639
have committed a crime worse than those
who take to the streets

608
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,899
artist like to think about that right
that's crazy that is

609
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:49,490
the cut the national police chief in
Iran saying that

610
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,700
susan is a consensus here and so is why
privacy by design is sold very important

611
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,830
is basically this situation for a lot of
people

612
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,250
is back actually the entire I mean Iran
is I think pretty

613
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,369
good example but it is not the only
example by any means

614
00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:06,809
right the United States is clearly
different than that you know and I think

615
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:09,168
it is important to not say that they are
the same

616
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:14,179
but it is also the case that its with
the NSA wiretapping that we have one

617
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:16,119
might ask oneself

618
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,899
what do they do with the love that data
and what will they do with that data

619
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:19,470
later

620
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,700
when you do something what happens when
they decide you're affiliated with a

621
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,040
group or you've done a thing

622
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,149
and that information is somehow used
against you what will you do then

623
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:31,169
right and the answer is you probably be
in a lot of trouble and there will be

624
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:34,460
much for you to do because they will
build the dossier on you that

625
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,950
the you know had basically that the East
German government would have killed four

626
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,639
right but they don't even need to have
that kind of oppressive regime because

627
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,169
they have a passive

628
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:47,869
aggressive regime if you will there
there is a green line

629
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:51,119
I'm I wish I had it here and friend of
the court brief

630
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,830
that AT&T filed in the Olmsted case

631
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,919
many decades ago about the legality of
wiretapping

632
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,419
from and I'm

633
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:07,570
I think they said this telephone system

634
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,489
I'm whose great he basically said that
the telephone system was much more

635
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,149
privacy invasive

636
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:16,388
then what to British did

637
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,210
to the colonists before the
revolutionary work

638
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,359
with the Ruutu assistance in general
warrants

639
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,699
that we should look that up it was great
it was AT&T in the on status

640
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,000
we should %uh power through some are the
slides to do that only with another half

641
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,859
an hour and I want to take some
questions

642
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:38,100
so real quick tour it's free software
freely free supper is super important in

643
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,299
this case because we don't want you to
trust us we want you to be able to audit

644
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:42,250
the source code

645
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,350
you want you to be able to do anything
you want with it to BSD license you can

646
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,668
repackage it do whatever you want with
it

647
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:52,009
it's fantastic you should use it I'm we
have a specification

648
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,480
which is similar to an ARF sees Tyler 90
s style type thing both

649
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,980
avoiding all the committees and meetings
involved with those trappings

650
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,540
I'm we also as a result love having the
specifications have a bunch of different

651
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,910
independent client

652
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,520
implementations and we would like more
right we want as many people as possible

653
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,540
to write or

654
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,569
related software because we think that
it will not only help us find bugs in

655
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,200
our specification but also in our
implementation

656
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,069
and doctor automatic your phone is
unfair

657
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:23,620
I'm has started for you I'm

658
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,520
in any case I'm we have approximately
2,000 active relays

659
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,990
about one-third love those our exit
relays

660
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,589
and so what that means is that one-third
of them allow you to connect

661
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:37,150
outside a bit or an hour to the general
internet and there are some restrictions

662
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,190
on a

663
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,230
I am and we have about a quarter of a
million users at any given point in time

664
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,060
count this we have to do some
statistical and wanna say magic but

665
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,130
Carsten

666
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,410
are losing their nice German who does
are counting I'm fee

667
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,279
has a little bit of trouble and counting
this because we don't have logins and

668
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,460
passwords we don't have any of this crap
that would

669
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,259
allow us to violate a policy right so we
have to make best guess is that this

670
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,319
so we have a best guess about a quarter
of a million users

671
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:08,060
that are returning on a daily basis and
this is based entirely on volunteer

672
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,120
efforts right

673
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,630
but or pressure itself just writes the
software and promotes

674
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:16,790
the use it everybody here in this room
if everybody runs it or server

675
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,710
we double the size of the Tor network
tomorrow right that's how this works

676
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,710
and that's why we have two thousand
realize so you should really consider

677
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,819
using a privilege to help other people
if you have a computer and

678
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:30,259
network especially considering the fact
that you can control whether or not

679
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,640
you're an exit which means you get to
control

680
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,200
basically how much you risk which is to
say you get to choose your own level of

681
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,560
involvement

682
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,440
right the network is approximately
greater than three to give it a second

683
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,000
and where a 501 c3 non-profit so if you
want to give us money we're happy to

684
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,870
take it and you get a tax write-off

685
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm which is pretty fantastic we believe
that you can save the world by making a

686
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,230
profit

687
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,299
and we don't really think we're saving
the world but we're trying to build a

688
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,140
viable alternative

689
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,560
for the way that things are going now
which is super important right

690
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,160
if you want to see change you have to be
to trouble you want to see in the world

691
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,049
so from her we got some are right

692
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:14,060
we have a bunch of under developers I
work full-time on to work there's a

693
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,910
whole bunch of other people to work
full-time and its people

694
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,509
dedicate their lives to this because we
believe that we have to build this

695
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:20,549
alternative

696
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:23,200
and we're the only group that I know
that has been funded by both the

697
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,240
Department of Defense

698
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,470
and the Electronic Frontier Foundation

699
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,970
and I want to save you know there's a
lot of corporate bashing

700
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,359
Google despite the fact that they could
probably over through every single

701
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,430
government in the world tomorrow

702
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,109
hasn't done that to my dismay but

703
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:47,130
they do for fund us from time to time
because the really actually do put their

704
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,339
money where their mouth is when it comes
to privacy

705
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:52,720
like that sounds like they don't there
with you be me this phone

706
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,009
this Nexus One phone feel free to try to
run it remotely and the thing is that

707
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:00,529
did that so that we could part order and
read because the really actually do want

708
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,470
to support viable alternative for people
they know that they can get ad revenue

709
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,910
for manana by streams for the new some
people need access to information and

710
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,379
that is really important

711
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,500
and have super super smart people hike
Adam

712
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,520
Imperial violet who works on tore
occasionally or SSL related things

713
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,359
working on privacy enhancing
technologies because the really believe

714
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,450
that access to information

715
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,790
and really being able to produce and
consume information is essentially a

716
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,390
fundamental human right as outlined in
the United Nations Declaration

717
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,680
and and well some people might not agree
with that

718
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,649
and I obviously don't be for Google I
think it's quite clear that we should

719
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,490
move in that direction as if that is
true

720
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,690
because I think it is true and I think
it's a reasonable thing to do. so

721
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,920
real quick crash course in TOR I'm

722
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,460
is not TCP over TCP so just in case you
were wondering

723
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,779
we transport streams and its forty CB
connections but the way that works

724
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:55,450
generally is that you have a SOCKS proxy
locally

725
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,900
you make a connection to it it does the
circuit I mentioned previously

726
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,549
you attach a stream to a given circuit
you leave the Tor network

727
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,120
the TCP connection is actually created
at the edge of the Tor network rate

728
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,540
so it's pretty straightforward it has
limited the industry support although

729
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,180
lately Colin Milner and I've been
working on this we built a small

730
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,080
Rd nationally regionally wrote about
like three years ago in a bandana and I

731
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,589
spent last month and a half working on
its called TTD in SD

732
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:24,060
and thats TCP tore DNS Damon

733
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,680
and the idea is that you can make any
arbitrary query type you'd like

734
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,450
i'm for DNS locally and it'll make a TCP
connection say to like

735
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,540
deduct the dodi eat and

736
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,580
it'll do recur security number eight
lucky number eight

737
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,940
probably not chosen on accident and and
you can use any recurs in server you'd

738
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,279
like

739
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,410
and the idea is that you can do anything
she can have a fully transparent liter

740
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,080
bike network you can make requests for
service occurred MX records et cetera

741
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,109
and you get all the normal protections
you get otherwise it also allows you to

742
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:54,339
duty in a sec I believe if you need

743
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:58,109
I might need a different workers have
been over for that I'm we also support

744
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:01,690
be suggest that there's a people that I
just read about this

745
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,779
just basically state of torture and DNS
Union

746
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:08,420
I am and it's worth reading if you care
about anonymized NS because the US is a

747
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,990
great way to deion on my someone
actually

748
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,210
I am basically everybody to run the tory
lane this room when they go home tonight

749
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,440
we'll publish their server descriptors

750
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
that means your IP address your public
key information a couple other bits of

751
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,870
information may be an email address

752
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,690
are you publish a distant record 30s
there are currently a directory thirties

753
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,890
run the world there's one in Sweden
there's a cup on the United States

754
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,759
Austria Germany et cetera and they run
by different people that really believe

755
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,500
in this and not to put their name on it

756
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,580
and well a centralized authority has
some problems

757
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,240
we currently don't believe that we're
running into any of them and maybe that

758
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,980
doesn't work

759
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,130
well in the long run it works really
well right now for not only stemming

760
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,120
abuse but also monitoring the network
understanding network and growing it

761
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,509
so a client basically bootstraps this by
going to a directory 30 or to any to our

762
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:57,589
server and download a list of all the
possible

763
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:01,049
surgery less we call them orders

764
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:05,250
you know as in an Onion Router and and
basically clients choose their path in

765
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,190
the network and this is super important
because it's essentially a private

766
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,069
information retrieval system at its most
basic point

767
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,960
which is that you want to choose a hot
through the network that no one else

768
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,670
knows

769
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,470
or a path through the network but using
ops in that selection

770
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,710
and you do that and when you have done
that

771
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,130
you exit the network and it's super
important that no one else knows

772
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,549
what you chose or they can be anonymized
you and make you communications

773
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:33,310
you have to download the whole list the
sucks if you're on a 9600 baud cellular

774
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,870
telephone in Zimbabwe

775
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:39,160
works pretty good lot other places on
nice thing is you don't have to download

776
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,500
it

777
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,390
your mister descriptors every single
time you want to use that you downloaded

778
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,650
it's good for a while

779
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,970
and the networks days pretty fresh I'm

780
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,600
as I said previously internal organs
there are no passwords are you install

781
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:50,900
it

782
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,549
and yet sometimes can be kinda slow I
regularly download things at

783
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:58,130
250 kilobytes per second over tore them
so your mileage may vary

784
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,670
and your throughput mayberry

785
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,569
and miss kaptur the there's a lot more
to this protocol

786
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:09,339
writer surest there is a lot more to the
vertical but the most important thing to

787
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:10,060
remember is that

788
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,890
you are as secure using tor as you are
using the Internet anywhere

789
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,420
sometimes more secure there's been some
controversy about this

790
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,540
that you can sniff in exit node for
example book

791
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,029
news flash the Internet is not secure

792
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:30,190
okay so moving along here if you store
it's possible that you'll be more secure

793
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,430
because the people targeting you are
probably local to you

794
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,350
is almost certainly that that is the
case especially in the case that Iran

795
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,960
especially in the case of other
repressive regimes like the United

796
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,930
States or Canada or Germany or

797
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,730
United Kingdom which alter predictably
Center in some way or another depending

798
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,220
on where you are

799
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,100
um so anonymity is important but it's
pretty difficult to talk about anonymity

800
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,680
with my grandmother

801
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,230
aside from the fact that she's blind and
cannot use a computer and she does not

802
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,279
actually know that word

803
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:59,609
really means in a technical sense so
instead I tell her privacy

804
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:02,779
like curtains or pants

805
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,700
prime everybody understands that who
here has nothing to hide I challenge you

806
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,420
to streak

807
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,480
right okay

808
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,010
businesses don't care a privacy they
usually want to do something

809
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,280
a.m. you know securely that's what they
care about because that's what sells

810
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,940
widgets and who doesn't and so forth I'm
governments generally

811
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,470
and it says there they care about
traffic announces resistance because I

812
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,420
got privacy

813
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,980
got security if there was a really big
guy everything else you could want but

814
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,310
they don't have traffic analysis
resistance

815
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,040
which is another fancy we're talking
about anonymity and of course

816
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,700
what we're really talking about mostly
today is this idea a block users

817
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,240
and they're like oh my god I can get my
facebook and it's known secret review

818
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,690
and tell you think about things like
what mike Mullen spike has said

819
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,120
where you have the network effect with
things like Facebook where when you're

820
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,500
no longer able to reach it you no longer
have a network

821
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,000
you no longer have the ability to
communicate you don't get invited to

822
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,630
parties

823
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:00,920
whatever I mean I don't really go to
those parties but if you do it and you

824
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,550
care about that

825
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,270
and a lot of people do care about that
especially because it's hosted outside

826
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,830
of their country and a lot of cases and
that is very powerful

827
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,540
Iceland for example has a ridiculous
penetration rate when it comes to face

828
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,529
but I think like almost

829
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,930
everybody in Iceland is on Facebook on
and that means that it's really

830
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,270
important to be able to reach and if
someone were blocking it

831
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,400
I mean obviously it's not tenable
everybody in the entire country

832
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,030
has to happen firewall but it's nice to
build an alternative that allows you to

833
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,950
do that if you need it

834
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,200
and hopefully you use it for something
more radical than Facebook but

835
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,540
coming on to this one share

836
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,570
for her pretty late their I think I
double

837
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,670
but did so district lot of legitimate
people you store

838
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,090
that's pretty much you know a lot of
people will say like you know it's

839
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,280
because the view that

840
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,180
bad people are allowed to do things in
the world and my response is you

841
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,470
might be that bad person and I still
think we should run this network despite

842
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,240
you pretty much because there are a lot
of people out there that don't have the

843
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,910
privilege that a lot of us have been
there a lot of people out there

844
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,690
that needed and can even speak up and
say that they needed for the reasons

845
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,470
that they needed

846
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,630
and get a there are a lot of sick people

847
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,400
and in the real world prime

848
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,450
the thing is that we're all in this
together so we have a choice

849
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,970
we can decide that we can live in a
network police state because i've a

850
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,110
couple bad actors

851
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,280
or we can decide that we would like
freedom and liberty

852
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,050
on the Internet as we have in real life
because we balance these things

853
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,790
reasonably

854
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:29,790
and some people don't agree with that
and fuck those people and I'll tell you

855
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,730
I'll tell you one more thing I mean not
to be too careful about it but the FBI's

856
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,930
innocent images division uses toward a
fine child pornographers

857
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:41,370
so when the police used to work to find
the sick people

858
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:44,380
you have to remember that content
doesn't include intent

859
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,800
right if someone is uploading those
images are downloading those images to

860
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,100
you

861
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,300
build a sting operation or to arrest
people who were you

862
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,390
to tell me but I am doing the wrong
thing because I think that actually

863
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,930
pretending that these things don't exist
actually doesn't make them go away

864
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,940
right ostriches head in the sand doesn't
change the world one bit

865
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,630
sorry so I'm

866
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,980
trying to skip it because we haven't
even mentioned produce right so

867
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,880
essentially got the servers else wants
to reach them because the directory

868
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,170
has all the IP addresses you got a
firewall the viral loads up those two

869
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,920
thousand IP addresses boots block

870
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,190
okay but the problem so you see this in
China Iran Levitan

871
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,450
lebanon Levitan Wow Lebanon Qatar

872
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,590
right every day you see stuff like this
it is usually the case

873
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:34,000
bat these web sites are blocked right
and these web sites being blocked that's

874
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,400
that sucks we have a solution for that
though but we do is

875
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,070
we do it wears people used to do back in
a day

876
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,260
we deliver to review email to send us an
email and we'll give you some binary

877
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,430
since in signatures so all you have to
be able to do is find our GPG key

878
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,470
information and you can verify that you
got it

879
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,510
and it just so happens that because
people haven't solved a spam problem

880
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:59,630
they also haven't solved this problem so
now you get that and you get around in

881
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:03,320
and this offer for delivering this
pretty useful here's an example

882
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,810
this is a slightly older graph in April
we had about 400 people a day at a peak

883
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:12,060
I'm downloading toward your email I was
in China in hong kong during a training

884
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,009
with some people

885
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,130
I'm from mainland China and one day we
had like

886
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,270
I think tenor something thousand people
to doesn't people

887
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,440
or so not use this because they heard
that the Chinese government was about

888
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,270
the block Gmail

889
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,759
and so they're like oh my god I gotta
get myself a copy of torrents someone

890
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,910
Twitter Dorothy internal China version
of Twitter a

891
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,859
you know use this email address and all
the sudden we decide on the requests

892
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:36,950
and that means that their defense should
system was not even remotely set up to

893
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,150
deal with that type a filtering

894
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:41,730
and sometimes mail servers used RTLS
which means that they got dynamic

895
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:42,420
encryption

896
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,800
I mean I got opportunistic crypto and I
was pretty helpful so they got it they

897
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,550
were able to verify the signature
because

898
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,380
social networks allow people to post the
red signatures and the keys for

899
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,520
verification

900
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,950
people got it and so it is pretty rare
though

901
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,120
um the actual network is blocked but
China and two were sorted in this

902
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,960
cat-and-mouse game which is stupid and
we don't really wanna play it but we're

903
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,150
doing anyway

904
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,330
am which is that the download list the
descriptors

905
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,029
and they block the website so the
firewall if you happen to run it for

906
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,220
server you can visit by do for example
because your IP addresses and the

907
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,910
filtrate if you try to go to bite you

908
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:19,490
then boom you get rid of you get by
directional TCP resets for example

909
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:23,250
that's a big problem and happens all
over the place on in China

910
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,280
it also happens in some other places
like on small corporate networks because

911
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,780
they download this list

912
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,980
and we also actually provide an API for
downloading a list of all these things

913
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,780
for people like the Wikipedia that want
to be able to treat or users differently

914
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,130
but in general on a black people were
exiting from tor right

915
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,750
rather than people who are entering into
two or certain in general the idea here

916
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,440
is that we want to get around that right
so we want to build a viable alternative

917
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,080
and it's called the bridge and a bridge
is essentially

918
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,299
a way to use mutual aid in solidarity as
principles for working around this type

919
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,910
of network fascism

920
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,930
and the ideas you send an email to
Bridget or project at work

921
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:03,160
or you are a friend on one of our
Twitter accounts

922
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,339
or something like this: and we give you
some information so we take the problem

923
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,100
which is

924
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,670
on how do we keep 2000 release other
hand the Chinese government

925
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,730
or any other any other government and

926
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,940
them that we give basically access to
this network right how do we do that

927
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,600
well we can't that's an impossible
problems instead what we do is we

928
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,300
segment

929
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,090
these things that are called bridges and
we give them out selectively to

930
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,230
different buckets

931
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,580
so someone from one gmail address always
gets the same set of bridges so you have

932
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,840
to basically

933
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,700
rate Google's captured system in order
to be able to get all the bridges

934
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,220
or you have to visit bridges that her
brother got word from

935
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,109
every every different geographic
location in the world to get all the

936
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:45,049
bridges and then we still have a reserve
that we hand out a social network so

937
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,750
that important key players in places
that have told us that working for

938
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,880
social change

939
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,430
those people still have access because
they're not doing actual

940
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,190
network fingerprinting in this case the
usually just doing IP and port address

941
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:57,350
combinations

942
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,670
and so here's a great example a graphing
network fascism

943
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:04,760
game so this is China just before the
60th anniversary in some do taken over

944
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,750
the country

945
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,100
and it goes like this: 10,000 users
reconnecting ever

946
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,970
ever a box in abscam that graciously
donated by the founder for access for

947
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,380
all drop concrete

948
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,790
and he's a fantastic I'm be given this
box it pushes somewhere between 100 and

949
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,970
300 megabits it or traffic today

950
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,109
one day we noticed that we had about
10,000 users from China

951
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:27,690
and then we noticed around that
anniversary we had zero

952
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,760
right be effectively blocked people
connecting to the box

953
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,970
here's the next day this is people using
bridges

954
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:38,390
bed apt instantly red separate is really
are a viable alternative

955
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,509
when people are blocked

956
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,080
so to expand as we said around the world
I think we probably have to rush through

957
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,590
this a bit because it

958
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:51,160
even counting questions we have like
five minutes

959
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,310
maybe you can say like four seconds
about each side

960
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:58,210
sounds good but Cup okay three metres
countries and he tested their networks

961
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,730
and saw some other censorship

962
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:04,120
who is often done with the help a
computer in the US

963
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,450
China every corner so block

964
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,770
download lists and they come after tore

965
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,900
just so happens that they also take that
list directly from us so maybe

966
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,200
it's a good idea to you for example
start putting in website state grant

967
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,680
visas to people for in China

968
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,580
maybe pen that will disrupt the network
communication now know if

969
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,759
here's an example love a another swig
rocking

970
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,690
on this is lebanon here Okanagan users

971
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,730
miss him so Aguero they Brunswick
artiste

972
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,740
2.5 stable 11 does the IP addresses the
slides will be online later feel free to

973
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,450
take a look at both

974
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:43,800
I'm Aguero does some pretty nasty Sep I
was in beirut I was actually

975
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,530
detained and forcibly the rejected from
lebanon

976
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:51,550
I'm when I was there so I was deported
they did not appreciate me

977
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,820
I M it was a little bit frustrating
actually because I don't think that I

978
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,310
was doing anything wrong at all and I
think was mostly because my last name

979
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:02,270
I don't think they knew that I was gay
but sorry ladies and the thing is that

980
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,720
but not too sorry but I'm

981
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,040
you know and they were not tonight but
you can see here they don't they don't

982
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,050
begin a sweeping that heredity address

983
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:15,030
there's no DNS secular involved though
so you don't know that that's the ready

984
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,600
pls you already know in which case you
don't ask but

985
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,300
I'm you can see here for example but for
hops to austria

986
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,320
you can tell the tampering with the
network by just doing a basic country

987
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:24,650
throughout

988
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,430
right and this is this is pretty simple
this is TCB Treasure Island for 80

989
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:32,040
you can see for ops eighty six lows
against that is a box that is probably

990
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,839
four hops away from me and it's really
overloaded

991
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:38,810
I'm you can also see this here when you
use port 443 than it actually does go

992
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,770
out of their country and it does
bypasses their children tireless

993
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:45,330
so what does this hijacking the cash and
the other was not

994
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,520
I'm it's pretty incredible how much

995
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,509
hijacking is actually taking place
though because basically that means

996
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:55,080
everybody's traffic is being inspected
by these all done perhaps with boxes

997
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,630
but think about how bad that it hurts
really bad I'm

998
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:02,339
you can also see the same thing worst
ISP never for the middle east by the way

999
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:05,339
I mean I understand what they're trying
to get out right like they're trying to

1000
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:06,450
say Turner

1001
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,890
but the thing is that the really a bad
name in English

1002
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:14,120
I mean it's not doing anything for a
like in our country relations I'm sure

1003
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,130
we've got another cyber attack from tera
net

1004
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,910
I'm same thing to ups not the case

1005
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,960
his cut our big you can see here in the
top a bunch of information

1006
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,680
about backshell proxying on you can take
a look at that URL you'll notice that

1007
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,250
there's filtering information

1008
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,580
nd i Peter said the user and the flags
that they have which means you can just

1009
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,790
bring people you can say are you know
the kind the hotel next me

1010
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:41,570
yeah he was going to some website you
should have been maybe a large

1011
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:45,050
generates an event maybe the event is
the police couldn't on someone's door

1012
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:49,010
had some pretty weird shit happens me
when I was in Qatar and I

1013
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:52,390
you know I don't wanna mess with that
back government certainly not one there

1014
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:56,069
and I think that that's kind of a little
bit interesting that this is like the

1015
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,710
level of sophistication

1016
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,390
I'm so those are the IP addresses and
names for the proxies in Qatar

1017
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:05,160
then you can take a look at those boxes
as well okay I'm quickly moving on to

1018
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,629
Iran

1019
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:08,970
we have like maybe thirty seconds yeah
okay

1020
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,370
so Iran basically has a lot of problems

1021
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,190
and basically have some dials for
turning the network up and down they

1022
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,380
don't usually do as much

1023
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,790
up the blocking and other places term

1024
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,920
Nokia Siemens essentially says that the
reason

1025
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,780
that they're doing this is because the
West has forced them to build lawful

1026
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,560
interception

1027
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,470
so ask yourself when you think you need
wiretapping about the trickle-down

1028
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,970
effect that your actions have

1029
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:34,690
on other countries because there is one
I'm

1030
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:38,030
ironically this is one does but doors I
was talking about get is censored

1031
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:41,910
for certain requests but G space the
space key space

1032
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:46,299
is a bug and get it passed their filter
so if you make a GET request

1033
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,470
you filtered and if you don't make this
other one then you get past unless its

1034
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,710
Facebook which is hard coded and block

1035
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:54,990
I'm so I think that it's

1036
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:58,770
important to say that it's effective but
I think that it's mostly socially

1037
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,759
affected which is the scary part

1038
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,640
and Burma is an example of country ours
we had way too many flights remain

1039
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,970
but is mostly for later so I'm for the
net was caught selling

1040
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:14,520
and they tried to deny it well here you
see you one other salesmen shaking hands

1041

with the military dictatorship

1042
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,770

deny it that they were doing this

1043
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,960
right composite his the problem be
stopped using Fortinet another you Cisco

1044

the situation for every person in the

1053
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:10,109
world

1054
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:14,098
by contributing to this network by
checking a box in some software
