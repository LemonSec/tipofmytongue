1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,709
I just again I i apologize. not so
you've heard this but maybe not everyone

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:04,279
has

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,240
for few scheduling updates where I still
an hour behind in this room will remain

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,210
an hour behind

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,500
and then at 1 a.m. there'll be a few
films

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,580
in here and our selection leave getting
the full details on the films but there

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,250
are

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,910
film zebra haven't seen before can be
pretty interesting hacker

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,190
history culture taxes thanks I'll be 1
a.m. Robert Steele

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,340
is going to start at midnight not in
this rumor was scheduled

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,280
but in the next room in a Tesla room and
the only other change

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,940
arm to this hour of thing in the bell
room

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,010
the smaller room back there is that tied
the

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,690
telephone folks are just starting up
right now

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,500
so we moved and after social engineering
and everyone else form an hour behind

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,180
schedule

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,239
there and I wrote this down son she a
paper on the on class size case

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,290
we have a concert starting up your gun
club as well

19
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,930
starting at 11:30 down in every 138 same
way down the mezzanine

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,920
I if you check out last night's concert
you know you can check out a nice

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,800
concert it was

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,289
really good stuff see have basically
three four five places to be

23
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:08,759
are for release next year for five hours
on media

24
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:11,869
conference Laura on 18 down in the
second floor

25
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,579
I think does a program updates and on

26
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,490
so it's good to serve their necks
offices circuit bending with Jimmie

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,170
Rodgers

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,619
so

29
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:27,289
live everybody an ass I'm Jimmie Rodgers
and

30
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:30,380
I've got a lot of stuff to cover in a
little bit less time than initially

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,649
hoped for but I am

32
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,569
it worked really hard on this
presentation so here's the first line

33
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:40,579
oh yeah think thank you

34
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,020
thank you and that that actually did
take me 20 minutes 0 and usually when

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,359
you have the whole presentation like
this but I am

36
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,689
edges you know went with just comic sans

37
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,590
sir and same Jimmie Rodgers I am

38
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,149
a full-time hacker in Meeker on May
basically travel around most often with

39
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,669
Mitchell man and I am

40
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,810
teachable cider and make things I have a
number a bomb

41
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,880
open source electronic youth and Dom
I've been teaching circuit bending and

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,520
running

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,680
and workshops and classes for the past
like three years or so

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,050
om anti-muslim the Boston area

45
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,580
marianna then calmly site for a while
sorry about my voice I've been talking

46
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,030
pretty much for two days

47
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,080
on so it's on the skyline um

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,510
so here is actually ran going to dump
all the information if you have to our

49
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,950
code you can to snap a picture that
there will be another slide at the end

50
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,970
for questions

51
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,300
so on you don't have to take picture now
if it's not available

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,940
and that it'll just be on the website
offers a slides in everything

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,390
um they are so for software is sickening

54
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,160
I it's just modifying ways electronic
instruments are

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,010
radios even on some the first half was
on displaying and noticing the he get

56
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,370
interference of %uh via

57
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,000
a radio that was sitting in a middle
drawer you notice our kids weird things

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,740
it's essentially causing interference in
a signal I

59
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,590
shorting circuits on building where

60
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,470
the electricity is going to be going in
that changes with that supposed to be

61
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,950
doing

62
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,980
am the the first more that the person
you is I credit is being there for sick

63
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,570
for other sickening as I read is Allah
our mother he takes no claim to that

64
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,090
title

65
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,780
om G coined the term in the sixties sign
for

66
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,820
some radio and electronic experiment on
I instruments it was doing at the time

67
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,920
arm but there are two books that are
incredibly still have

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,100
I if you are interested in com creating
electronic instruments in general and a

69
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,720
sickening in general I am

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,680
the first one there was more useful to
me was a handmade electronic music and

71
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,530
the second volume in sound and

72
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,880
it has about one chapter on second
inning but all the other chapters

73
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,269
pertain to a lot of what I'm gonna be
covering very quickly in this hoc

74
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,980
which is arm essentially how to change
timing on circuits how do I

75
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,180
like how to filter it how to change
waveforms all kinds of stuff and it's

76
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,200
extremely useful

77
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,740
a circuit bending my read is Ali he
covers a lot of very specifics

78
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,870
farm instruments arm as Wilson the
generals and some the tools and think so

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,840
on it's also a good book to pick up if
you are interested in um

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,129
so first off some they're really common
a simple

81
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,930
easy seconds om a a guess

82
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,370
I should show you Anna most things leak

83
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,860
the Sables easy button here and you can
at least get a timing

84
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,840
pitchman each so you can kinda slow it
down but also I

85
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,840
if he slowed down a lot you get quiche

86
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:46,939
and um that's actually pretty common to
find in most ways you can find a sec

87
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:49,520
event it's going to be like that occurs
most

88
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,560
things are you gonna be playing with are
two simple simple type things

89
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,930
on but not everything relies on that
circuit

90
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,039
%ah sometimes it's a voltage train our
you actually

91
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,949
decreasing the amount a parent available
for the circuit mom

92
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,189
so the way that the timing circuits work
for these oftentimes is I

93
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:13,539
the they wanna make these things as
cheap as possible so a crystal was

94
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:14,610
actually gonna cost

95
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,199
3 45 cents dad accurate timing

96
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,229
am so these issues EI a simple

97
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,128
capacitor and resistor so capacitor is
an electronic component that's right to

98
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,180
charge

99
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,400
and in the case the circuits are
actually filling them up with

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,569
electricity and then letting

101
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,879
drain so it's kinda like when those
Japanese water fountains you know

102
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,919
seen in the gardens fill up with water
again Indy out in a dunk

103
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,258
um so that dunk is maybe I'd thousand
the secondary 10,000 the second or

104
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,199
whatever the computer the
microcontroller

105
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,189
on in that way is declaring asiana a
period of time

106
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:51,210
um but the thing that's laces even
though he can change really on the

107
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,068
flight the size in a bucket

108
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,699
the size of the tumor the size capacitor
you can change the REIT

109
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,509
of current that flows into that both
water and electricity the analogy works

110
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,629
both ways

111
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,360
um so kinda like how you take the water
not late the water faucet

112
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,409
slow the current be slow the rate that
it changes you slow the rate that the

113
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,210
microcontroller makes it sound so that's
the kinda basis if timing circuits are

114
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,948
you change resistance

115
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,479
you change the speed but the things
really nice by resistance is everything

116
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,378
is resistor disavow your resistor

117
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,360
resistors to Chalmers everything on
voltage train works in a similar way

118
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,309
where

119
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:28,349
am the it actually

120
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:32,719
affects the same circuit because sorta
like you're dropping water pressure on

121
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,819
the sudden so it's gonna move slower
because there's less water pressure

122
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:40,960
ID output is really really good at your
toys if you can easily very

123
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,589
any kind of audio recording and things
are done on covers antifreeze and going

124
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:45,330
out later

125
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,789
and power switch and it's really
important because oftentimes you can

126
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,080
crash into a

127
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,139
and Dom you need a power switch turn
on/off were

128
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,789
um just a lot a lot a lot it's wages

129
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,300
their always online in its kinda
annoying cuz you do it in a bag in this

130
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,909
is certain

131
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:04,058
76 singing your um

132
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:08,249
weighs 60 pounds and tells you how easy
it is the left which is completely ally

133
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:14,159
com so some more advanced fans these are
not always available in two ways: arm

134
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,539
if you have a really complex we can add
a patch may hear

135
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:21,998
am so the passkey acts actually lets me
get to you

136
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:25,330
a couple on but

137
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,369
on

138
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:33,789
so it allows me to you on the fly and I
change a couple things are more advanced

139
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:34,779
ways like a

140
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:38,550
Cassie keywords and things like that
that are well-known on these a patch PEs

141
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,479
for that

142
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:45,068
arm having glitching crash configuration
so the glitches or to play come

143
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,960
what was going on there with the easy
button weary kind of calm

144
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,399
you bring the circuit to a point where
it doesn't really like it also it just

145
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,729
freaks out it makes a lot of weird
noises

146
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,899
on says kinda glitching out crashing is
actually

147
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,629
I as the circuit is just completely
falling down

148
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,809
army will make some the more interesting
sounds as a kind died

149
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:10,619
if Tom then you have to reset the switch
a surgeon dr. crystals changing out

150
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,479
things like that are you can change it
dramatically change the speed

151
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,029
the toy and change your capacitors kinda
the same way I can change reforms that

152
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,330
and a few other things

153
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,479
and something the really against his
MIDI controller will

154
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,210
oMG or addressing at three sequences so
I am

155
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,939
there's a Furby use choir out there
that's pretty friggin hilarious

156
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,039
um so it's a sequence addressed

157
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,650
series for bees Tom so unfortunately you
didn't

158
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,340
the speed the stock and is not can be
able to show Lake all these video clips

159
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,640
and sound clips played

160
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,699
it's all on YouTube and things and I'm
gonna put some stuff in the link dump

161
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,140
on probably today or tomorrow om

162
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,030
so what to look for when you're looking
for something to circuit band

163
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,900
battery-powered is way preferable unless
you really know what you doing

164
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,189
um so now being said

165
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,560
you need to take any new web voltages
you're working with the toy

166
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,650
because and some tweaks you can
absolutely kill them I i've

167
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,400
heard a lot of people say oh six innings
easy all you have to do is just a couple

168
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,829
wires around

169
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,030
and that's true for a lot of toys but I
for things specifically like the Furby

170
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,880
where they have motors and things %ah
they have a much higher current

171
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,939
to driving the motors I am

172
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,120
that if you cross that nine volt motor
driving current over to the three volt

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,110
Voice circuit it pops and its 10 mom so

174
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,270
units revolt and 4.5 volts those are
pretty safety like this can poke around

175
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,480
in some wires

176
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,030
its exports you should start using some
two geometries in series on

177
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,350
get to that later an 89 Baltimore you
definitely need to have protection are

178
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,860
you gonna kill you toy

179
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,110
om you don't care that's fine but did
something that was really hard to come

180
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,060
by and in this case is collectors item
so

181
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,040
com I wouldn't be able to get another
one am

182
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,849
so I toys with kinda fun sounds samples

183
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,540
arm something that's neat about that is
you know first of two something the fine

184
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,290
it's interesting something that says
something interesting for you

185
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,390
om but you really need to play within

186
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,780
can see how it works because there's a
lot of things arm

187
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,180
deter not very preferable simply disease
even if I hold it down

188
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,840
it does nothing let it go makes a stash

189
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,290
um specifically pressing the button

190
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,510
it only ever plays out once they can get
to lubricate get a repeaters can have

191
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,790
refractory period of sorts for the delay

192
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,670
and Dom thats not very pleasant have to
go through external circuits to get a

193
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,319
tulip

194
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,610
but other two ways I

195
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,680
missed that's kinda much

196
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,020
um more preferable can situation so if I
had their hold on the bundle repeat or

197
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,480
five press a multiple times I can get it
to trigger multiple times

198
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,630
I'm so that's really great for sequences
or dis alternately having its way they

199
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,260
can be on in the background

200
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,770
um but they're oftentimes limited to
very few excludes there's nothing more

201
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,860
that way than is making sounds

202
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,920
on the Deccan oftentimes you worth it I
so that easy but

203
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,270
even though I can only present once I
can get some crazy town Saturday

204
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,790
I can write that early two minutes or
more om

205
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,589
and it's great for samples I if you do
any kind of on digital sequencing a

206
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,280
computer

207
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,089
arm background noises neck and stuff so

208
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,200
toys and audio input are amazing Tom

209
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,690
kinda my favorite either their sleep the
party karaoke machine which is kind of

210
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,430
hilarious

211
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,030
has assigned echo effect in it that's
just spectacular

212
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,650
um but also I in a lot of the joystick
microphone inputs

213
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,860
and others are sometimes I P amplified
so you can actually run a guitar Stewart

214
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,460
Street

215
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,270
without having a lake actually amplify
it so in this case %ah my have run

216
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,439
guitars through it and I can use the
patch be to have kind of a modular

217
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,190
guitar synthesizer

218
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,440
mom and things like that affects panel
that's pretty crazy

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,440
but and so I ease monetary fund consuls
oftentimes as EI frequency oscillator

220
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,190
%ah the

221
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,820
serve yeah it's really nice that the IDM
for because you can't I that way to get

222
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,490
there

223
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,610
and that which ones with the faxing it
has and

224
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,050
and in this case it's a changing them on
your voice to sound like a robot or

225
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,590
something like that I have a

226
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,940
if it as echo effect delays and things
like that is really great

227
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,860
am so another thing that's really
important his ID to the 2a

228
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,060
I recently went to China and i cant ive

229
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,190
purchase Lee although the twins are
defined and Dave

230
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,540
my room is overflowing with joy is a
douche keep buying them

231
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,689
om for finding them in very serious and

232
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,960
now that I'm new and it's a given
people's leave them for me but I when I

233
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,540
find general these the nineties TD early
2000's are kinda the Bascom

234
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,740
it's for the really perfected the chip
on board I think it's

235
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,850
you've seen it if you've ever seen and
second part com fairly cheap

236
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,720
manufactured goods it's like that black
epoxy blob

237
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,150
so they're actually making the circuit
on top the board and that a pox easier

238
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,630
to protect the circuit

239
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,680
om so

240
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,550
in their early 2000's on that process
really got more refined

241
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,190
combat a lot in factories and then
turned over but now they have

242
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,370
and so now even like that she be cheap
toys ease to be able actually do

243
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,300
something with their

244
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,480
like completely useless because om not
only do they have

245
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,080
on the timing circuit is underneath a
chip on board

246
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,480
hours previously wasn't good enough to
actually have the capacitors in there in

247
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,250
to the other stuff but um d have drowned
out protection for my anchors on

248
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,600
parents don't tickle me ongoing
hahhahahah

249
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,920
her as the batteries die um

250
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,590
so lemme yeah it

251
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,600
so what ends up happening is as Elmo

252
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,280
goes through puberty a little bit I it
just eventually cuts off

253
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,390
and and it seems like it's dead even
those credited you slash

254
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,189
mom so those are things you definitely
need early look out for in two ways on

255
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,720
the more sophisticated the 28

256
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,830
on and the newer the toy the more likely
you can run into the situations that

257
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,780
doesn't mean that it's completely and
bendable but

258
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,390
com you gonna run into a lot of fun
problems along the way

259
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,130
on be a things look out for is novelty
Lake

260
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,330
my listings speaks Esperon to really

261
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,740
that people actually that is awesome um

262
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,330
but does it have audio output a lot of
times keywords and things like that how

263
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,870
did but occasionally you'll have

264
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,650
destroys it put headphones on in town
which is means is me I guess parents

265
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,480
like that cuz

266
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,820
you know you can to see you can the
corner and have them make sounds and

267
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,100
doesn't bother them

268
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,020
and but does the case have actually have
rooms for sickening I had this weird

269
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,710
thing where I like the two ways to beat
always

270
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,180
om so what is a good manners take the
the components out in re case them in

271
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,190
do really cool stuff and that's there's
nothing wrong with general I've seen

272
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,870
amazing artistic pieces

273
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,130
the no way that I actually preferred
that way ask on it

274
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,900
and even dr. breakup occidental for this
one com

275
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,220
this is the original to in this is the
breakout box it try to match the color

276
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,220
and everything

277
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,220
to the original to as opposed to the
other way around

278
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,980
um but also how small mason new is that
way because the smaller it is a smaller

279
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,210
the components

280
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,770
and the less room you can actually have
to work in that space or

281
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,620
com a harder time you're gonna have us
honoring two components as you're not

282
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,140
used to dealing with service not
components

283
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,760
mom you can have a much more difficult
pending hands

284
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,450
um so where do I find ways and usually
secondhand stories unless you live in a

285
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,950
really really read treated state like
Massachusetts

286
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,740
and cuz they passed this law we have to
test all toys from had

287
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,880
and that also applies to you on second
hand stores

288
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
essentially like they can't sell them
anymore second hand cuz he cant afford

289
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,990
to test all the toys to the get thrown
away

290
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,220
om so actually have friends you get him
singing all the time and I'll

291
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,680
me go behind that could well and get all
the toys and there but

292
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,230
for the markets a great %ah because you
can actually sit there and tell us that

293
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,370
way simply with them taking its roots as
well the usual and the batteries in them

294
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,690
so you can play with them see if that's
what you want

295
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,470
um and if anyone lives near
Massachusetts her

296
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,700
near Boston area in ninety as a flea
market there's a few other people who

297
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,820
cater to circuit benders and bring toys
and other things like that in there and

298
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,970
that's really awesome

299
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,060
on the EVA um usually you can find stuff
did

300
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,720
just by looking at the two way
high-minded see if it's going to be

301
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,210
something interesting and thus allow

302
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,800
heart that moms need for like really
really young kid and

303
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,880
om it's actually the cutest thing ever
see about a few a few bucks on eBay and

304
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,170
when you turn it on it says I love you
in ages actually haven't had a hard to

305
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,529
lead changes the only then they could
find was just the I kinda the timing

306
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:54,070
circuit

307
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,760
then bed it's so cute I just had the
idea how plane they just use it as a

308
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,689
sample

309
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,890
I in it but I after holiday sales agree
so um

310
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,730
specifically in the big box stores so if
you go to Target or whatever

311
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,760
mom like December 26 is the best day for
sickening ever

312
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,829
am cuz just all of that crap is

313
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,159
their am so

314
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,819
some other things you gonna need I it's
not terribly complicated new might

315
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,359
actually already have it and that things
for opening

316
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,689
things thats pretty important oscar De
Vries

317
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,830
com miss you doing high-tech toys you
don t make Exeter

318
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,929
on the turks grease or anything like on
com

319
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,890
but you do need a lot of patience if you
don't wanna break the things cuz they

320
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,860
often times he's a snap to fit

321
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,920
can it adds and I can be pretty annoying
um

322
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,370
various resistors I'll sue
potentiometers various sizes a generally

323
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,240
sick linear

324
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,850
Qassam get the gradual change but in
some cases you might wanna go without

325
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,330
analog which has allowed rhythmic

326
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,860
scale it depends on that way an
alligator clips are really good cos you

327
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,150
can be easing out to connect thanks for
testing purposes

328
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm wired various sizes um

329
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,640
a generally actually go with that 30
gauge speaker wire Amazon going with the

330
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,710
structural thing it's

331
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,850
really then why are you can break it
very easily by Tom

332
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,149
it's great for sneaking around things in
a

333
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,300
just a double hockey you gotta data from

334
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,010
resistant so it is a break off so easily
a soldering iron of course the better

335
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,360
side earning have the

336
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,860
more easily you can be able to work with
the smaller Comte ways

337
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,730
cider I go with the leaded stuff I

338
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,870
the lead free is really bad cuz I just

339
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,390
takes more heated tome get it to melt
and Dom

340
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,170
here you're more likely to break
connections to be more frustrated to get

341
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,150
the lead star

342
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,330
a driller drop row say usually dude he's
a dremel

343
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,399
a multimeter but the best to love all is
ninety per hand reamer

344
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,190
I have to have them downstairs you can
see their majesty

345
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,200
an essentially use these things to you
get holes to fit

346
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,590
on that's how I get everything in all of
my cases to look exactly like they

347
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,879
should have always been there

348
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,200
because om their only is big enough it's
the park as you to scan at Lake

349
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,630
hand drill it out in the Eve test the
party and without us the part to it

350
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,120
works

351
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,520
om their amazing girly 15 boxes get one

352
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,450
arm so now how to kind it's a cabin

353
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,100
and the first thing I like to do is play
with the toy and

354
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,210
I mean really am thats at my excuse for
in US

355
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,080
baby I just how does respond I can test
the buns occasions before

356
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,500
mom are the sounds actually something
you like am

357
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,059
do all the buttons work D need to do
some work with it I actually prefer to

358
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,010
is it looks like it's a playoff with
Italy

359
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,430
buttons have sleep and rubbed off the
first thing I sometimes have to do is

360
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,120
text the two-way

361
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,400
mom so things like um friendly plastic
or Styrofoam

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,610
plastic and whatever you wanna call it I
it's really get really breaking some the

363
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,610
broken of tabs and things like that

364
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,660
on can you get a crash regardless
offending so like the %ah

365
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,340
a good example is the come speak n spell
like there's a couple button

366
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,850
combinations he can get it to freak out
for a week minutes at a time

367
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,400
on without ever actually opening the box
it's pretty cool

368
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,530
um then you just open up an exploit

369
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,050
but use your hands first so the thing
that's

370
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,909
really important news om you.re
resistance

371
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,290
are you are resistors so you provide
resistance is circuit so like when you

372
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:24,740
touch

373
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,740
making shredding various points in
circuit I am

374
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,280
it's not likely to try anything hi
unless its

375
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,260
plugged into the wall which he shouldn't
be touching any means om

376
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,110
but they usually have a a beer or other
cool beverage on hand in disc and he's

377
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,070
cool condensation from that and

378
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,129
touch around on the circuits I wouldn't
advise looking it cuz the

379
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,260
somebody industrial things depend on
their

380
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,410
ambit looking for resistors get either
really quick kennan second enzyme

381
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,620
kinda getting the timing changes and
seeing if they're there

382
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,140
I am they'd take notes breakdown
anything you see

383
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,870
I'm usually after three or four points
Acer writing things down for that you

384
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,210
can remember it

385
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,340
I am and when I find interesting things
or does competence and fresh leaded

386
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,379
solder

387
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,370
on to that point an insider in a bit a
wire that we can curb in alligator could

388
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,320
later

389
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,720
com be a so the way then start exploring
is an alligator clip with them

390
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,550
one meg I linear pot in series with its
own have a

391
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,000
live in the middle of the on the side
and essentially goes through that

392
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,559
because

393
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,580
Acer catching around in even that one
may kill

394
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,149
here like a little debt will be late any
Rory and so

395
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,660
League that's just enough that you know
that that's appointee should explore

396
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,670
answer the needs keep turning it down
Mike Corder by half until it does

397
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,150
something interesting

398
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,670
um be a I if it's like a soda and 3 vol

399
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:55,090
4.5 all weekend is can only keep
releasing indefinitely but if it's %ah

400
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,270
on like a much higher voltage to you

401
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,809
really wanna watch out cuz you'll
definitely pop something

402
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,010
bombay at insert tying things to ground
randomly

403
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,510
on the this is a point it's interesting
at this other point and just bring it

404
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,780
over to ground 0 depp's don't ever tight
to the positive voltage

405
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,678
mom unless you really have protection in
the way

406
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,870
because you'll definitely try something
and the train appearances

407
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,710
start touching around just see what
happens om

408
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,250
until you figure out what's going on
with the circuit

409
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,850
on and just because it stops making a
sound as minutes then I love people like

410
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,020
that way you'll get it to crash in all
make

411
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,860
really cool sound and then it doesn't do
anything usually just bought the

412
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,710
batteries have mac n

413
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,510
mom but also if you've removed any
resistors anything make sure you still

414
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,260
have resistance to complete that circuit
because it's not completed its not going

415
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,309
to start or if your resistance is too
low in my not actually start either

416
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,000
on so reset switch is ur peaceful kazi
kids go

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,510
toggle toggle and the to research
working again

418
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,150
I am so tuning the resistance for the
two is actually a little bit complicated

419
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,040
but

420
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,649
so once you're below that crash week on
there's some point they

421
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,020
you need some amount of resistance there
for the circuit to start

422
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,879
whatsoever arm so some say commanders
and a nearly

423
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,920
they don't like to put and anything in
series with their stuff like they let it

424
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,809
go into that crashed on it right now but
I like my two is to start

425
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,300
any time regardless om the caisson
disease even actually

426
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,770
at its lowest point I press the button

427
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,600
and it's actually going to take a while
before it starts combat this is a

428
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,350
comfortable

429
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,230
setting for me yes some pitch

430
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,400
so what was going on there is some

431
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,570
the timing at the circuit was slowed
down so much

432
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,770
that it was taking you know seconds to
start say kinda founders on that was

433
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,450
comfortable where

434
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,580
on it was a arrange that it started
enough time that it wasn't too bad but

435
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,290
also um

436
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,340
I can explore that kind its own even
lower once it does start

437
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,020
and so essentially keep Brees

438
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,240
reducing resistance until it stops
working in a measure the multimeter and

439
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,190
then kind of

440
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,710
pecan solid resistor com to them put in
series with that said you know

441
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,920
drop below it com but %um what use are
finding interesting things

442
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,350
take up the original resistor and just
start exploring answer get with where

443
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,160
you found a previously see things change
see i dont does

444
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,270
mom but there's Kenneth remain

445
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,360
controls that you can use on for
changing their resistance at

446
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,610
potentiometers is a sad for early

447
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,220
generally to linear kinda movement om

448
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,110
upper down for how you're changing
resistance and thereby changing the

449
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,650
circuit

450
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,080
and then the timing and circuit but I am

451
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,939
other findings are fed a resistor so
comforters a series connection can give

452
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,400
you a

453

454
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,760
but that doesn't work in all our lending
conditions this is great because I've

455
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,540
directly ding and their actions

456
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,629
not fluorescent cousin the fluorescence
is thing you hear the 60 Hertz bus and

457
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,090
it's really knowing

458
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,639
and so that's something you need to keep
in line with voters as you say can be

459
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,260
awesome but

460
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,440
not always really reliable control a
touch can

461
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,150
contact sir my favorite because you can
learn them over time

462
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,929
so Lake learning any other instrument
you actually learn how to play years ago

463
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,030
been toy

464
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,010
on and I actually prefer to use easy RCA
jacks

465
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,740
on and automate ways cuz you can get
them and large patch panels are really

466
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,120
cheap

467
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,070
everybody has those RCA cables that you
have to look to really see ours and

468
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,230
things like that

469
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,950
and but also the metal quality is really
high

470
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,360
so they make great touch contacts but
I'll see can become of forearm

471
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,580
you can at that photo resistor leader to
those such contacts

472
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,850
in things like that she can make a
modular system other things

473
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,840
they should decide be subtle how the
sicker performs on how to control skins

474
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,530
they'll respond a little bit differently
am like I said before unique you may

475
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:14,990
need

476
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,410
the resistor in series so that it
doesn't drop below that om

477
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,160
and basically pick a potentiometer often
with the controls you

478
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,220
one ours if you don't wanna make
potentiometer and you might get Lake

479
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,059
really slow the Lakers like are

480
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,720
the main act not actually be useful to
you you may not want that you might

481
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,150
actually wanted to be a sound simple so

482
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,590
you get that into you the 500 gained it
certainly I N

483
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,390
you know can have a little bit more
interesting on the big financial matters

484
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,950
you get big sweeping changes

485
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,299
om overtime and I it's really hard to
get direct

486
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,610
controls unless it's a zone that just
makes really nice Tom

487
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,960
really nice sound because an what might
be only

488
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,980
10 degrees I love interesting I if you
go to a smaller potentiometer it's like

489
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,410
you know a 180 degrees and interesting
zone the you can play with and get

490
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,080
different sounds but that always ASM

491
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,360
doesn't always matter on sometimes I'll
actually use two different

492
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,960
potentiometers one for the slow and
winter 13 p.m.

493
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,820
the short interesting zone one for adult
larger sweeping changes but that depends

494
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,230
com so I D out is important

495
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,230
om ITF

496
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,679
really good and to be able to bring up
the sound samples and

497
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,890
tight came another two ways on

498
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,330
blakey have to going to be a little bit
careful because

499
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,909
if you wire a positive and negative in
12 way it's not gonna really matter if

500
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,130
you plug it into stereo

501
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,809
it's gone on to equalize Kors on the
ground is actually what is referencing

502
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:47,918
of love

503
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,500
on but if you do that same thing and
plug that into the input in another 20

504
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,799
they're both my turn of you my friend
one or the other see need

505
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,809
to be careful about that this measure
with the potentiometer

506
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:02,149
she was positive she was negative and
where things get in the way

507
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,260
um oftentimes a lot a tweezer

508
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,600
the the signals really hot so I am

509
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,730
what I mean is when you plug into sounds
system you're actually gonna see it like

510
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,940
pickin read the whole time and that's
not really good for getting any kind

511
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,460
have

512
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,360
on coherent audio out about orient you
om

513
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,559
performance or anything so I that the
simple as we doing this is just

514
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,870
take a 10k potentiometer have your
signal coming in

515
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,390
when signal going out you're out with
the other going to ground com

516
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,470
and you have mine control in no time you
can learn a lot of

517
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,720
and it's just one additional part you
know after Lake am

518
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,049
do any calculations on that on also

519
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:47,360
kind of tax to be pretty interesting I
am

520
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,090
so without a kind of Jack if you'd high
street to the speaker

521
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,299
you can actually use your speakers and
microphone it's a poor make fun but it's

522
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:02,200
a microphone

523
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,780
casting camp some doesn't work so well
but

524
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,620
you can usually get some sound out of it
on

525
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,640
usually for these even they don't bother
with the kind of tax plan on for other

526
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,870
toys you definitely do when your mom

527
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,299
having audio output am hey

528
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,700
directly connected to you on what's
going into your

529
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,120
sound system chiasso pick up
interference and things like that

530
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,260
I so I template is awesome its present
in the toy

531
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,830
on their coupled with out there that on
his recordings plane back and have a

532
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,860
blue can do some things

533
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,919
um yeah of the times they have a jack

534
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,480
not always arm those sometimes have the
microphone that's built into it

535
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,990
on if they have a jack and the
microphones external and it's a tweet

536
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,600
that is has like a little I'm

537
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,790
teabagger phone then it probably has a
preamp

538
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,700
and that's really awesome cuz like I
said you can play guitar into it and I

539
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,340
use that as an effects pedal a sensually

540
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,799
mom but did the Los ok enough

541
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,379
its yeah it it'll cut off some %uh the
craziness

542
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,010
will happen when you input some from
other two is on some some from the two

543
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,890
is

544
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,790
be I usually just if it has Mike
descended across the microphone pans and

545
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,440
you're good to go

546
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,450
mom other times after tie 2-1 in the
microphone pins and

547
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,630
the ground actually to ground because
I'll be referencing of the pen on the

548
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,580
maker controller which isn't so good

549
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,699
well-meaning an not if you wanna bring
in but that is a microphone and

550
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,290
US com so some in the event stuff that
is around

551
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,460
com gad these

552
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,900
always take a lot more time a a call in
advance City Court I'm

553
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,140
on but it's usually a lot more
exploration to be honest

554
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,900
so the patch bays are for when you run
into you fifty points did

555
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,400
are really awesome so some the keywords

556
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,980
to see people with these hugely 16 by 16

557
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,230
patch panel basin leak they don't even
know with the stinking the only

558
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,380
there's only so many times you can
explore in some combinations for

559
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,330
the cyst in cinemas in this one it's a
four by four so I've

560
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,659
learned pretty well mom what I can do
with this one with the couple alligator

561
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,350
clip sir

562
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,750
on things they can am but

563
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,110
patch fazer awesome if you have a
complex story

564
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,929
and it also confuses are the people so
it's kinda funny

565
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:29,130
and so exploring with capacitors on
Canon changing amount so

566
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,960
actually if you get some mom various
size

567
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,900
ceramic disc capacitors zone don't play
around the electrolytic unless you

568
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,080
actually know what that means in know
you doing with them

569
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,909
am because oftentimes the large big
passengers and their

570
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:49,360
mom can shock you when you touch them
and especially did something with the

571
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,400
flash League

572
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,620
you can actually turn those things in
the stunning San guns sound you know

573
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:53,980
just

574
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,240
be careful with the large capacity so
nicked a little ceramic disc ones are

575
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,059
great

576
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:02,260
and dis bridge them with other capacity
sir bridge them with diabetes are things

577
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,210
com essentially urged her like you are
before

578
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,410
but now using additional components it
takes way more time and I am

579
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,210
I only do that when I find it weird that
actually does interesting things when

580
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,260
I'm exploring in the first place

581
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,150
on also there's a lot of ways that have
video output on special nowadays

582
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,720
am plug into the TVs and things like
that and I am

583
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,030
said karaoke machines those can be
pretty fun

584
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,660
but you can get a lot of interest the
artifacts in things like that

585
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,590
gay even open and game boys in thirteen
get some we can if

586
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,520
it is the fight is touching on circuits
am

587
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,000
so triggering button presses is kinda
picky

588
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,950
am so like in the case in this easy
button

589
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,650
from getting this to loop when you want
to loop is

590
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,980
for that way it's a non-trivial task UAE

591
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,100
an external chip for isolating a couple
things but some you can get away with

592
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,020
just a simple ol a cum

593
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,230
transistors a transitory to signal and
then either open or close

594
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,830
a larger voltage her larger signal

595
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,030
am so we can often times do is just

596
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,980
tirade the transistor to you the speaker
output

597
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,940
and if there's no kinda delay period
between when the sounds hurts when you

598
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,679
press the button

599
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,470
you can actually get to live very
quickly easily because what'll happen is

600
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,330
when you flip the switch on the
transistor reads at the speakers and

601
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,270
doing anything so it opens the gate

602
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,370
so that makes a sound happen which then
turns a speaker on which the transit

603
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,539
CC's that

604
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,710
there's now sound dampening silly closes
the gate

605
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,760
and then this is a speaker turns off
there's no longer sounds it opens the

606
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
gate again

607
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,370
and that that's a cool dude but that
doesn't really work for all the toys I

608
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,130
does work for the easy button

609
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,169
so way I have to do is get some kind of
an external

610
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:56,039
oscillator I'm so I there 555 timer

611
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,590
om he's had Schmitt trigger murders
switcher an

612
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,720
if you're really interested in a
Kentucky lied about its just a really

613
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,140
simple way of making

614
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,899
a square wave and then also make a
controller's canada.com

615
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:14,020
and essentially you couple that with an
outdoor ice leaders are not toys later

616
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,399
is AV component did mom

617
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,649
essentially as an LED and a photo
resistor coupled in a very small package

618
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:22,429
sOooo

619
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:26,210
when he ran a very small voltage across
it it will then drop

620
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,918
entirely the voltage across the other
two pens so um

621
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,069
by you know tying way a positive
voltages across a button to the apt

622
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,750
choice leader to turn on

623
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:42,250
closes essentially divine axes a button
press are you can read these relays for

624
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,179
that as well

625
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,700
I relays are expensive and com

626
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,389
dentist not really necessary miss Italy
have

627
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:54,250
on that's what Radio Shack and so that's
what you got and you can use them

628
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,730
on the tacit Eagle I quite a bit more
amperage

629
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,510
and powers so that some it uses a bit
more electricity essentially

630
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,690
so MIDI control is something that's
extremely exciting about.com

631
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,670
some other relief and sickening to is
because arm

632
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,960
like I said before you can have the up
to a slater's for remotely triggering

633
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,970
button presses so you can directly with
the keyboard control

634
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,440
the buttons that are being pressed on a
toy so that's like a little guitar with

635
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,470
buttons up the next you can map that
your keyboard you cannot that you MIDI

636
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,590
controller he came out that

637
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,369
anything mom but you can also I

638
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:34,410
within the MIDI a cancer she can
actually change

639
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,759
with the pitch is free to those commands
day they make these digital

640
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,119
potentiometers that

641
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,400
on three digital signal you can change
with the resistance is that it's

642
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,940
outfitting so

643
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,770
mom you can actually change both the
speed

644
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,820
and the triggering and that by om

645
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,960
through these digital circuits but also
if you have the maker controller

646
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,700
om you can generate square wave output

647
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,690
which you can actually replace the
crystal for the toy

648
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,580
and then you can with a bit of work and
believe coding can actually have you to

649
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,500
weigh on beats per minute

650
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,750
on which is really really freaking cool
mom

651
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,250
so you essentially have a completely
control to a and I

652
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,690
pointed out we know on here because
there's a MIDI library that's really

653
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,460
nice

654
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,869
you have access to these com all all
these commands her

655
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:27,470
available and it's pretty easy to
program and getting to you but you're a

656
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,270
couple other

657
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,270
com dedicated many boards that are out
there the Deacon lookup

658
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,470
om did add them in fairly quickly easily

659
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,810
om say ya there's a lot of

660
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,509
really great resources on the web mom
did

661
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,609
constantly have on

662
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:47,990
links to interesting things I get low fi
is a great website

663
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,990
hi they cover not only makes a convening

664
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,349
stuff that's going on around the rolling
sure really cool

665
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:58,660
mom and the people who see you too but
they also have %ah

666
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,440
they weekly um week any free albums that
are out there

667
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,310
cock is there's a lot of chip tuning and
circumvent and all kinds of other

668
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,910
electronic music stuff that just

669
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:11,500
given away for free that's that's
wonderful part the culture

670
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,940
on Casper electronics he's actually here
in New York

671
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,250
I am and

672
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,869
she doesn't want a very interesting
downs and publishes very clear

673
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:25,849
instructions online on the counter
replicate this thing so

674
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,200
om that the kind of interesting thing is
anytime somebody finds a really cool

675
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,570
circuit and

676
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,349
oMG you'll watch the yday president
thing gone from like two dollars to let

677
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:37,020
fifty dollars

678
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,270
Tom so said Berg karaoke machine

679
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,670
Anna it's this kind have really cheesy
pink plastic thing

680
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,020
wonderful and how completely horrific it
is an

681
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,150
went a girl with Mike Tom

682
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,920
and you can get the most ridiculous
sounds edit this thing because it's on

683
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,619
the attacks

684
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:00,900
hearing your voice term and that's a
given in dot com is a kind

685
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,090
interesting website that has links to
examples

686
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,869
and a couple other things a lot of
pictures its sometimes hard to navigate

687
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,500
but

688
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,330
and there is a good bit of information
there om

689
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,569
and been fast happens here in New York
every year

690
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,000
so you can talk to other like-minded
geeks

691
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,330
and shell this is all done and share in
treating people buy and sell toys and

692
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,730
all kinds of stuff

693
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,599
mom say %uh that's really awesome so
tomorrow at one o'clock in the hardware

694
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,780
hacking village

695
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,980
mom I'm gonna be doing circumventing the
easy button

696
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:43,300
and sides 25 bucks has all the parts and
access to my part dans om

697
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,980
so what are the things about and Kenneth
getting into hardware electronics is Ana

698
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,040
CA certifying

699
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,470
potentiometers to support my own habits
so my friends you can ima pot dealer

700
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:57,490
I am but yeah it's kinda truly K

701
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,840
have hundreds and pots is just all kinds
of values and things like that and my

702
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,470
friends will

703
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,810
literally contour like a dude I just
need some stuff from you

704
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,609
and yeah an

705
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:13,369
so you get access to you all those vans
and I will on

706
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:17,190
help youth room exploring the San
vacation before you can get some pretty

707
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,500
interesting sounds into this thing

708
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,090
register online if you're interested in
it as people screaming out a bunch easy

709
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,980
button so and run around Manhattan on
Thursday and Friday and I found

710
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,800
11 apparently not so man has 11 easy
burns

711
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,310
um so bring your own easy button if you
can find one outside then

712
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,580
Manhattan area 20 bucks in New get the
same parts

713
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,609
comforter is a seasoned on Kansas stuff

714
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:45,830
%uh right there

715
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:50,029
so I that's the QR code that will bring
it to you that hope talk things are

716
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,270
right now all there is is the
pre-registration

717
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:58,560
and Om also Deanna

718
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,670
com the link to my outlined above some
in the south today

719
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,670
mostly covered and I'll put the slide
show up once I have it and alter some

720
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,030
links up there at some point

721
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,589
thank are there any questions

722
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:18,349
it there's maker funds after

723
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,869
have you updated all with routing the
audio output

724
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:27,080
jack into an audio input jack producing
feedback loops like that

725
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,348
I had built into some to its

726
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:33,730
p

727
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,859
so that's exactly what I'm doing here
and it's just that early switch that

728
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:41,220
I tried talking about on Disick is there
a time delay in answer could

729
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,980
I own little bit but I'm not so much it
really kind if

730
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,310
an turns the whole thing to garbage so
much

731
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,299
I if I talk to is a car at like fair

732
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,530
the robot voice you heard me understand
what it's trying to say but I am

733
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,020
get it it really does digital stuff

734
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,250
so well and also stick around here to
see me later you can play with these two

735
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:04,800
ways

736
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,760
there out and available free to play
with me and some as second question you

737
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,270
get back to the video circuit bending

738
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,780
have you worked at all with feeding I
audio input into

739
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,140
video output I have not personally that
he was not one of my knee

740
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,400
and I direct interests among my friends
do it but

741
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,530
yeah I'm a sleek audio paintings

742
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:29,420
blade do that would be probably leary's
an awesome

743
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,130
I'll get on that yep these tried
actually

744
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:37,420
yeah oz or if you go into more detail
about the Barbie karaoke machine

745
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,390
what did you do you defend that and
results Egyptian

746
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,980
so hmm

747
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,650
and yeah I am explaining that to my
roommates now now I'm just

748
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,140
doing something kisses my job Central
Time Acharya have to play with toys

749
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,210
reliving

750
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,540
um so I gave it the bad touch

751
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,589
Space Wing mom when it was %ah

752
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:05,020
Noy it really that when

753
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,780
um it's mostly to get at those delicious
echo affectionately affects

754
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,359
on because you can actually the their
couple points you can change

755
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:19,520
%ah essentially like the decay in the
echo and all kinds of other things like

756
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:19,940
that

757
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,170
com through entirely analog means the
not

758
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,260
purpose whatsoever but I

759
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,310
Peter from Casper electronics really
covered it quite well

760
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,330
and %ah so that that is not one that
explored personally

761
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:37,140
am a lot as a given news really go for
like that way that people have never

762
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,839
seen before

763
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,420
on which is pretty calm but a lot of
other people just do you

764
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,790
but they have seen foreign that's fine
okay

765
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:52,089
so I am yeah any any other questions

766
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:56,690
him

767
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:01,210
so you talked a lot about vending toys
especially simple toys

768
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:06,330
arm to any of these things work on
really complicated systems like

769
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,569
game console yes all computers

770
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,540
yeah and actually there's a whole
aspects upset at the Argentine seen that

771
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,970
as a good bands a lot of cum

772
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:20,440
things like the %ah they give a fag I
actually sells a mod kit for the Gameboy

773
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,320
so that you can change the timing at the
Game Boy

774
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,480
and Om

775
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,690
did the homie control aspect and really
ups the game a lot cuz

776
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,040
oMG that that's a highly technical kind
of thing that you doing

777
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,670
arm and arm

778
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,520
yeah and summer the early stuff is
actually month finally accept the size

779
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,619
urs and keyboards and things like that

780
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:48,990
I am so the Cassie whiskey one is really
one

781
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:53,880
keyword an that's where that 16 by 16
patch panel being

782
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,290
has come from because they're really are
that many points that you can tie into

783
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,589
you and I don't think people in still

784
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:02,799
explored fully with an issue we can do.
om

785
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,820
and it's pretty crazy stuff so yeah

786
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,070
for okay

787
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,910
his movie but specific to

788
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,950
I'm they hear the funding for the BBC TV
series Doctor Who

789
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,230
okay and there is one specific toilet
came out

790
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,650
term 0 some insight maybe

791
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,810
years to go and which was basically

792
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,560
a remote-controlled toy it was actually
force controlled

793
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,460
to know if anyone has tried been that I
haven't seen that directly

794
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,480
but um like I said like some the
problems they're really modern toys and

795
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,320
saddam

796
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,910
there so sophisticated and trying to
protect you from

797
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,180
messing up dead and you can get a lot of
stuff

798
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:54,000
om so of times if you open something up
in you see the black blob in ICC coming

799
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,820
out of his league speakers and batteries
coming in and maybe the button

800
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,900
they disclose it you know you're in a
confined anything there

801
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,580
I'm but depending on how complicated the
toy is

802
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:10,020
I don't know I haven't seen it
specifically but if you have one week in

803
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,650
get the bad touch so to say

804
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,640
you push me I don't own one thing is
someone who does help then open it up

805
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,359
it

806
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,529
area and got about Lee use every more
minutes

807
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:31,150
any other questions are

808
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:34,210
I'm you win over the Barbie karaoke in
the air

809
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,800
speakers fellow to smother I guess like
really infamous

810
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,890
toys that have been then the the Fermi
pops up a lot

811
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,680
cuz om their kinda creepy to begin

812
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,680
and mom with many skin them Lakers youth

813
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,920
and its kinda Cavaliers but

814
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,420
yet it does have only a few few points
you can you billy

815
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,180
Dave definitely been sequenced and other
things like I am

816
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,649
play it gather there's a number by

817
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,670
keyboards that have are well-known TV

818
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,320
rate for bending in things like that
that circuit bending dot com website

819
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,200
covers a lot

820
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,060
love the really popular things and it's
out there

821
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:28,250
but actually the entire speak series
their speak in math um

822
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,730
and I'm sorry oh yes we can read

823
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:37,119
on they all use the same kind of TIA we
ship and they're all really really good

824
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,150
for

825
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:42,050
for getting some crazy sounds Nov om

826
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:46,000
p.m.

827
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Teddy Ruxpin have you besides

828
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,130
sound many have you ever have any

829
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:55,950
anything to deal with the mechanisms its
okay articulated

830
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:00,530
yet a little heey doesn't do he doesn't
do too much

831
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,670
ADF myself and receiving data and my
speaker being on

832
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,670
on which actually GSM interferences can
fun to play with him

833
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,849
animal sometimes good web sites is to
get the nutrients Benin's

834
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:15,510
um so Teddy Ruxpin specifically is
entirely mechanical

835
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:20,010
and I he displeases and antique

836
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:25,010
and that is directly translated in the
mechanical movement into the job

837
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,150
but there's some really really weird
ones out there let ya know

838
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:33,200
am nobody in this room should know what
it is because it is the creepiest toilet

839
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,599
ever had and I i cited the MIT flea and
I'm

840
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,060
I had this for a don't pay more than
like I D ten dollars on two ways

841
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,560
other ways like when you go to the
circuit bending swap meets and things

842
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,089
like that like Wendys if you don't like
crazy thing show up Lake

843
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:52,440
I would buy all the damn on but ya know
should at least twenty-five dollars in

844
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,700
it's like this is the most uncanny
valley disturbing

845
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,420
thingies a storyteller but he has the
cell full-feature features and controls

846
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,060
and things like that

847
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,930
on yes so there are two ways out there
that you can get

848
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:09,980
these weird damage chronic aspects to it
by

849
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,200
like I said before com usually the motor
circuits

850
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,780
and voice control circuits are very very
different voltages

851
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,599
sleek dramatically different voltages
and you have to identify which is which

852
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,140
they're usually separate circuit board
so that makes it a little bit easier

853
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,430
om but you just have to be very careful
when you're exploring those stories

854
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,500
on always have an

855
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,839
potentiometers in series with what
you're exploring when

856
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,250
on even if its on the when is obviously
the voice control board still

857
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,050
explore with protection they're
concerned the Furby you can kill in

858
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:43,810
about

859
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,740
have the second on cuz it's all on and
at the same circuit board

860
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,359
9 am

861
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:55,500
I haven't actually play with the Tickle
Me Elmo

862
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,730
but thats a if think it's entirely just

863
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,369
electrical and there's like a little
vibration Center

864
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:08,020
vibration motor in there but in is
probably the same deal

865
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,079
p.m. antonin has been I'm sure that

866
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,950
to get a letter from somebody com used

867
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,460
as I said this amendment that some
products now

868
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,070
happily who in its own you with three
parts

869
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,230
gathered speed they put a pox the
anti-government views

870
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,450
I me old Michael toys a recent toys

871
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:36,010
things had this is like now cream or
more

872
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,500
what's it's because that manufacturing
process go out cheaper

873
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,579
I'm so it's kinda the same way that they
do you i on

874
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,880
integrated circuits in the Cure
processors believe I did see those

875
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,130
pictures like the pentium chips where

876
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:51,560
they're just thousands of processors on
this big huge circle

877
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,240
and some percentage the bird is going to
fail

878
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,410
but they know that percentage in and
they just cut them out

879
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,578
so they actually manufactured on their
and then they just put the pox

880
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:05,750
top answer to very quickly have can give

881
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,730
not being able to use with some
essentially with the photography

882
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:14,099
is how they're building the stuff up om

883
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:17,630
but not anymore they'll do it for is

884
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:20,829
fuse cows in our class on Merkel China

885
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:24,700
Mikey you know something doesn't exist
you send an email and the next day and

886
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,130
we love to those

887
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:29,980
you known since com but yeah that'd

888
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,750
that manufacturing really sorry getting
a much cheaper in the past few years and

889
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,119
especially

890
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,780
recently cuz a lot more factories are
capable of doing it now

891
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:44,190
and Dom gases that that's way that the
future and second inning is

892
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,500
is nine com there's still tons tons a

893
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,800
mid nineties to mid-2002 a sitter really
really good for

894
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,800
and stuff in

895
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,700
now and i havent anti anything specific
to that but that's only gets rate for

896
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,119
hacking period

897
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:25,680
cuz usually can reverse engineer those
protocols for a couple things

898
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,040
get the doubt upon am leaders said the
Star Wars II kind of

899
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,950
mind control generating om it actually
talks RS 232 use

900
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,270
heaters hack into the thing and is for
them

901
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:42,490
unique is here for you suddenly getting
late be really really really low level

902
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:43,820
like brain waves can

903
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:47,190
stuff but yeah I mean

904
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,960
that's like anything that I wouldn't
even leaks are given for seventy like

905
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,910
when a kid

906
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,930
Sniffen to make you get to do and see

907
00:51:54,930 --> 00:52:01,380
re regardless com

908
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:08,380

910
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:17,430
like 45 benzene you decided you and if
you have an FTDI cable leadership that

911
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,920
makes it

912
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,150
really really really simple but om
essentially reeking of tx/rx

913
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,039
and its simple RS 232 Syria which is the
same thing it's

914

I am

916
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:36,509
and yet just with the serial

917
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:37,759
does get roddy to

918
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,059
from three different values at Lake when
it's Tom

919
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:45,420
if you know what it is like house wrong
signal is

920
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,660
with signal integrity is in and make way
this

921
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,859
actual signal is you know how high or
low it is

922

929
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:21,920
am if you get any questions I'll be down
hardware hacking area you were

930
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,359
