1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,430
let me ask me if you want I'm for

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,969
3i we have a fascinating variety of
people who put a whole lot of effort

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,160
into making information available turn
off love the stories

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,260
this is another one of those %uh stories
that I know you're gonna enjoy

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,550
if the rummaging the government attic

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,930
and this is so for with Michael

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,930
and Phil so please God

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,200
thank you for money was Phil Lapsley and
for the last several years I've been

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,230
researching a book on the history a
phone freaking actually presented on

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,000
that topic

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,560
a at the last open I'll be presenting
again tomorrow

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,390
at noon gonna related topic on cats and
mice

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,250
history a phone phreaks an FBI and and
the sort of thing I'm but

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,300
as one other research tools for the book
I've filed

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,180
a whole bunch a Freedom of Information
Act request with various federal

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,910
agencies

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,110
and in the process I started looking at
four and how it relates to

18
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,789
how I was trained as a hacker as a lot
of parallels the guy that I learned more

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,830
about four then from any other source is
this gentleman named Michael redness key

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,700
who is standing

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,330
right here and so and I thought that we
were talking today about

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,780
for how to file for your request and
what you can learn from

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,770
I cover my name is Michael Ravin its key
and

24
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,170
although I now work is a on attorney in
the communications field

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,220
for many years I worked as a journalist
investigative reporter and as part of

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,600
that

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,220
I use the freedom of information act as
a tool and

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,820
in doing so over the years I filed about
10,000 for a request

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,550
and a what came to my attention was that
there were some folks that were filing

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,500
for requests and posting information and
documents online

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,010
at this website called government attic
and

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,260
they're shy people but they agreed to be
interviewed by Phil and I and we learned

33
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,590
some

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,990
interesting lessons we opened we want to
share them with you today

35
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,790
imagine if you will

36
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,820
a vast library of documents and records

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,709
billions documents every document the US
government has ever created

38
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,019
that database exists it even has a name
for

39
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,190
it's called every document the US
government has ever created it hasn't

40
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,980
gotten around to throwing out yet for

41
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,590
you can clear this database by using an
obscure search engine

42
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,000
a powerful search engine called foia
hathaway's the Freedom of Information

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,909
Act

44
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,579
there are many parallels but there's
also some differences

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,939
Google's electronic fully is mostly
paper although it's changing to become

46
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:40,959
more electronic

47
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,230
a Google is based on the web for his

48
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,798
based on the postal service with Google
queries or instant but with flair

49
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,269
the queers can take weeks months years

50
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,829
many years with Google the search
algorithm

51
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:59,219
is this the search engine is a computer
with an algorithm

52
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,010
and with way the search engine as a team
of humans who are usually helpful

53
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,608
up they rely on computers to and the
information is spread through a whole

54
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:09,480
number places

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,518
Google tries to be helpful way tries to
be helpful mostly but it sometimes comes

56
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,230
across as rather hostile

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,879
petulant arbitrary every document in
this database has two things in common

58
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,048
first they were created with taxpayer
money

59
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,579
they're yours they're put away but
they're yours and

60
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,389
and every document stated a shed some
light on what the government's up to

61
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,510
but those documents stay hidden

62
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,980
unless you ask for them there's no
mechanism that's been developed to

63
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,129
systematically share these billions and
billions of records

64
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:49,290
with the public requesting documents
under 40 is a socially useful necessary

65
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,319
and perfectly legal for my packing

66
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,169
for example what happened with the BP
blowout

67
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,650
well we can find out we can learn what
the

68
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,269
email traffic with the minerals and
management of Management Service was

69
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,879
the weeks leading up to the blowout are
the days after that or the

70
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,419
phone conversations that may have been
recorded

71
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:16,418
with when this thing happened and so on
for

72
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,639
so kids are going to look at today
relook at what is a for a request

73
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,850
how you submit one what are the tools
and techniques for for hacking that is

74
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,740
how do you create

75
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,180
a you well-crafted and hopefully crafty
request is going to get you the

76
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,160
documents and records that you want to
find out about

77
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,530
array do that with a little bit of
lecture up-front covering some other

78
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,410
background but then

79
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,600
Michaels gonna talk about examples from
this website we mention government

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,660
addict out or

81
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,010
and we spent a budget i'm looking at
that website and

82
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,080
and talking to the proprietors are the
website try and figure out what are some

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,270
tips and tricks

84
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,960
but first we'll go with kinda the basics
of what is the fire request hey submit

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,140
one that sort of thing

86
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,580
so a4 request is as simple as

87
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,630
4 sentences this is all you need it can
be a fax it can be a letter it can be

88
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,670
email and you people say all the time
Michael constantly get that we can you

89
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,140
give me an example for a request

90
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,340
here's an example for a request dude oh
my god this is totally a request under

91
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,290
the Freedom of Information Act

92
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,150
I request you provide me with a copy of
all records regarding whatever

93
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,850
whatever has to be specific as to enable
the agency to figure out what it is so

94
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,700
for example

95
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,520
I want to copy of all radio traffic that
was from the Deepwater Horizon between

96
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,359
this time and this time that was
intercepted by the federal government

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,990
not that we'd ever interceptor on radio
traffic on

98
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm an individual requesting this
information for non-commercial purposes

99
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,330
I'm willing to pay up to twenty-five
dollars if necessary

100
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,130
thank you that's all it is four senses
that support request

101
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,630
K but you have to have those four senses
and their has this is a poor request

102
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,550
has described the records you want has
to give information for the fee category

103
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,060
about what's more the second

104
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,600
and has the state your willingness to
pay reasonable fees for

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,850
now here's what the fire process looks
like we're

106
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,820
you start off by mailing or faxing or
you're emailing in a request

107
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,080
and the government gets it they'll all
get

108
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,590
um they send you acknowledge my letter
probably you probably get that in a few

109
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,330
weeks

110
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,659
then it goes into a queue government
gotten better about this but

111
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,850
it takes a while for them to process it
and then they're gonna do a search for

112
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,460
records

113
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,570
now if they can find the records are
gonna send you a new records response so

114
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,330
you had a letter saying we search we
didn't find anything

115
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,640
now at that point you should be
scratching your head if you get an A

116
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,729
record response is thank

117
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,050
really did you really look for me did I
may be inadvertently word my letter in

118
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,070
such a way that

119
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,820
that you know maybe I made it to narrow
maybe I made it you know

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,020
the wrong in some way and that's where
you'll see there there's a feedback loop

121
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,690
because when you ever get a response
from the government usually it means OK

122
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,750
what can I do differently either to get
more documents or maybe that one didn't

123
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,620
work

124
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,880
a that that's the way it starts off the
back with their

125
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,120
assuming they define some records
they're gonna then it sit down look at

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,910
the records are gonna figure out if the
classified ad to declassify them first

127
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,920
then they're gonna go through and redact
out a bunch of stuff and the new to get

128
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,940
your documents and when you get your
documents

129
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,000
after you you know get done doing a
happy dance we having actually having

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,590
documents in hand

131
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,910
you're gonna look there is a 12 I this
mentions this thing I never knew about

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,560
this thing

133
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,710
let's file another for a request right
and I honestly think I mean I think

134
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,890
every time the FBI has given me
documents

135
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,780
for my phone free book I think every
time like God

136
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,770
you know we're gonna send in this
document lapses gonna send us twenty

137
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,469
more for your request me know exactly
how it's going to work this process

138
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,020
doesn't ever converge does never entered

139
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,450
for now how long does this take well

140
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,289
you know it'll take you a few weeks
maybe to get knowledge but later if

141
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,710
there are no records assuming that it's
not too burdensome

142
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,910
research is going to be a few weeks from
maybe a month

143
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,930
may be several months today if I'm not
out if it actually if they find

144
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,070
documents

145
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,950
that can take a long time especially for
classified especially if they're

146
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,960
voluminous

147
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,070
um I think the longest for your request
I've ever had

148
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,349
it took about three and a half years I
was from the National Security Agency

149
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,190
but Michael

150
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,560
for Woodford

151
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,880
but still have a couple that are hanging
around that are 10 one is 12 years old

152
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,520
and they tell me they're working on a
there they're making good progress

153
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,880
but they have a number of them that are
older than her in front of me in line

154
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,940
the MMM the good news is thats

155
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,480
thats unusual right I'm it does happen
just to set expectations so for example

156
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,850
if you want to file for a request for a
project that's due in school a month

157
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,460
from now

158
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,919
probably not the right thing for again

159
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,809
let's talk a little bit about money
about fees and just very nice both here

160
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,250
agencies are allowed by law to charge a
reasonable searching duplication fees

161
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,339
so they can charge you for the time that
it takes for them to search in some

162
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,320
cases and also for duplication

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,820
in some cases the fees are based on what
are called the categories there forever

164
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,029
there's not commercial requester which
is most folks there's representative

165
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:01,779
the news media there's commercial and
there's education or scientific

166
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:02,620
organizations

167
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,270
for most requests end up being either
free or a few tens of dollars but if you

168
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,540
have a big voluminous request

169
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,529
or you know it's a really complicated
surgery can actually

170
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:18,689
you know the several hundred thousand or
even more dollars two things here want

171
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,060
is you want to limit your exposure

172
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,950
you wanna state up-front how much it is
you're going to pay in your letter and

173
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,670
tell them call me if it's going to cost
more than twenty-five dollars whatever

174
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,189
it is

175
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,970
and then if the fees even reasonably
high call up the foyer officer at the

176
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,290
agency get him on the phone and say hey
what's up with this

177
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,930
with which P services is the part that's
causing the fees

178
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,709
so you can modulate the request
appropriately make changes

179
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,709
right is and the the r2 this is being
able to thread the needle so you

180
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,100
basically do not charge fees for
anything you ask for

181
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,910
if you're a reporter they don't charge
for search be so it's very limited and

182
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,800
they give out

183
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,089
waivers the fees but if you're an
individual looking for stuff

184
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,279
the art is framing the request so you
get what you want but you don't paint

185
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,339
for now

186
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:04,010
for Mike on have this theory we got the
toll booth they re

187
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,410
and it is that many agency is not all
but many

188
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,510
use fee is the way to dissuade
requesters on

189
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,510
now this is even just talking about
legitimate the is right for you file a

190
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,970
request with say the FBI and you wanna
know about

191
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,150
oh I know UFO's and it turns out that's
going to be

192
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,920
let's just say hypothetically 25,000
pages cuz the FBI don't know if it's

193
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,750
true or not was just a hypothetical they
have a lot of pages on your thoughts or

194
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,880
the CIA or whoever pick your favorite
agency

195
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,050
well if the church attendance the page
you're now looking at twenty five

196
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,900
hundred dollars for twenty five thousand
pages

197
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,000
so that's gonna dissuade you unless
you're made of money

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,360
um so in addition to that some agencies
charge a reasonable fee is or they will

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,730
make mistakes that make things all the
more expensive and so

200
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,020
week jokingly referred to as the toll
booth near the tollway keep people off

201
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,699
the highway

202
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,910
knowing the fee categories being willing
to reframe your request like mike was

203
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,180
saying to thread the needle

204
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,750
and discussing years request with boy
staff and especially the IT people are

205
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,940
requesting a database

206
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,490
that can go a long way towards making
sure that you don't end up paying extra

207
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:03,990
fees

208
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,910
one at one of the things that happened
is a lottery agencies have to improve

209
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,020
the processing and save

210
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,560
be become more efficient have actually
gone to electronic reduction in

211
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,589
processing so they scan everything in a

212
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,200
think manipulate electronically and they
can now put it as a PDF what that point

213
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,260
the duplication fees are essentially
zero

214
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,819
so the ability to dump stuff onto a CD
in mail to you or even better yet

215
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,350
email to you which is happening more and
more frequently is actually getting mad

216
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,410
at toll booth which

217
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,540
may seem like a good thing cuz they
don't have to photocopy hundreds and

218
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,410
thousands of pages if someone asks for
something

219
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,319
but the agency's get nervous about that
because they say were giving out

220
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,620
thousands pages but when I'm a toll
booth anymore

221
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,850
this is an easy pass system in someone's
getting a free ride so

222
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,930
sometimes there's there's a little
discomfort at the agency level with how

223
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,220
the how they control

224
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,290
people asking for things when there's no
way to charge fees for something they

225
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,719
think they should be used to control

226
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,470
wrote that made for get so let's talk a
little bit about exemptions

227
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,950
on unfortunately for us you know you can
treat you can request any document you

228
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,589
want the agency's don't have to
necessarily give it to you

229
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,760
because these things called exemptions
certain things are exempt from the

230
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,980
Freedom of Information Act

231
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,400
so they're allowed to black out a redox
some sections third

232
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,500
don't even have to give you anything if
the entire document is exempt and

233
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,650
exemptions range from national security
to privacy concerns to

234
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,880
go away thats internal stuff that really
doesn't years concerns the internal

235
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,060
operation ever agency that doesn't
concern you

236
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,950
there's nothing to see here move along
exactly right these are these are the

237
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,020
document you're looking for

238
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,300
honor for now

239
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm not gonna go through their there 10
exemptions I'm not gonna go through in

240
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,329
detail

241
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:37,459
I have even Google them whatever you
want to find out more about I'm at a

242
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,339
point out though

243
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,880
what they look like on this is here's a
document this is on tap which was the

244
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,380
predecessor to be able and both which
will present predecessor to 2600

245
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,459
magazine this is an FBI file on it

246
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:51,510
on and for you

247
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,560
redactions look like Swiss cheese
sprinkled with gibberish and the the

248
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,160
Swiss cheese is where the blacked-out
sections a doctor in this case wideout

249
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,959
the gibberish you see down on the margin
on the right hand side there is little

250
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,120
letters that say things like b2 b6 b7
see the directly telling you which party

251
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,860
the Freedom of Information Act the
specific statutes

252
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,380
are exemption so be to its internal be
sixes

253
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,060
for but it be personal private personal
privacy

254
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,449
be seventy years its criminal stuff
perhaps having to do with an informant

255
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,540
et cetera

256
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,480
wanna be other reasons that they
withhold things sometimes the right big

257
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,000
letters and/or which means
non-responsive so on others they have

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,240
these documents may

259
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,949
they white outer blacked out big areas
and call them non-responsive so some

260
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,110
requesters have gone back and said give
me all the stuff that you felt was not

261
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,870
responsive to my original request

262
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,690
but you blacked out on stuff you sent
your does it look centrist

263
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,920
so for some exemptions are questionable

264
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,360
um the fact that an agency has exempted
something doesn't actually mean they

265
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,459
were right about doing it

266
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,510
and there are some exemptions in
particular their problem areas were

267
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,850
going to highlight them

268
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,600
when it comes to the Freedom of
Information Act for whatever reason

269
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,850
bless their hearts

270
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,310
agencies inadvertently make a lot of
errors one

271
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,380
now it's not say every time he an
exemption is really a lot exemptions if

272
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,170
you file for a question is the latest
effort acted out

273
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,060
many many many probably most of those
are correct but you have to be skeptical

274
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,130
in particular when you see these three
exemptions these are places where you

275
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,750
should be particularly skeptical

276
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,140
b1 is national security information be
too is

277
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,750
internal materials and b5 is legally
privileged material for

278
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,140
I likely won't talk about privilege from
through the resident lawyer sure

279
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,380
for the for

280
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,189
the b5 is is probably the most commonly
misused exemption

281
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,270
it sometimes serves as a catch-all for
all the stuff that they don't want to

282
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,290
get out

283
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,319
but probably should under the law the
law says under the case law that that

284
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:44,050
material to be withheld under this has
to be

285
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,250
beef produce this pre decision must be
before a decision is made as the lead up

286
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,250
to some decision

287
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,740
as the real decision and has to be
deliberate has to actually weigh the

288
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,620
benefits of what's going on has to be
opinion it

289
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,930
has to be an opinion not fact if it's
factual has been released

290
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,480
if it's deliberative but its if it any
wonder though if it's not any one of

291
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,810
those things put together

292
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,829
it's theirs and commands between if
there's anything missing you have to

293
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:09,240
give it out but they often say well the
whole thing just

294
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,910
withheld so flooding stakes there and
and they don't trained very well in that

295
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,630
area

296
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,829
oh one other thing that happens is they
might withhold something in full

297
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,170
basically says we found stuff its all

298
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,760
withheld and folders nope nothing we can
do about not usually blatantly wrong

299
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,150
because there's a requirement

300
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,900
that they give out what they call all
segregate ball really small portions

301
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,740
that sounds like a terrible thing

302
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,060
up but it's basically says you have to
look at word by word sentence by

303
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,910
sentence figure out what to get out and
just hold on to the stuff that you

304
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,670
really can't give out but give it
everything else

305
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,750
when the ones that I like recently was a
request I found I got back

306
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,110
all I was asking for was a list of
documents and they said oh

307
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,240
know the titles of the documents
themselves are classified

308
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,630
for K great for okay so what can you do
when you get these exemptions

309
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,120
well you send an appeal letter you
appeal to whatever the appeals authority

310
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,439
is for that agency or not gonna teach
you how to write an appeal letter here

311
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:09,699
even Google foyer appeal for more info
but the denial letter will tell you

312
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,819
the letter you back from the agency 29
you access to the documents that'll tell

313
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:13,890
you where

314
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,199
you should send your appeal and you know
you have actually a pretty good chance

315
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,939
with an appeal you're not really gonna
get everything you ask for your gonna

316
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:20,740
get more

317
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,360
frequently so if you can just kinda
explain like this look this is where the

318
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,680
confusion seems to be no need to be an
attorney to write this it's not a scary

319
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,390
thing

320
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,800
you just write a letter for can out some
good news

321
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,900
I started doing this in 2005 under the
Bush administration i've seen a lot of

322
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,610
changes

323
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,290
now under Obama under the Bush
administration with regional ashcroft

324
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,060
essentially the order to agencies was
use for exemptions aggressively to

325
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,390
withhold material

326
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,600
under Obama and Attorney General Holder
the new the New World Order is

327
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,920
release as much as possible presume
release when in doubt

328
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,490
and release even material which
technically may be exempt that is my

329
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,920
phone or for exemption

330
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,689
if there is no foreseeable harm so
that's great news has made a big

331
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,449
difference

332
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:09,040
Philip

333
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,569
literally under the a under the previous
administration

334
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,349
the the rule was if the Justice
Department said we will defend in court

335
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,669
any agency who legitimately can use it
an exemption it was a very powerful

336
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,900
statement n

337
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,870
1 I've they think it's Obama's first
official act in office was to issue a

338
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,299
memorandum saying that's nonsense and we
will

339
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,570
we want to presume release in actually
took about a year for to kick in at the

340
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,500
agency level that too was a bad there's
a lot of inertia at the agency level

341
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,200
they're not connected with her

342
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,309
a very close court about a year later
they started actually I've heard from

343
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,200
people who make a lot request that
they've started

344
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,380
actually releasing information much more
actively now of course it's a huge

345
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,110
change its

346
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,480
it they release things that ordinarily
they put up a fight on a pair

347
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,020
okay so we have some examples withdrawn
from the people at government attic in

348
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,740
the stuff is all online you can look at
it there's a lot of things there that

349
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,040
are

350
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,740
quite interesting this is a
non-commercial website that was founded

351
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,570
in 2007 they've

352
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,189
filed numerous way requests and the
fruit to those requests are posted

353
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,570
as a the as a public service they post
documents that are unavailable anywhere

354
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,480
else

355
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,780
and they're shy people but they agreed
to be interviewed

356
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,260
the first item is and FBI confidential
room dossier between 1950 in 1972 they

357
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,290
had this room where they put sensitive
documents that were so sensitive they

358
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,668
could include them in a normal file
scheme

359
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:33,250
and the room according to the memos the
room got so heavy

360
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,309
because it's so many file cabinets that
it was threatening the building was

361
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:38,730
threatening to collapse

362
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,620
he's not joking thats in the valley in
the member you can read it online

363
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,110
and so they started to weeded out
because every once in a while had to go

364
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,390
through and pull up things that were

365
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,760
or no longer a sensitive as they were in
there was a real variety of stuff that's

366
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,679
described in this

367
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,740
in a series memos and they really serve
as a roadmap that

368
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,260
map to historically significant FBI
files that their documents that point

369
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,460
other documents

370
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,250
and it shows the tension within the FBI
which is probably too and other agencies

371
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,679
where they wanted to be able to use the
files to do investigations and there had

372
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,270
to be connected with everything else

373
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,580
but at the same time they wanted to
limit access to them so they're they're

374
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,210
pulling in different directions and that
same thing happened a few years ago over

375
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,480
last year's when they're trying to do an
electronic filing system

376
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,850
electronic document system and that's
one of the problems in

377
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,360
in wife it ultimately failed they they
gave up and they had to start over again

378
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,919
because you can sequester that you have
to sequester certain things with a

379
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,710
witness protection program details

380
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,960
but you can't sequester too much because
then you can't make any use for

381
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,660
so the interesting thing about this
dossiers they released enough material

382
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,580
their permits

383
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,020
requests for particular interest in
files that they identified by file

384
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,760
number you don't have to ask for the
name you don't ask them to do a search

385
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,320
is a

386
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,260
I want this file number and even if they
took out the name

387
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,070
these people ask for summer have asked
for some up the files by file number

388
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,760
alone

389
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,270
and the prefix tells you what sort of
I'll it is actually so one of the items

390
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,770
in here was a file on the smuggling
atomic bombs or parts thereof and other

391
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,590
weapons of mass destruction to the
United States

392
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,790
it contains highly classified
information and and

393
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,879
estimates the soviet developments in the
field together with skip suggest the

394
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,160
countermeasures basically with this file
talks about his guys taking suitcases

395
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,770
into the United States

396
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:21,020
a or small boats but but mostly
diplomatic personnel carrying in big

397
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,870
suitcases

398
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,950
with atomic bombs in them bringing them
into the country

399
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,700
and the weapons of mass destruction is
not a new term it shows up in these old

400
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,740
FBI file sixty years ago

401
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,470
the FBI also the another item posted on
government eric is the FBI's

402
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,740
high-visibility memos these were
produced

403
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,330
every time another a famous person's FBI
file was released or something

404
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,360
a a high profile FBI files released they
produced internally what's called a

405
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,600
high-visibility them on they circulated
within the FBI and

406
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,110
and notify the families have anyone that
was rude affected because they got some

407
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,419
complaints after some files were
released that someone famous

408
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,880
and these memos point to a whole bunch
of notable files they gone from

409
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,169
decades and there's hundreds a items
mentioned in a course there

410
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,760
interesting file so there another road
map to more interesting stuff

411
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,780
the web meisters asked for them after
they saw a mention of hype is files and

412
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,580
some other

413
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,918
in another document here's 1i John
Lennon

414
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,250
the book at the documents to be released
or from a security matter new left

415
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,380
investigatory file the investigation was
initiated upon receipt of information

416
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,700
that Lennon might engage in activities

417
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,230
to disrupt the 1972 Republican National
Convention

418
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,669
third time is the DOD resale activities
border view it sounds like the most

419
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,020
boring thing you can imagine but it was
established by Congress to review which

420
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,960
videos and magazines could be sold on
military bases

421
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,580
so these guys heard about this and they
requested the meeting minutes and

422
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,678
agendas

423
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,730
and the decisions they made and this is
an example of where government a free

424
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,000
speech collided

425
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,620
and government eric is published a
number of interesting documents that

426
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,760
show that collision

427
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,059
for example religious activities in
prison where prisoners are asking to

428
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,260
belong to the Church of the country or
something and and

429
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,850
these DA intersection between government
and free speech in for religions on

430
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,880
those are always really

431
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,860
interesting junctures so the Board met
six times they reviewed

432
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,380
during this period they reviewed 207 I
periodicals 59-58 films by body

433
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,330
recordings

434
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,539
and it's a tough job but somebody's
gotta do it and they did this

435
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,590
year after year for several years and
the results are on the website

436
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,860
for so that the result for

437
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,900
160 magazines no good

438
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,330
ten others were okay that the the ratio
for videos was probably about the same

439
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,129
some the titles were a things we
probably would show here

440
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,799
the interestingly enough the people at
playgirl magazine

441
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,270
the editors filed an appeal they were
the only people who ever filed an appeal

442
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,809
on a Sat playboy

443
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,230
is OK but why is our magazine ban and

444
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,320
the afford I can swear this cuz I

445
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,530
I don't remember exactly but I believe
the board turned down said no

446
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,789
but the answers on government addict
answers on government actor

447
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:09,070
the Air Force and all the military
services head

448
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,039
have hollywood offices they still do the
Army Navy Air Force Marines Coast Guard

449
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,720
they all have these

450
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,710
yellows and Nevis office in Hollywood
and their jobs to talk to all the movie

451
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,470
producers

452
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,080
all the TV producers anybody who wants
to do anything

453
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,070
that involves any military assets or
once a descriptive you don't want to

454
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,178
a cost uniform across team information

455
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,870
was any kinda been put basically if you
want to hear if you want to use an

456
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,610
aircraft carrier

457
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,260
your movie you want jets flying over if
you want to show anything

458
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,150
you really gotta talk to them to get the
help and they decide whether they want

459
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,950
to help UN if you don't

460
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,660
and they also by the way want to see the
script had a time they wanna make sure

461
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,480
anything

462
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,809
that doesn't portray the military in a
proper weight is corrected its

463
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:51,320
you know it's their prerogative they're
supplying all the toys so

464
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,260
the government at ICF ok said that there
must if they're doing this there must be

465
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,280
something that says what are these guys
on hollywood actually doing how they

466
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,840
just define their distance out there so
they must be periodic reporting

467
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,629
there must be this and that so they
asked for the periodic reporting and i

468
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,419
got all these weekly reports from

469
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,280
the Army and the Air Force that the
other services were a little more

470
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,470
reticent

471
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,669
and it really shows a window into how
DOT has influence in Hollywood for

472
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:16,230
better or worse it shows how the
military build his brand for these

473
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,140
movies and television

474
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,280
and how much activity the they are
involved in

475
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,039
hundreds and hundreds a project to cheer
for

476
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,870
so here's an example gumball 3000 the
public affairs office at Edwards Air

477
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,760
Force Base

478
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,480
referred to the pentagon a producer
whose project involve music in

479
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,669
entertainment stars going on a
cannonball like Grace Las Vegas to Los

480
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:38,580
Angeles

481
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,010
asked if they could race on the Edwards
Air Force Base runways which is the

482
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,980
longest dinner

483
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,350
in the world I believe and according to
the producer the event with the NMT be

484
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,710
made into a feature

485
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,000
the the Air Force at the Pentagon said
no

486
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,940
for there's not enough air force
involvement or the help at this time

487
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,870
plus the race plans to end at the
Playboy Mansion

488
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,539
your and there are literally hundreds of
pages on the entertainment liaison

489
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,570
office quite interesting stuff if you
book for

490
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,530
the the Federal Emergency Management
Agency keeps a set lessons learned

491
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,860
up from disasters and hurricanes
tornadoes space shuttle crashes

492
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,850
everything you can imagine these are
things were something went wrong and

493
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,590
people are trying to figure out what the
lessons learned and the

494
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,678
people at government had asked for the
copy the database and I got a printout

495
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,159
of the lessons learned

496
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,110
so one suggestion was in there said that
in support a recent hurricanes

497
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,750
CR's primary functions and up fliers the
victims if our disaster

498
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,019
victim with the without access to phone
electricity or any means to get to a

499
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:39,970
disaster center and I received the flyer

500
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,370
informing me this information I would be
inferior

501
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,470
so we looked at all the stuff on
government attic n

502
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,279
we put it in four buckets the first book
it was documents pointing to other

503
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,289
documents

504
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:58,759
is guys seem to have gotten better
records access into a spin or here

505
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,809
the the one of the big things they have
a section on for

506
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,070
way case of Freedom of Information
caseloads are basically a system

507
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,158
activity log

508
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,019
for each agency that says who asked for
what what they asked for

509
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,580
in some cases how successful a word so
list a baller

510
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,120
attempts people have made to get
different things and how people have

511
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,289
asked for things what

512
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,419
with the magic words that used and its
it's really remarkable stuff

513
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,440
for up until a few years ago no one use
this but they seem to have

514
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,799
made in habitat asking for this has
become more popular enough where

515
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,340
community understand

516
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,649
but they've asked for the conference at
the agency internet sites

517
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:37,019
the internal intranet sites and and some
agencies have so many

518
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:40,049
internal for net sites that they don't
know how many they have

519
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,470
there literally do not have a count of
how many there and

520
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,519
they what they do is they asked for
these guys ask for the home page and

521
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:46,809
then

522
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,289
all the pages connected to it by one
click and then sometimes all the pages

523
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:52,158
connected to it by two clicks

524
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,759
so they work their way down the
hierarchy and along the way they found a

525
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,779
lottttt stuff

526
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,100
and they ask for those things to in some
cases so it's a very productive it turns

527
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,100
out that ABC's post a lot a really
interesting information on the internal

528
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,789
sites

529
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:07,000
and so because it's posted it's very
easy for them to find get to and so

530
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,240
these guys seem to mind that pretty well
a inspector general's in different

531
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,110
agencies do lots and lots of
investigations that when they close them

532
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,019
the titles are available on the reports
are available these guys list for

533
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:20,610
s just asked for a list of all the
closed investigations that each agency

534
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,330
something the 'it's never made exit the
provided for

535
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,210
the ID's have a dual role they they're
supposed to watch out for bad stuff

536
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,429
going on with an agency but they're also
supposed to

537
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,629
sort watch out for the agency itself so
it's a little tough for them to promote

538
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:34,190
their

539
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,399
all the bad stuff they find about the
agency they work for but

540
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,490
if I can jump in here for second Michael
this goes to the point you made earlier

541
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,460
about

542
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,710
in the introduction that the one of the
huge

543
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,450
socially valuable roles a four-year is
to pry information out the government

544
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,220
that we should have anyway

545
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,360
but that there's no mechanism right now
for distributing

546
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,490
right so there's just no mechanism
currently for a lot of the stuff to get

547
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,039
out

548
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,269
to the citizenry and say you have to ask
for another great example

549
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:03,100
so the inspector general's they would
love to have this information out there

550
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,669
but but protocol dictates they really
can't make a point of telling people

551
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:11,000
you know how many people were looking at
that stuff on their internal computers

552
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,009
during working hours or something but
but

553
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,409
there's a lot of interesting information
so TSA had emergency amendments

554
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:20,870
a all kinds of things about restrictions
on travel and getting on airplanes and

555
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,360
and they've got this so that

556
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,850
the next categories agency
self-identified interesting documents

557
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,809
how do you find out what the interesting
stuff is a disease you tell the eight

558
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,720
you get the agency to tell you what's
there

559
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,029
so for example people if they ask these
guys are best for the list at the all

560
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,149
the still classified documents at an
agency

561
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:39,330
they go back sixty or seventy or eighty
years by the way the old is classified

562
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,399
documents by the way that I've been able
to

563
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:45,929
ascertain are about a hundred and
ten-years-old

564
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:49,159
for it's a long story but but they're
still this is over

565
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:51,779
there's still class by the Office
documents at the National Archives about

566
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:52,730
ninety four years old

567
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,889
happy with invisible ink but but so many
things just never get the class but

568
00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:00,879
a list a restricted opinions different
agencies produce all these these reports

569
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:03,690
& opinions and their restricted so these
guys asked for a list of all the

570
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,009
restricted stuff

571
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,499
reports in a city congress that were not
post online you can see an example of a

572
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,049
complex query here which

573
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:14,299
they can do and that provides access to
all the stuff they gave to Congress but

574
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,190
didn't bother to tell anybody else they
were doing

575
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,549
would let me just jump in there think
about the request letter right

576
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,220
you know gear agency please send me
copies a everything that you

577
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,860
everything all your reports to Congress
but you didn't bother to post online

578
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,850
right you would think that the answer
would be none we both did everything

579
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,090
but of course that's not the case right
min it appears that

580
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,409
for an agency to postings online they
really get the information a docking

581
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,360
attempt at an internal champion had
overcome some bureaucratic inertia I

582
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,049
don't think there's anything

583
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:45,759
evil going on here just that it takes
some effort to get these things going

584
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,019
because they produce so much material
there's a there's a little bit %uh very

585
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:50,259
over

586
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:54,220
so too are the two other categories
working behind the scenes

587
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,039
for example a asking for the contents
but the tracking number

588
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:02,080
processing files for other flee requests
let's look behind the scenes that they

589
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,230
at the activity log and see what they
actually did and you could tell well

590
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,710
you seen a request and I for it shows
where

591
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,309
agency found stuff but it technically
wasn't

592
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:15,490
they interpret a it to predict that to
say that it wasn't relevant they can

593
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,409
give it to the person but the all that
back and forth

594
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:20,860
chatter traffic is in those files and
that's sort of an interesting diagnostic

595
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,620
tool

596
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,340
and internal agency newsletters
correspondence with members of congress

597
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,700
articles from National Security Agency
technical journals going back decades

598
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,279
which are quite interesting

599
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,700
but no red 911 air defense recordings I
think that

600
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,629
vanity fair actually got those first but
these guys posted all 100 hours online

601
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,659
and agency memoranda of understanding
those are basically the

602
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:43,769
agreement for peace treaties between
agency and everybody else in the world

603
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,070
or other agencies

604
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,360
and then pop culture is just a couple
examples they asked for lists the movies

605
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,820
and books

606
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,029
on the space station and they got that
got a lot of press I understand I saw a

607
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:53,590
lot of articles about that

608
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,549
on all these people were upset that
their particular favorite movie was not

609
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,080
on there and some people were
criticizing

610
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,240
region the astronauts for their choice
of movie watching their

611
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,990
for can you know a firefly was on there
you think that would be on the space

612
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,330
station right

613
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,769
and complaints to the FCC that
particular TV shows up

614
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,659
which there's a whole section on it's
quite interesting and it turns out that

615
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,009
there's a lot of people complain about
shows

616
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,850
and how they're watching the shows that
they can't stand to watch is another

617
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,059
story but they

618
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:25,299
there's people will find complaints
about just about any TV show

619
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:28,980
bill after

620
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,350
we talked a lot we talked a lot about
documents tonight

621
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,669
and general anything for you think paper
but you should

622
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,570
database is an electronic records are
fair game under the Freedom of

623
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,999
Information Act

624
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:43,929
and there are a bunch of advantages to
asking for stuff electronically one is

625
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:46,690
even if you're just asking for like mike
was saying earlier for asking for

626
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,950
documents if they've actually process
them into a PDF or something like that

627
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,499
you know its that reproduction costs are
much lower in its then much easier to

628
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,220
share with your friends or post online
or whatever

629
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,659
but you can also request entire database
is right to the database is just really

630
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,659
a collection of records and so it's
subjective

631
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:08,889
where so and these days pretty much
anything that any agency does

632
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,909
there's a database associated with the
database may not be anything more

633
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:14,429
sophisticated than a excel spreadsheet

634
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:18,129
but it's there and you can request it
and you know an example that is a

635
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:21,850
my commission for activity log that's
really just a former database

636
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,019
filled his me one of the things that
happen sometimes and erstand from these

637
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,220
guys is that the

638
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,769
agency for a office says you can have
their database because it's a

639
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,820
proprietary software running it

640
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,499
and we can give it to you and often they
say a talk with the

641
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:38,909
agency IT person helps resolve that into
Word

642
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:42,070
downloadable format that they can look
at bright

643
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,399
and similarly if you sometimes there may
just be some fields in the database that

644
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,419
they're freaked out about

645
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,769
and so if you talk to them about white
biking to process my request so we can

646
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:51,869
give it is the author

647
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,179
but that's great I don't actually want
those fields about now I'll

648
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:58,629
well yeah I guess so there's a there's a
famous story about a state department

649
00:32:58,629 --> 00:32:59,600
database that that

650
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,519
either these guys were someone else
asked for and they said we can't it's a

651
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:02,970
in

652
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,629
in such an antiquated database system
that if we can't download it because it

653
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:09,230
would break the database

654
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:15,739
just or a true star look it up on google
it is it is a we'd never database

655
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:19,309
so here's an example this is not
government at it but this is a a foil

656
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,129
web mashup that's really kinda cool

657
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:25,269
on the I Air Force historical research
agency after a

658
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,669
which is basically the Air Force history
branch a

659
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,649
maintains a it's an internal database to
550,000

660
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:35,350
historical Air Force documents that are
sort of like you think it was like a

661
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,809
card catalog I've

662
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:40,928
Air Force documents and so some
enterprising folks

663
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,350
filed a FOIA request got the entire
database and put them on the web

664
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,720
and so you can now go to www dot Air
Force history and extort

665
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,869
and you can see this entire database

666
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:54,929
and it's really it's really quite
amazing we've heard the air force itself

667
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:57,989
uses this database rather than their own
internal version because

668
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:01,539
they can't remember the past they don't
wanna remember the password to get into

669
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,950
their own system and they require smog
in so they use this one instead

670
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:11,949
that bouquet of the interface is
probably better okay

671
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:19,308
so one of the problems that face is all
of us as for requesters is

672
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:23,040
where's the interesting stuff where the
goodies in it's a problem in two

673
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,710
different ways

674
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,240
first of his tough for us as individuals
to know where the stuff is

675
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,059
or even how to ask for if we know that
it's in there and then on top of that

676
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:33,829
the agency has no actual incentive to
tell us

677
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:37,129
rate than 100 all the good stuff is
right here

678
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:40,929
rights organization requested or what
magic words you use to retrieve it

679
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,339
so the solution like we should've been
alluding to what the government added

680
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,730
people seem to be very good at

681
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,230
is to get them to tell you by various
kind of signaling mechanisms

682
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,469
so you know the government outtake folks
seem to be submitting queries that's for

683
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,619
the agency itself to signal where it's
interesting stuff it's

684
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:01,980
so examples are identifying restricted
around published reports we mention

685
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,970
you know reports to Congress that have
been published on your website which you

686
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,730
can actually to send a follow request
saying

687
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,829
plea 7e all the restricted reports or a
list of all your restricted for the

688
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:13,299
first five pages have each restrict the
report

689
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:18,240
right to looking down at 2 p.m. the cost
you can look for a missing report

690
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,619
it great your see a web page oh here's
all the reports that we did

691
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,109
fiscal year 2009 and its report number
one

692
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:28,400
to for 5 like huh for

693
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,490
was report three have a report three
guys let's have it

694
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,660
so um you can ask for the

695
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,170
you know please send me copies of the
oldest historical record your agency

696
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,190
that is still classified um you can
focus on materials is withheld as a wave

697
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,319
signaling right when you

698
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:48,599
making request requested some broad set
of documents when you get back something

699
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,829
with a whole bunch redactions

700
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:53,200
that's what it tells you that some
important area that may be worth your

701
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,950
attention

702
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,640
if their documents which have been
released previously and have big

703
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,279
sections which are blacked out you can
go back now because the rules are very

704
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,440
different than they were under the Bush
administration

705
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,569
and their 10 till 10 to release more
much more yet this is a key point

706
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:09,680
frequently I will see even in my own
request this is another reason why the

707
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,819
FBI probably hates me

708
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:15,380
as a look at our request I filed in 2005
or 2006 I play I bet if every request

709
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,700
this or get more information

710
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,109
now so again another reason from their
perspective while the slaps the guy just

711
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:21,420
his request never and

712
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,990
I'm finally the other thing is seeking
documents

713
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,200
that identify other documents we talked
a little bit about that but you're

714
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,390
getting them to give you this

715
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,720
documents that are that are interesting
I should adhere one of the things that

716
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,010
happens is the agency for a offices are

717
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,430
inclined not really sensitive documents
but they don't mind releasing

718
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,578
interesting documents which are not
sensitive and people who request them

719
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,109
probably would prefer to get interesting
documents don't care for sensitive or

720
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,450
not

721
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,280
so there's a little bit of an overlap
with their weathers the mutual interests

722
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,369
have the foyer office

723
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,900
and the requester do merch and so that's
helped helpful room for

724
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,690
discussion and negotiation to when we
were working on this talk Michael sent

725
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,410
me an email saying how do you have an
diagram and PowerPoint okay so here's

726
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,160
some places you can go for more
information

727
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,960
on filing for requests um the National
Security Archive

728
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,220
at a sure Washington were

729
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,589
George Strait George Washington
University and its archive dork

730
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:19,470
has a great a said information both on
how to file for a question a lot of

731
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,000
examples

732
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,349
national security security-related for
work with a blog called

733
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:27,099
unredacted dot fourth are

734
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,549
there's also to web sites get my FB i
filed a common get grandpa's FBI file

735
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,279
dot com

736
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:36,329
and these will help you file a formal
request with the FBI

737
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,299
either for yourself get my FBI file or
for any deceased person they don't

738
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,680
actually have to be your grandpa

739
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,940
some people have proposed the website
get my

740
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,049
at IRS audit file that comets were

741
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:51,020
that hasn't been implemented yet but if
you're welcome to try that as an

742
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,579
experiment

743
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:55,250
um open the government or as one

744
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,400
a there is another %uh group called the
a

745
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,130
there's a informal group it is the FO
i-80 for oil

746
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,500
this survey and you can google that is
it at Syracuse University is a very

747
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,960
active mailing list lotsa

748
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,109
really good experts on there about all
manner of oil and there's an archive

749
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:13,369
which you can search which is got in 15
or 20 years old it's got thousands of

750
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:15,960
postings on any subject you can imagine

751
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,510
and it's worth exploring and then forced
government addict outworked we should

752
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,089
also mention

753
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:24,520
oj it's Michael you talk about that yes
Oj's the Office of Government

754
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,410
Information Systems services

755
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,440
and they've a they were authorized a

756
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,549
under the law cheap the legal change in
the law couple years ago

757
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:35,579
and they were just set up by the Obama
administration the bush administration

758
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,920
had funded them

759
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,319
and their job is to help for your
questions to get stuck with agencies and

760
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,359
the located at the National Credit you
go 20

761
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:46,598
if you Google ok just so GIS you'll find
a very helpful people and I understand

762
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,670
they've been remarkably helpful and
effective in

763
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,750
are fixing arm up blockades between
agency in a request during

764
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,490
in getting the requester the help they
need on some difficult to

765
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,740
conundrums okay

766
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,779
so before we take questions I'd like to
leave you with the party challenge

767
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:08,880
gonna questions the first challenge is
this I'd like you to take 30 seconds

768
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,990
sometime this weekend just 30 seconds
that's all I ask

769
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,220
think about something you've been
curious about recent news story

770
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,940
could be anything figure out what
government agency might have something

771
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,930
to do with it

772
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:25,500
guess what documents they might have and
then request them

773
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,069
do it today do it tomorrow due Monday
but do it soon because one thing ever to

774
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:30,420
vote for your is

775
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,630
although flip request may take months or
even years to

776
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,540
come back to you guaranteed if you don't
request for two weeks that's two weeks

777
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,490
longer before you're going to have this
document threats I'm constantly looking

778
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,589
back I think I wish I had requested that
way and Harry find the address to the

779
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,630
agency for the playoffs you just type in
the name of the agency

780
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,119
and then where n your shop the foyer
page for that agency in or give you the

781
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,200
address in probably an

782
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,390
email address to send in a request by
email and

783
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,230
to request one is poster experiences on
the hope for me if you do request

784
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,220
something let us know what you get back

785
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,180
and you know your mom raised you right
thank you notes were always a good idea

786
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,339
not to us but to the foyer officers
involved

787
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:09,339
they have really kind of a thankless job
it's really nice to say thanks to them

788
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:12,430
Phil Simms really nice Christmas cards
to them

789
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,970
yeah but I think I'm a sucka

790
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,550
alright questions hi

791
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:27,550
how you

792
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,980
thank you so much for the the charming
entertaining and informative talk

793
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,700
%uh it I was kinda piqued by your saying
the old is classified documents and it's

794
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,039
on like at a little story there but
after you know it's kinda curious what

795
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:45,950
they were or something like that seem
like a beacon of a little anecdote thank

796
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,200
you

797
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,609
a lot of them have to do with things
like gas masks for forces

798
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:54,940
gas masks for dogs a things along those
lines

799
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,539
so there was recently a number in SA
technical documents posted on Cryptome

800
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,680
yeah that come out before a request now
after they were posted someone

801
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,180
realize that they've needed request for
the same document number: years back

802
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,200
and it turned out their actions that you
documents were entirely different and

803
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,039
combined to give a lot more information
then either of them alone and there's

804
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,349
also a lot of interesting

805
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:22,309
information it matter what was reacted
active and wondering how often that

806
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,849
it seem that the sovereign actions have
a difference of opinion

807
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:30,690
you get more information from requests
this is actually quite common it's a

808
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,069
it's a useful thing to watch one one
story that tonight's dinner I think

809
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:36,430
there are two gentlemen in Blackpool
escort you out

810
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:41,740
I there's one interesting story someone
had requested

811
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,599
document from the justice department
about how certain program was being

812
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,980
conducted on diversity and and the
justice department's particularly retail

813
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,690
strewn about releasing they finally

814
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,829
were pressured into releasing the
portions they could release but they're

815
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:56,099
equipped they released a redacted
version which meant somebody over wrote

816
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,440
some black on the docket without taking
the underlying

817
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,460
meditate out and of course the the text
was still there someone copied and

818
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,579
pasted it was all there

819
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:06,900
and it showed how ridiculous their
reductions were in it

820
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,589
it it caused a big stir because it was
clear that they were using exemptions in

821
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,150
ways that were totally legal

822
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,980
and this was a a very prominent events
but

823
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,240
1 comment on on that specific thing that
is a that is a thing that does happen

824
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,740
night the reality is that they're human
being he just got back that first page

825
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,269
about your Google being an hour the
minicomputer versus foyer being a team

826
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:30,569
people people are processing these
documents and deciding what to redact

827
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:33,250
they're going to react different things
and so if you compare different reactor

828
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,319
documents you're potentially learn more

829
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,740
and for sitting here in D

830
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,559
when his first pass the act was first
passed in nineteen sixties

831
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,319
%uh up but it's been it was very weak at
the time

832
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,869
and I think 67 and it was 66 and it was
strengthened in 1974

833
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:56,519
it's funny because it was strengthened
by people who weren't necessarily favor

834
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,849
that they made it stronger so would be
killed

835
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:02,519
as an amendment and I got past anyway so
it getting stronger and

836
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,180
actually what happened to the into the
bush administration was they passed an

837
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,279
executive order which

838
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:11,309
which helped requesters to try to fend
off an improvement to the Freedom of

839
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:12,230
Information Act

840
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,940
and it has the freedom Ave Information
Act improvement as well see at both

841
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,509
so that the end of the Bush
administration that was a big push that

842
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:22,970
actually helps but the Obama memo was
more effective in making changes

843
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,759
and as he leaves the behavior that told
it and

844
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:29,890
answering in either UK comment on what
he thought the

845
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,029
future have the system was it seems
really

846
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:36,160
and say counter-intuitive pay people to

847
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,440
and reach create anything a than that
build the database

848
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,970
Osher and that to me

849
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,339
his fat ended it complicit in this

850
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,509
so it a big question right on n I do
think one thing is

851
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:53,980
as information becomes increasingly
digital I mean they keep promising us

852
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,140
the paperless office

853
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,160
right fed um it becomes harder and
harder to justify any sort over 30 years

854
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,038
or whatever

855
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,920
at and so I think you're gonna see those
tend to go away and that's going to

856
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,170
result in a lot more

857
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,869
open a somewhat more information being
released at the same time

858
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:13,740
there is a problem right there is a
there is a something's actually I

859
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,410
believe

860
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,700
country to some people here I'm sure in
this room there are some things that are

861
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,680
legitimately secret

862
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,730
and that the government may not want to
release a may have good reasons for not

863
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,049
wanting to religion so

864
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:27,288
how you deal with this I don't think
we've we as a society or

865
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,559
or they as a government have figured
that out yet I think it's gonna get

866
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,279
better but

867
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:36,250
something new able at times I said again

868
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,079
but through that

869
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,259
the theory is released 21 released all
if they release the one person that goes

870
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:44,940
everybody

871
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,700
benso but in some ways rate from their
perspective will look for

872
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,690
here here's some document that we have
we couldn't spend time putting us on the

873
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,680
web for whatever

874
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,200
right Picasa certain amount of money
some fraction send two dollars or

875
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,079
whatever to do that

876
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,739
if instead we let you ask for them we
know it's actually now important for now

877
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:02,789
will spend the time

878
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:07,640
so that's very true what he say for

879
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,940
for this thing fisting

880
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,650
ever requested information on how much
people you keep employed

881
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,890
and how many manpower has been flowing
to your requests that would be

882
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,890
interesting I

883
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:26,060
I'm I I'd really rather not know that
I'm not going to request the head

884
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:30,160
we didn't ask the government at people
that question as I got here the late so

885
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,700
I may not

886
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,760
had got the Spartans beat but if you
have a security clearance

887
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,170
you were cleared by someone and there
was a process that they want you back on

888
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:38,870
such so

889
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,240
can you for your request your own
background check

890
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,580
your yes certainly there's a what is the
logic behind that if that's a good idea

891
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,670
its it's not only if where there is
built into the law that you can request

892
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,770
records about yourself it's called the
Privacy Act easy when you're requesting

893
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,900
records about yourself you get more than
a few requesting about other people and

894
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,450
and

895
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,790
the background security check that's
something that is is written in that

896
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,560
you're allowed to get a copy that went

897
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,450
at the conclusion of the security
clearance for thank you very much for

898
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:08,450
his question with you where

899
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,330
agency request when you're trying to
find information about yourself

900
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,600
and also do you think politicians are
changing the ways on that they're

901
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,580
keeping information to hide it so it
doesn't want to be said

902
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,650
and to these apartments and is
eventually found the you guys there's a

903
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,560
lot of the

904
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,240
well we didn't do this so we're not
gonna take credit for that but there are

905
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,560
a lot of agencies that have the key
personal information and there's

906
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,250
something if you

907
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,610
for if you google the term Privacy Act
compilations each agency is supposed to

908
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:35,480
provide owner

909
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,310
annual except for biannual basis a list
of all the data sets that they have they

910
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,910
have personal information actually the
huge list and is what agencies that are

911
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:43,960
involved in a few

912
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,740
find those agencies and up and look up
there for the office you can add you can

913
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,870
ask for the record the request under the

914
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:54,170
where for your privacy act I might have
missed this set to

915
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:58,320
but on disinformation to be released in
trying to protect reform

916
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,840
that's happening much more often now
it's much more often that you see this

917
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,020
stuff released you can tell from the
files that are put on line sometimes

918
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,540
there

919
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,500
there had texted in ways that make it
clear they were released in some other

920
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,120
and some electronic form and the
agencies are

921
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,040
moving more toward up the specialized
processing systems that allow them to

922
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,330
help with the stuff electronically it
saves a lot of paper and

923
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:22,580
photocopying one comment on that is
every agency is a little bit different

924
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,259
for forever because every agency has its
own flair processes and

925
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,540
and give people who do it in the butt
different IT equipment and everything

926
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,220
else so

927
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,510
one agency may give you the entry is
another agency me very very good about

928
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:34,160
emailing

929
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,940
phil was once told that he couldn't get
a paper copy of a record had to get it

930
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:43,200
dick digital copy because their
photocopier was broken the FBI I'm sorry

931
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,680
the FBI photocopier

932
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,020
3 true story we we've been saying agency
over and over again

933
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,860
%uh is that correct that foyer only
applies to executive agencies

934
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,000
so not the legislative or judicial
branches yes there's

935
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,530
it applies to the executive branch
agencies in the federal government the

936
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,490
some other states have

937
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,170
all the states have analogous laws but
some other weaker summer stronger

938
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,320
typically of ways uses a catch-all term
or it sometimes they say Freedom of

939
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,390
Information Law but

940
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,770
each state has some law about that if
you want to run down all the different

941
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,150
states and one loss they have its

942
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:19,280
it's a treat RC FP reporters Committee
for freedom of the press has a what

943
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,530
has a page called a the

944
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,900
the something about tapping if tapping
offical secrets or something like that

945
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,300
and it talks but each state

946
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,710
but the arm there's about seventy
agencies

947
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,740
and a number of components within each
agency that halfway offices there's

948
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,550
probably about

949
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:42,200
I'd say about three or four hundred
forty officers and the government for

950
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,230
do you think there's any credence to the
fear that if you make a

951
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,450
for a request you may actually be
drawing attention to yourself

952
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:53,930
that seems to be the reason people give
to me when I

953
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:58,540
encourage them to make for a request is
the if they don't have any documents on

954
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,360
me then

955
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,130
now they're gonna be interested
wondering why I believe that's entirely

956
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:09,210
folklore its totally untrue how much is
a pic 7 that except for you

957
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,870
yeah

958
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:14,350
it that's a tough one there right
because it's proving a negative so

959
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:19,790
but I i agree with Michael typically the
operational aspects of an agency are

960
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,009
quite separate from the foyer

961
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:26,940
aspects of the agency so I think you can
be reassured on that point thank you

962
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:33,940
very much

963
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,220
for you aren't we doing so schlesinger

964
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,370
engineering and here overflow is back
and bill

965
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:49,180
we're starting so sanitary or less on
time the Telephone Pioneers

966
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,520
are going to go after social engineering
back there okay

967
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,580
hang out this better for
