1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,089
down in the box period every person
couldn't break

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:09,000
the literacy rate was like 1 percent
alright

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,690
later I'm naked guber change that by one
future

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,879
the average book before gutenberg

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,970
cost as much as the average family farm
the could feed the house the whole

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,720
family for generation after generation
after generation that was the price of a

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,180
book

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,198
you have a higher wanna the

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,630
you'll eat readers and writers ascribe a
stationary or a monk or whatever

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,270
and pram a whole year salary to get
something

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,770
but looks like whereby who burgers

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,070
looks like this now before you actually
stormy to steal this

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,010
this is a reproduction but even though
it's a reproduction

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,108
would cost over million dollars to make
it King James Bible

15
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,059
liked to this is made exactly the same
way they could

16
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,040
and you don't have health fair how many
pages

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,950
in this of course doesn't have nearly as
many words is your Bible has 0 it

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,549
it it saw bike to work however

19
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,189
the Gutenberg press was V

20
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,909
very first mass production machine

21
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,210
world gutenberg it is two guys

22
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,530
who just handed in the paper stacked up
could make

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,710
more on these in one day that a home
monastery could turn out really here

24
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,280

all the time when defining where the

32
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,759
book is about

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,060
anyone cares anymore so we'll skip over
that who can make

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,099
are we don't bother with torrents for
individual books cuz there you know

identify with too many huge files in

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,560

99
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,300

book fair .org site has

102
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,740
some stuff on that server but mostly
points out everywhere else the servers

103
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,590
we don't have a central flexion

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,370
for the three and three-quarter million
we have several flexion for the main

105
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,400

110
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,660
okay this stuff I talked about the cost

111
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,660
I've keeping a whole library in your
pocket like that

112
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,770
I'm sure somebody in here got 10 the IBM
memory keys did anybody get one of those

113
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,870
eight make IBM memory keys back in

2000 I so want to get 1 I'll stop pay
for it

115
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,350
nobody out early adopters we were not
okay

116
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,630
but those days were 50 or 60 bucks

117
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,080
in a car to go to Walmart right now in
for 20 bucks and get a 16k

118
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,919
and for 40 bucks you can get sorry for

119
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,370
20 much you make a and for forty what
you get a 16 gig

120
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,780
and it's just it just keeps going like
said

121
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,169
I got the 64 gig your for a hundred
bucks

122
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,210
a couple years ago something's wrong
with price /url

123
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,580
I think it was supposed to be a hundred
pounds and state

124
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,919
bikers the price still looks wrong from
Mike

125
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,630
but fact is you carry all this stuff
around your neck every book ever want

126
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,780
saw were gonna get too terrified to this
stuff no doubt

127
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,880
all toppling you want to talk what cokie

128
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,030
I wouldn't mind if people will help me
with this copyright

129
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,520
wanna say our last copyright law got
passed in 1998

130
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,219
known Versailles France lia's the sonny
bono Mickey Mouse

131
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,360
copyright and they make it really simple

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,050
and they do it with a smokescreen they
do say we're gonna change one word

133
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,410
and that one word is the number I've
years okay

134
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:05,580
overnight change in law which in one
word and they do it with a voice vote

135
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,008
behind closed doors in this last one
they did it

136
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,020
in the same 24 hours as they impeach
President Clinton

137
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,259
1990 1998 so what's up

138
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,889
I was supposed to go testify Italian
find out they have other stuff happens a

139
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:23,639
week so it's already been done

140
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,160
okay I would like to create some kind of
movement

141
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,039
to publicize the fact that they're going
to do this again

142
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,549
because we are now 58 so the way done
with the period that extension

143
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,859
that's all twelve and a half years ago
alright and these things are twenty

144
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,729
years

145
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,860
so they're going to have to start
introducing new copyright

146
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,839
bills five years let's give the details
briefly because its side

147
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,519
2019 is going to be the end of the
20-year extension that happens in

148
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
in 1998 and what that means if that
happens

149
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,920
is that and then many viewers even porn
and it was the meeting

150
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,099
is that the public to me will start to
grow again in 1999 suddenly

151
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,870
we weren't getting a new year that enter
the public domain exit copyright entered

152
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,510
the public domain every year as we had
been

153
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,040
soviet schedule stuff from 1922 1923
1924 that we're gonna release

154
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,880
and he stopped after 1922 because of
this extension

155
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,630
2019 just a few years away we're out
wherever

156
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,689
firmly anticipating another session at
against you

157
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,019
implemented further extension and think
about this without going into a huge

158
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:28,760
detail

159
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,800
is there's very tiny amount of stuff
from like 1923 and analed afterwards

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,140
that makes a ton of money for companies
like Disney and Anya

161
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,939
2 percent and stuff like that to produce
this is most the content from those days

162
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,890
totally out of

163
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,920
you know how to print not make anybody
any money and i no one would mind for in

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,849
the public domain

165
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,970
so analyze unfortunately are protecting
that ghastly tiny

166
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,399
some meanwhile millions and millions I
am that we have forcing everyone else

167
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,490
about to give way

168
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,029
are basically locked up to rent is paid
this gonna happen in our 2019

169
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,130
behind closed doors faster than you
could believe it I'm

170
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,170
less we start lining up fee I

171
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,550
you know the counter strike and have the
across the public domain be a major

172
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,380
effort

173
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,700
working with like research elder and
archived and some other folks try to you

174
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,709
I try to make this a real issues have
people and ideas about that

175
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,320
Senate's no get in touch talk to us we
think it's we think it's

176
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,200
that the fact is a a sneaky last time
and we think maybe it's our turn to be

177
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,279
sneak into something preemptive

178
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,010
up well for them

179
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:41,010
now the standard alterna to turn up

180
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,329
needle in a haystack house 15

181
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,680
the particular book we want I was having
trouble finding a book with just the

182
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,750
other night and

183
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,740
cooling googling googling and I could
never get there from here

184
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,149
so I was one could address that weighs
no

185
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,250
project gutenberg: has several different
search engines built in that good mood

186
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,540
or

187
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,230
and I use them half the time when I just
put Google with the project gutenberg:

188
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,820
in quotes around it

189
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,209
is and because I have Google is one way
is the drop downs

190
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,519
don't have good burgers like I do but
Google's always on

191
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,620
Bergesen

192
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,290
but i just i project gutenberg: or
Internet Archive or whichever I think

193
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,829
has the collection

194
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,279
and then I say will what every author
title this keyword

195
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,689
at work now I have to bed I took

196
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,740
courses in search engines so but if you
learn the interviewers in knots and keep

197
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,660
these words out and stuff like that

198
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,439
a I i don't have any trouble we are
advanced search page

199
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,579
I'll do it for you alright this book

200
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,829
are you can search page ladue whoever's
on the ice after colliding for

201
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:51,560
everything but when they're subject can
search by subject author title

202
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,630
haha and your language stuff like that
format

203
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,740
York's we have different file formats
and different

204
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,230
down on things like a so we try but
where your bottom line is would be a

205
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,389
good burger is really more about the
creation and distribution the books

206
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:08,600
we're not trying to solve the search
problems

207
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,560
you know in an innovative way hopefully
some people are working on that that

208
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:11,930
part

209
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,110
make this %uh fidel I wrote hundreds of
apologies

210
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,040
before we ever got to 10,000 books they
I've got a cam longer

211
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,189
and while it looks easy now you're gonna
shoot me later

212
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,339
she decided not to list the so you can
find but I just I'm not a canon lawyer

213
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,920
some Goa still alternatively as long as
the net it is opened

214
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,420
arm mean if you're talking about
browsing so many books not just

215
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,880
finding a particular book I'm
recommendation engines

216
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,029
work ridiculously well now it is cell
you

217
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,920
as long as you have been edited out
there on you know people build their own

218
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,450
sites around it saying hey read this
book to read that book

219
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,760
com is a couple that out there already
but they don't

220
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,839
differentiate between arm freely
available or not sell

221
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,800
name right but then a if you do a 10
searches like I did with the project

222
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,360
Birmingham you also get 10,000 units

223
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,579
you'll find but how many gateways are
down you'll find

224
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,740
in court you can do it defining find out
if somebody changed one comment to a

225
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,820
summer calling

226
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,329
or anything like that okay now I did the
song chart

227
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:20,540
so we can talk about copyright current
copyright do we have is ninety five

228
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,889
years

229
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,610
as I broke it down in the 9.5 year
increments

230
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,519
which is $10 increments now I don't know
how you guys all know

231
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,820
movie from this conference but you may
not know that he is a PhD in library and

232
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,529
information science

233
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,930
and does all this stuff that

234
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,459
we r doubling the amount of information
we have

235
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:46,110
way faster than 9.5 years

236
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,510
there's peter lyman at berkeley says
we're doing in less than two years

237
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,680
I B very conservative to use a number
9.5

238
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,570
in also just happens to travel very
nicely with 95

239
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,940
now 10 dublin's for those who know how
to do that

240
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,070
is 24 8 16 32 64 128

241
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,230
256 512 1024 you know so it didn't look

242
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,449
if means if you

243
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:16,079
made a deal with the devil right now

244
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,029
who said I wanna new copyright law the
ninety five years

245
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,949
and in return I will put everything in
the public domain

246
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:30,529
right now you don't want to take

247
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,209
because in ninety five years only one

248
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:37,269
book outta 1,024

249
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:40,620
will be in the public domain course

250
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,829
does you can pay additional we r made
that deal and we're screwed

251
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:48,690
way worse than that and they're gonna
make it longer than 95 years

252
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,709
the basic idea is that copyright is now

253
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,860
permit in the United States

254
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,959
nothing's ever going to expire and you
could look up

255
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,959
a Supreme Court case called Eldred
versus ashcroft

256
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,350
which at one time was hard versus reno
we don't know anybody named heart not

257
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,350
deny it if you say that it was me

258
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,790
it okay sup this is how

259
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,730
fast the public domain disappears under
our current law

260
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,089
you take a five year old kid to

261
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:28,149
the line came when it came out in life
he has a 95 your copyright

262
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:31,380
naked under this law if it's never
extended

263
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,839
never renewed has to be one

264
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,130
100 years all

265
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,570
before they can be published on the

266
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,610
I myself was forced to go see

267
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,279
gone with the wind and saw the South

268
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,839
when I was in grade school because back
in those days we studied something

269
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,790
called

270
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,329
slavery not studied or

271
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,329
the week at big sections a school of
slavery and these were the two big

272
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,570
movies that expected slavery and we were
forced to go off when I would love

273
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,380
and I wanted to them then I'm planning
on of when that copyright expires

274
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,720
I wanna write articles on what I just
saw

275
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,139
and use pieces at these things back and
forth and

276
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:22,670
at Dolce days it was all going to expire
in 56 years

277
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,199
28 years old was arena and again nobody
can

278
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,680
back this up out all the books or ever
copyrighted

279
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,529
ninety-two percent of award never
renewed

280
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,990
now one above most recent things that
happened in the CAF extension before

281
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,170
this one

282
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,410
was that they've made renewal automatic
1976

283
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,699
1973 actual okay 1976 was the extension

284
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:52,449
but they actually did before I thought
was in the same want to close off

285
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:55,610
close enough for military work but yeah

286
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,579
they made it even though nobody ever
renewed it was a subtle form with a

287
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,980
nominal fee

288
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,799
you to send it in with your 20 bucks or
whatever and you've got

289
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,030
twenty eight more years of getting a
million dollars of a gone with the wind

290
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,428
the trouble with Malia's is that now

291
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:15,600
we don't get any up they

292
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,709
they don't shots want to make another
couple percent

293
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,839
as he brought up only a very small
fraction a/b this stuff is making any

294
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,409
money after nine five years

295
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,840
or seventy-five years or twenty-eight
years

296
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,850
the average copyright his out of print
in five

297
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,949
in the library and can't tell you that
if a book its toll on this morn five

298
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,049
years all the Angeles a 50-50 they can
get a replace

299
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,230
if got got a goal hope to the use

300
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,960
and yet it's copyrighted and Scott so we
can dish it out but

301
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,070
cokie the their goal for this is not
just to make two percent more of a gone

302
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,439
with the wind

303
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,059
its summer but censorship his age as
make no

304
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,360
you can't go on by is the song itself

305
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,480
so i cant even go I want to show it to
my friends cycle Australia

306
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,590
it okay saw

307
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,139
and I don't Anna times on the whole
history copyright

308
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,690
but one of them biggest parts have got
right has been censorship

309
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,120
that's why was a bit in the first place
P just as you have an

310
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,030
and was a very weak Queen at the end of
the whole thing that went from henry the

311
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,220
fourth following up to henry the eighth

312
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,220
and the interregnum and cromwell

313
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,860
and Elizabeth and all that stuff is very
clean Scots in the King James

314
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,049
King James Bible right that guy son of
Mary Queen of Scots

315
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:44,639
huge upheavals not love them would okay
the copyright law

316
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,200
they all knew this was a bad day

317
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,110
but the stationers is right calf
lobbying your fufu of you for

318
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,160
250 years and I finally got cleaning

319
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,490
just really belong there anyway and the
guys did mister

320
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,840
all their writing templates bad-mouthing
you they're gonna take over

321
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,889
revolution you gotta stop home so
overnight

322
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,080
the number of books imprint in Britain

323
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,870
went from 6,000 to 600

324
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,230
it's been that way ever since now i cant
really go into the rough time

325
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:27,230
what time well we need one a lifetime
questions we got his max 20 fine ass

326
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,330
okay on SW you don't like that sorry I
love this I don't know what I'm

327
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,580
history copyright is great stuff and
then history in a nutshell is at their

328
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,270
people let alone the content that have a
vested interest

329
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,049
in making professional monopoly over the
content

330
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,309
and yes and and where we don't are you
without all that much

331
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,840
we want to say is what about all the
content that no one has a vested

332
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,870
interest in

333
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,250
can that be in the public domain which
means available to everybody for any

334
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,240
purpose

335
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,210
and yeah there's a whole said a reason
behind that this is basically a product

336
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,320
of culture

337
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,780
and eventually to go back to the culture
that on it and funny thing is read the

338
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,360
US Constitution is right there

339
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,500
yes it's a it says for a temporary time
are going to have a monopoly

340
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,140
limit I'm gonna have a monopoly to the
ER content producers

341
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,030
arm temporarily that's our report has
now ruled that limited

342
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,649
means it every night him in every way i
jus

343
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,990
any number you may choose yes still a
diverse community like they want

344
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,909
as for that poor decision all members
and drop which is why me to take my name

345
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:34,090
off

346
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,720
you know I'm going to that but I'll tell
you the I mean day with a losing 5-4

347
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,299
loss 722

348
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,918
and that's when the real estate just
copyright law anymore

349
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:45,960
of story short shelf we're going
backwards now

350
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,299
I clicked on way apologize I I
definitely I cannot see their rates lies

351
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,309
before me like I usually can decide to

352
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:55,590
Falcons alright by now

353
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,020
people are always asking me month next
this is my what's next

354
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,490
a billion book life

355
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,980
now is any good library information
sciences can tell you

356
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,610
there are about 25 million books in the
public domain

357
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,960
if we do forty percent of have

358
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,480
thats 10 million does any good linguists
can tell you

359
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,190
there are 250 languages with over one
million speakers

360
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,460
if you do forty percent follows we get a
hundred languages

361
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,080
if you take $10 million books and put
them into one hundred languages

362
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,470
you get up billion books

363
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,610
this is going to happen not a question
whether it's going after

364
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,530
it just went I have made someone who was
a trying to get all the translators ago

365
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,879
some like this but of course they all
want to get paid for and i won

366
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,159
for free so we are knocking heads there

367
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,320
but here are several handfuls a ways
that you can create

368
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,600
affiliate Box you can just 24 million
books and get all 250 languages

369
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,700
big use the volunteers in all these
languages

370
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,929
I want free books I can read that line
which I can type in this language

371
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,280
both and there's also machine
translation

372
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,100
personally I think that machine
translation

373
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,490
is one of the really next be things

374
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,280
outbreak should the sometimes it still
comes out how do you remember the

375
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,190
original

376
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,700
machine translation thing where you
translated from English to Russian it

377
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,440
back

378
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,780
he started out with the spirit is

379
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,780
willing but the flesh is weak and you
came back with the vodka strong with the

380
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,190
meat is right

381
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,520
not it makes sense spirits

382
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,879
are of the hall and

383
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,659
Fleisch is me

384
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,780
right the flash is me flash flash if you
don't love languages

385
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,658
sadly I do it if they say to speak
perfectly good sense

386
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:07,650
the computer system I can do that spirit
spirit is strong

387
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,470
bikers water okay

388
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,870
but it's getting better and better and I
know how many people have you do this

389
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,120
but I constantly cut and paste things
from

390
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,570
different languages or vice versa people
call me up and say

391
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,399
I got this quotation this language can
you give it to you language

392
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,470
up under a row with it I figure out what
to do with your own

393
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,159
I love doing it's a lot of fun alright

394
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,370
I'll did that

395
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,340
that's why by one of my models there at
apartment dalian

396
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,730

at we do all everyone that somebody can
find that we can get some

411
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,850
do dan Brown this was like the biggest
seller for five years outsold the Harry

412
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,320
Potter guys

413
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,500
and he wrote this very few people know
to us

414
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,000
that said for their generous assistance
the research for this book

415
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,370
I would like two dollars the Louvre
Museum the freshkills Ministry of

416
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,260
Culture

417
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,210
project gutenberg: the bill detector see
now fantastic society Library department

418
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,490
of paintings and blah blah blah blah
blah

419
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,700
why because we have more bibles

420
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,350
he could look up stuff and just like
that anybody on the planet

421
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,299
and we keep putting in more there was a
guy right behind you

422
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:29,720
yeah the main thing there is is just
super fights we don't we don't try to be

423
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,850
have the authoritative

424
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,230
best single scholarly and you'll have a
la yeah I mean if we get that great but

425
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,250
but will take

426
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:42,700
other editions as well so far we have
you know

427
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,620
oh yes so this situation we've got to do
a rabbi ball

428
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,190
a and the group project gutenberg: to
you might want to consult

429
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,690
who just does that kind of stuff yes
good question actually about the

430
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,200
Adderall traditions that comes up a lot
and I if you look at the

431
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,980
got some good copyright how to we advise
I something about renewal so we also

432
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,710
something about reprints

433
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,900
and the basic thing is and then we r I'd
personally Lisa not a happy with

434
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,669
companies like Barnes and Noble

435
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:14,010
that take for example I Jane Austen and
put a new cover on it

436
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,440
and put copyright in front the book and
then sell for twelve dollars we give

437
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,230
that one way of course right weicker's
in the public domain

438
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,590
to they have to say and from the book is
in the public domain they denied

439
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,890
do you know when you buy it is in the
public domain you do not

440
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,240
so there are a lot of additions in all
their stuff which have been reprinted

441
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,350
and the only thing is eligible for new
copyright is something that's that's

442
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,100
essentially you active authorship

443
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,740
right copyright is a beer result of
authorship this I result of packaging

444
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,679
something up

445
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,980
not a result typing again we have this
knows where the brow out to all those

446
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,990
people are

447
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,929
claiming that they marked up a book and
therefore the book is no longer the

448
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:48,950
public man doesn't doesn't work that way

449
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,210
so you know lawyers our lawyers who want
to help the sioux these guys

450
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,960
I personally think that this is misuse
of copyright

451
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,470
nobody ever Susan the body from issues
of God when I'm at Alder Creek your fart

452
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,419
than I am now

453
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:07,120
useless for anything else I want to go
to court nail these guys

454
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,690
to put this cover on and say all rights
reserved

455
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:17,690
right I person if this is a cock yes

456
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,450
only juice of the desert fox

457
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:33,610
script

458
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:40,610
d sir

459
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,270
I we saw this actually so says 50 is a
service we can upload things that are

460
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,690
hopeful in the public domain or at least
not thing that are in print and a and

461
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,450
make them available

462
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,110
I think the it's it's interesting
because charging access for something

463
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,680
that they did known in the first place

464
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,040
is is that sounds a little questionable
arm we have you know we've course that

465
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,110
people have one charge

466
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,570
the up three dollars to make a copy or
DVD in mail anywhere in the world that's

467
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,179
one thing

468
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,490
you know having a for free subscription
services problem what we

469
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,310
some pretty good but we tried the
activist we also try to do the odd

470
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,760
why the main focuses on this this
literary historic works

471
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,430
between us and our partners were always
happy to take a collection

472
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:31,130
have anything and post it and make it
available you know Justin just say

473
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:31,690
here's a

474
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,050
you know here's a site the guy harnesses
far as we know there's nothing on Flickr

475
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,840
is available and and and here it is

476
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,450
is so kind enough to send me an email
all

477
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,410
like love to talk to these guys who we
can do yes sometimes it's understandably

478
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,280
there is that you know there's there's a
lot of misinformation about copyright

479
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,700
and some people think that

480
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,190
that it is an active authorship if you
grass meets gmail around a %ah book and

481
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,680
that makes

482
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,260
no longer public domain are you reset it
you know any new typeface or something

483
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,650
like that but it's just not

484
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,170
and we have a whole FAQ on this summer
totally authority to minus we got a idea

485
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,690
very very detailed legal review in in
the US

486
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,850
different countries have different laws
and sometimes there's an education

487
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,770
process and that actually can be a

488
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,990
can be our takes but I don't know if
these two guys we can certainly try

489
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:20,110
yeah you're going to Mikes goods are to
repeat the questions in now

490
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,180
note no detail so I don't know if anyone
asks your stride

491
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,230
reading the books on a laptop or
something on but it's not

492
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,400
easy and manage sISTAR stir hurt my eyes
after a while

493
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,710
I have noticed one thinks about action
like real books

494
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,760
is the the I mean it's a physical thing
that the lights different

495
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,060
I I think some the e-readers have tried
to solve this

496
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,520
what like the Kindle and whatever on
sony has

497
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,570
I but they're also not open and

498
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,990
you can't necessarily put wanna project
gutenberg: PDF's on to it

499
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:59,240
well sometime I can gas often you can
but issue your challenge is definitely a

500
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,080
challenge and we

501
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,159
you note so we don't mind people praying
right i mean i mean if if you want to

502
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,190
bring you can always print

503
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,750
and I getting a nice print out my cake a
little bit effort from

504
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,260
like plain text but from HTML Senge
those wondering what your

505
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,270
recommendations

506
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,830
try other formats try other screen
refresh rates try different colors for

507
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,610
different contrast try different funds
for different margins

508
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,450
certainly enough I got I've written
about this I

509
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,920
I do you haven't done your homework his
wife

510
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,750
well the devices or eliminate your
observations in different ways

511
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,930
stuff to put a book on a spree you
haven't tried half

512
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:39,880
and you'll find by the way of fun

513
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,180
of there are some iPhone really cute
little things you can do

514
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:50,490
I'll I guess when it's wired up this
week and do it

515
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,550
were tied to this %uh there we go you
worried that way

516
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,149
yeah alright all I did

517
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,590
was %uh Control Alt in a row alright

518
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,700
you get

519
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,510
whichever way you wanna read it so if
you wanna hold it this way

520
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,990
now the send me an email well

521
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,080
I will help you figure out so many
different ways reading a book and make

522
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,629
your head spin

523
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,030
we actually worked without with Apple
little bit to help them to free their

524
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,170
devices and I think that the market
forces with these different devices

525
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,240
yikes in Sony

526
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,060
you your Kindle and so forth I and
mobile devices five billion that we

527
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,520
mention that people are reading their

528
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,470
books on all around the world as much in
the US we have laptop the biggest

529
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,380
wireless but other places you see a lot
more the cell phone use

530
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,800
arm he's on proving a market forces will
will I will have some competition

531
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,000
and so we end up with is some really
great leaders like some the app's on the

532
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,620
iPhone

533
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,240
that have all these features and Henry
PDF and display a reasonable tax

534
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,470
display reasonable HTML and they don't
die enforce the RM if there's no

535
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,710
no reason to have dr. and they don't
have the are answered by default could

536
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,390
do right now with a lock of

537
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,000
we can do I think it's this screens will
still be screened sand paper also be

538
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,429
paper but I think at least the ability
to do different sizes fine scholars

539
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:07,240
orientation

540
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,890
also the yard look and feel on the
Kindle which is a unique

541
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:14,040
look and feel eventually will have on
something like paper

542
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,790
prime like classic family will have
things are like paper that are also a i

543
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,730
computer display

544
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,030
to try to be patient if you notice miles
computers defaulted white or black

545
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,740
as you can read hours longer as a
flicker

546
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,390
body trial his various colors if you
dislike sick too by the way

547
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,570
various shades of green and blue for
letters this was to be amazing

548
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,760
slightly if I'm I'm particularly
interested in

549
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,060
your thoughts on complacent consumer
zombies

550
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,870
consumers on these a you know we are you
talking about

551
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,060
how I cope were yet we're all becoming
kind of passive consumers

552
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,960
what what are your thoughts on how to
reactivate ourselves and

553
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,290
did our culture had to be rebooted to
said many

554
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,389
that's how to be an active consumer got
images says requests

555
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,620
I keep whole list some stuff and when we
get a really big your send me a note

556
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,140
saying hey I'd like to type in a page A
Preferred pager

557
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,160

really easy to be active with some light

558

567
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,230
I'm I'm sorry I meant miss I got in a
little late but his early work

568
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,960
going on time these books and even if
you with a small library of Congress

569
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,900
cataloging

570
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,340
we will see SH are but we don't have
because it there's a human in the loop

571
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,160
to do yes

572
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,780
because can you copy cat lying console
million our dishes are orders we can't

573
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,870
do it automated

574
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:09,129
and our catalog or so retired so we we
don't have quite as much by about half

575
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:11,918
it with I'll see as a shock catalog

576
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,770
codes we also have an XML RTF file if
you want to import the entire

577
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,139
everything you know author title subject
and for that we use Dublin Core

578
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,629
offer ok yes we're we're we're pretty
well good with the standard for the

579
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:24,600
human effort

580
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,109
cited in the cataloging were not nearly
100 percent at

581
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,460
I was wondering if there is any motion
to our

582
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,550
called direct publishing to he text
format

583
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,990
bikes a magazine's being replaced by he
pubs files

584
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,389
transmitted by the Internet is having on
my going on in that department

585
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:46,030
whole life yeah we are you know it's
good burger one thing I mean so we're so

586
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,070
happy that that some leaders you book
ideas michael had raided mentor the book

587
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,550
1971 right here

588
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,649
so so so Michael yeah

589
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:58,859
had this thought which didn't fight 380
ARPANET sure predated the internet and

590
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,150
and you know who will ya

591
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,680
when is 85 mosaic and and %ah I even the
FTP standard wasn't %uh Standard & are

592
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,379
using TCP IP

593
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,890
raise appreciated all the stuff and in
the last 34 years we've had a whole huge

594
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,490
pile a different eBook readers companies

595
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,500
i digital publishing all that stuff and
arm

596
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,750
so this is a you know future that's
really coming along pretty ya

597
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,220
opry nicely so we're I think we're were
are matters as a question actually means

598
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,140
they were worse actually

599
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,430
urging all that stuff and we we believe
that there's

600
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,399
arm room for all kinds cooks in the
kitchen of has different furs we got

601
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,780
nothing against commercialization other
get self publishing some like a

602
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,180
on the master forgetting on the main
good burger at work site where mostly

603
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,990
focus on the old

604
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,900
lurcher is his bottom line there but
it's the word out we're not trying to

605
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,700
limit ourselves just so we know that for
self-publishing for example

606
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,670
Ali you'll impress a place like that can
do it a little better than the problem

607
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,580
I'll sell it to other

608
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,410
if you send it to your house and
somebody totaling courage in but it's

609
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,330
not quite what we've necessarily do

610
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:00,390
are you don't hands-on way

611
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,540
I want to address what this guy said
hear about us

612
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,920
becoming passive consumers armies but a
question

613
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,630
gonna have you know do remember when
eisenhower talk about the

614
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,420
military-industrial complex

615
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,390
military-industrial Correctional Complex
said they censor

616
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,509
well what we've got now is the corporate

617
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,089
government congressional contacts so
lonely and were being made

618
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:25,230
passes tumors on his fight design

619
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,560
yes and legislation we're not simply
becoming

620
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,120
that passively out one coming I meant to
get in before when someone is talking

621
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,410
about people who

622
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,480
bought up copyrights and make money when
they were extended

623
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,890
10 Turner bought ted turner TNT

624
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,520
are bought up the MGM movie library

625
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,630
when all the copyrights were supposed to
be expiring pretty so

626
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,839
at some got ahold left

627
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:54,890
he bought thousands thousands movies
were supposed to be pretty worthless

628
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,600
and then course in 1776

629
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,509
they extended it for ninety years and in
1998 extended for twenty years

630
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,640
take up how many billions of dollars
he's made extra because that

631
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,740
and then our how do you keep track he
donated up billion dollars

632
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,920
in cash back to and it sounds a little
funny

633
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
he gave it to wipe all the World
Intellectual Property Organization

634
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,070
through United Nations so little bit
hard trail

635
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,560
fun they got paid back

636
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,980
the world public the World International

637
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,060
World Intellectual Property Association
rights both

638
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,549
the copyright station

639
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,960
so I was wondering about a comment he
made in the beginning

640
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,580
about it seemed him say data storage

641
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,839
is growing faster than more slow I K
faster than

642
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,089
processing capability is growing and
what you would say about

643
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:56,770
the implications ive amount of data we
have is going faster than

644
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:02,130
anything can read that data as growth of
content was the idea that it was there

645
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,440
sa the content is doubling faster
because we are so many more generators

646
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,790
content so that the yacht on leave
content available

647
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,270
is moving up forward faster than the
against the Francis

648
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,370
ship I just say

649
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,540
put it all in your computer let it run
for a week build an inverted index for

650
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,009
the whole

651
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,630
election and it's right there you think
you just do that every so often

652
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,040
and actually I'll tell you what morning
its easier to do that was something

653
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,270
different collections

654
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,600
no one large collection it's one of
those things as logarithmically any

655
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,620
vision

656
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,950
so you start adding him it takes longer
longer is that have just longer

657
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,850
so i would tell you to make one point
your hundred thousand

658
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,339
just about 200 people that kind blah
blah

659
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:50,029
female up

660
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,370
thanks ever suffer for indexing

661
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,359
not I don't like to recommend stuff

662
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:02,740
any particular brand anything I 5

663
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,780
I'd like to mention three things get
here response

664
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,750
first of all the federal government
agencies have increasingly been putting

665
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,910
copyright notices on a published works
as well as on their website

666
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:15,560
and it's not hard to find different
on-track if their contract they're

667
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,839
allowed to but they're doing it on
things that are not contract in ways

668
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,330
that it seem

669
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,950
improper thinkers ignorant people the
government too so it's not always malice

670
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,950
but it's highly improper

671
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,089
following far enough you usually find
that there was a contractor

672
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:31,870
there that's why absence were all
hanging are you

673
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,160
there's ways are finding it very easily
by using laptop isn't okay

674
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,589
the second is orphan works as a lotta
stuff nobody knows who owns it

675
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:41,660
no there's a lot of things that are
we're going on at like crazy

676
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,799
and prescriber if I see 10 gutenberg
works and i wanna read in print

677
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,260
I don't like me in my screen I can be my
screen very easily interceptor should be

678
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,810
off

679
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,830
should be buttons to to send them
somewhere for a nominal fee in

680
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,720
somebody should set up that that's not a
bad idea we're actually a little amid

681
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,770
with a deadly alarm piped out we can I
set up a satellite site that would I do

682
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,960
that link to that

683
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,020
I really all which is our main hosting
can't do commercial stuff at all really

684
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,130
but it's not a bad idea if you have an
idea for mechanism a recommendation or

685
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,060
are some wonder

686
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,609
as up with thats we would incur Zack
please those offices may be awesome

687
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:18,120
what is it any wonder kiosks at post
offices I was someplace we can send

688
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,759
these electronic books and print them
out in there's only a PO these

689
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,050
your promises to follow its just not
direct from our catalog that's also so

690
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,330
you get 10 different formats and 1
others could be

691
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,299
I send a slightly lower something else
in your printed book back great idea

692
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,790
want to make questions and/or here I dot
telling on a common

693
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,560

never used it before because

694
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,650
your materials typeset and that

695
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,500
you for you too you receive your
computer you could put it

696
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,740
anywhere you want and work to do it for
