has awesome

24
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,460
yeah I is now on most important formula

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,920
okay and then I'll go to Chicago also
introduce me to pumping station one this

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,860
is my introduction to hackerspace is you
saw me yesterday is wearing that shirt

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,220
Eric me show change my life this is how
you did it he introduced me to pumping

00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,060
station 1

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,490

alright so Packers what a deal alright

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,380
so happy to see things like tools right
and this is what they want to do it

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,769
they want to take it apart every single
piece that the agency

34
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,180
and anyone to rebuild it into something
of summer

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,780
yeah I okay so the real world are now

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,020
this is what happens education in the
real world cell we have a classroom

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,760
students

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,910
and the teacher is kinda like this

39
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,829
repeat rinse repeat the answer key at
Whitehaven's

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,030
I and this is what happens to us at the
end

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,650
twelve years of public education I'm

42
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,330
we all know how that feels this way
teachers and up like at the end up there

43
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,930
long happy careers and okay

44
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,180
they hear here's part of the issue
alright it's that we have a really neat

45
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,820
test

46
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,410
centric education system and tests

47
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,900
really suck I'm most ass

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,760
have questions for which the answer is
who gives a shit

49
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,899
I it's OC is as usual always cracked

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,910
alright also really ambiguous

51
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,130
I CMS yeah

52
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,579
I'm it this I it's not just give
fiftieth in the US there are a lot of

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,269
questions that are written

54
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,280
by people sitting in rooms you don't
really understand

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,310
mathematics nor children nor people

56
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,120
nor human interaction I'm and a my
question is that that relief have no

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,910
real world are sensible answer what so
ever

58
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,040
and I had a really popular KS

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,910
when I was teaching when I got a
question that was

60
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,049
on a really basic like popcorn which is
more

61
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,080
other better deal you going to movie
theater there's a really small pocket

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,580
but cost three dollars in a really big
bucket that's like four times baby cots

63
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,350
for dollars

64
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,260
and they say what should you buy and the
kids answer wise

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,790
while Obama's pay it depends

66
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,978
cuz I'm not hungry I really just want a
little popcorn

67
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:22,550
and it's cheaper than the big thing
about court right I spent my last dollar

68
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,810
I am I to check cuz I only really want a
couple pieces popcorn with my movie

69
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,550
great but the correct answer was the
four dollar giant honker a popcorn

70
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,169
um be cuz what they're really trying to
get you to do you

71
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:42,109
is to divide and compare which one has a
lower per-unit

72
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,099
value I if they ask her I

73
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:49,140
maybe the kids would have gotten it
right instead they're like

74
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,400
I think kids are too stupid to
understand comparing I'm

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,099
per unit values so let's make this tests
completely pointless for everyone

76
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:01,409
so I honestly think my kids are right it
absolutely does depend on the size your

77
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:01,910
appetite

78
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,830
K but also I'm there really long

79
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,229
and a really boring and tests have %ah

80
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,789
no funny words in it or funny pictures
it really just goes on forever

81
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,169
and no one has a good time either taking
them or grading them

82
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,299
or trying to get any sensible
information out of them

83
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,599
and sticky information may mean
absolutely nothing

84
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,820
there's not a lot of information I found
you can get from Taz you find out which

85
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,620
kids are good test takers

86
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,020
which doesn't really tell me which kids
are going to be successful

87
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,120
I it tells me which kids can

88
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,729
I have the attention span to sit 30
really really long periods of time and

89
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,789
still maintain interest

90
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:47,900
on usually good test takers wind up
being

91
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,860
really boring people right it's a really
how I ended up being

92
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,620
on wall street. thinking that my soul is
draining away cuz he realize I was

93
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,229
really good test taker I was hanging out
another good test takers

94
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:04,520
and I really bored me I'm not to say
that every good test taker end up being

95
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,630
away seven individual or something it's
just it's a it's an

96
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,930
its offense cuz hopefully I'm not always
have an individual cuz I was gonna

97
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,219
taking test but

98
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,390
it gets to a point where you wake up and
you go wow I don't want to spend the

99
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,060
rest of my life taking tests and twelve
years a school

100
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,339
has taught me how to be successful at
taking tests

101
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,930
right this is what ends up to students
this is what ends up to teachers and

102
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,760
when teachers get like this

103
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,150
I at least in New York City /a whereas
public school teacher for a while

104
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,479
may end up in what's called the barroom
and this is a lovely little space where

105
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,080
teachers guile where

106
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,080
if you flip at a child or molest a child
or something in your tenure teacher or

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,219
you can actually be fired from the
system but you're not allowed to be

108
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,740
around children anymore

109
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,770
so you get put into a prison with other
teachers and you had to do things like

110
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,450
raise your hands asked to go to the
bathroom or you delete your cell

111
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,880
and from a tough for you have to sit
there

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,460
every single day getting paid a full ten
your teacher salary

113
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,529
doing the nothing on but twiddling your
thumbs

114
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:10,130
you're not allowed to leave you are not
allowed to

115
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,500
really communicate I'm your your
casually allowed to be

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,900
right so I'm

117
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,830
this said little bit of a problem right
so here is what politicians tell us

118
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,539
right

119
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:26,150
they tell us your face I value education
I value education

120
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,159
this is all the stuff that I want to do
to change education

121
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,779
so I'm recently to read well maybe not
really not recently but there is a Bill

122
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,409
No Child Left Behind

123
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:39,000
I end the bush-era and that sounded
really nice

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,099
it actually said we want to make sure
that every child

125
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:46,000
is successful the result is that as far
as teachers are concerned

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,550
is now be passed every single child who
does it

127
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,750
deserve to pass I'm a so that if

128
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,539
a school is struggling and not
succeeding maybe the teachers are pushed

129
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,520
to help the children

130
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
cheat a little on the task give them a
few extra hints

131
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,950
maybe after its done erased now wrong
answer then put in some correct answer

132
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,810
is

133
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,899
if they actually know what the correct
answers are

134
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm and i actually there was there was a
study done

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,599
I'm by up with author Freakonomics

136
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,010
Steve Levitt yeah he he he did a little
study on how certain grade school

137
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,800
teachers were helping their students
cheat on

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,690
standardized exams by taking them
erasing some answers and filling in

139
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,729
correct answer is the only problem is
they weren't exactly sure what the

140
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,240
correct answers were themselves and
sometimes just change stress answers

141
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,839
even to wrong answers

142
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,729
and yeah another problem is with the
teachers themselves

143
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,089
if you do not pay teachers

144
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,270
a livable salary which a lot of states
do not

145
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,380
then you're not going to get qualified
teachers

146
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,310
shocking how that works out hot all the
smart people realize hey I can make more

147
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,000
money doing something else and they
don't become teachers

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,390
so we end up with people who don't know
anything as teachers and then we

149
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,660
complain why the teachers suck

150
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,000
um sorry I do a terrible job

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm so politicians tend to you promise a
lot of things and then not give the

152
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,490
funding for it so we're ending up asking
where's the money

153
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,000
and politicians assume that grows on
state Res

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,589
K I'm so little bit I love

155
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,899
hope for all what education hacking
might look like right so this again

156
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,230
going back to the map hired by now work
for

157
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,110
at the University of Chicago he's
possibly and he runs a number I love

158
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,190
inquiry-based

159
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,070
learning i'm craig salons and increase
based learning

160
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,270
is actually I'm

161
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:51,270
where the teacher does as little as
possible on the students to you as most

162
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,810
a most the work so the whole point at
this is

163
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,089
and even the number of programs where
the teacher soon ratios

164
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,320
is extremely low maybe 125 127

165
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,770
I'm so a very well-educated

166
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,060
and teacher or counselor and very often

167
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,200
its a he hand-picked his best not seems
to be counselors

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,250
in groups I'm with anywhere from

169
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,430
all 11 to 18-year-olds students

170
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,760
and learning some rigorous mathematics
and

171
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,350
there has never been a need to dumb down

172
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,410
the cases I'm no one has ever had to say
well you know

173
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,209
I I'd like to explain in to roll
calculus to you all but your little

174
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,770
stupid

175
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,350
so I'm we're going to put it into a nice
little picture

176
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,000
and try and use little kid words to try
and explain it to you now are the kids

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,090
embrace the fact that this is a
challenge

178
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,020
and they're expected to take on that
challenge and no one is there to help

179
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,880
them

180
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,290
no spoon feed the information into their
heads there

181
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,339
asked to produce proofs on their own a

182
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,940
I at their own pace on their own time at
their own level

183
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,390
and in this case it takes a long time
for them to get

184
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,990
but they eventually learn to pick up the
talk go to the bar themselves and they

185
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,000
have an idea

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,510
discuss it with their peers and really
discover

187
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,790
and really routine mathematics
theoretical high level mathematics

188
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,490
I'm that are almost never taught and
high school level

189
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,870
I'm so here couple the programs he runs
and some

190
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,060
links for them I sesame program I worked
with a group of middle school teachers

191
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,860
and this is

192
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,840
I me a lot of people I found a really
shocked working with middle school

193
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,530
teachers to find well

194
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,980
you don't know how to add integers you
don't know how to multiply fractions you

195
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,030
don't really know what a fraction is

196
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,430
I'm but unfortunate fact of the matter
is our standards for

197
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,880
testing to see if you are qualified
teacher are so low

198
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,290
I that it doesn't take a lot to pass and
become qualified as teacher in Chicago

199
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,569
you get a license actually for
kindergarten through eighth grade

200
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,790
I'm so there are a tray teachers who
would like to teach

201
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,870
alger brought to their eighth-graders
and really only have the math ability of

202
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,000
a fourth grader

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,430
I'm so that makes their job really
difficult so sesame is around

204
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,010
to you help um increase

205
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,870
the map content knowledge I love these
middle school teachers so that they

206
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,350
actually capable

207
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,750
I love teaching and knowledge at a
higher level than these kids

208
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,480
are learning at up because really you
can't be the the purpose

209
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,720
the idea is you can't %uh speech

210
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,260
what you don't know ten times more

211
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,660
so you have to be ten times more
qualified in order to teach something

212
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,219
right k ad the other 1i wanna talk about
young scholars program is a program for

213
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,970
very very talented

214
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,900
a mathematically advance I'm middle
school and high school students that

215
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,810
show up at the University of Chicago

216
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,820
on Saturday is every other Saturday to

217
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,210
learn things like not the area number
theory um

218
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,240
and the common they do it and they work
hard and they get homework

219
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,290
and I do that to you on top of the home
market school because they have fun with

220
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,020
it

221
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,020
the collegiate scholars program I'm
working on that this summer that is a

222
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,449
college readiness program on to get
inner-city school students

223
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,380
who aren't getting prepared by their so
called college prep

224
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,270
academies I'm ready for college K

225
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,400
so check that out now if you want to
talk about map for america

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,400
this is one of those many programs that
tries to bridge the

227
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,500
gap between why is it that there are so
many

228
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,630
I'm teachers who don't really know what
they're talking about but not America

229
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,300
also backed up with

230
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,970
money which is why they get really
really smart people once this program

231
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,160
I not only today finds your master's
degree in education

232
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,640
but I the also give a stipend

233
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,210
something like ten to twenty thousand
dollars per year on top

234
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,260
I love your salary if you decide to
become a public school teacher in their

235
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,780
program you have to work in this for
five years

236
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,959
I'm and they make it so that you can
actually live a very very comfortable

237
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,690
existence in New York City

238
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,910
while being a teacher am so they attract
a lot of talent into schools

239
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,230
and so a little bit us about classes so
where does

240
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,540
hackerspace is coming in so I want to
talk about specifically

241
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,000
the classes that had disappeared okay so
like shot glasses this old picture I

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,450
love guys working

243
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,700
aunt tools remember when we had tools
and high schools

244
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,420
on video exist anymore we're not allowed
to touch tool they're taking way bunsen

245
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,970
burners from classroom because God
forbid to some kid goes

246
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,490
do I wonder what feel like I'm

247
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,970
so no not to get in trouble so we're
taking anything that has any potential

248
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,950
danger soon we will be outlying

249
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,180
up pens and pencils from classrooms
because they're too sharp

250
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,880
yes kids on a large sharp scissors
anymore so god why are we allowing them

251
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,890
to use things like pencils

252
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,020
going back to crayons alright also what
happened to things like

253
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:06,180
home at probably because at the ya how
does hot feel like question

254
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,010
alright so now our laps thinking

255
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,150
what a is right

256
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:20,939
gosh I don't know I so if this is what
happens here so show can make a comeback

257
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,840
this is %uh and I see resistor and
they're trying to your bills for their

258
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,950
new space

259
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,150
I'm also home etc etc and make a
comeback

260
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,430
all sorts of chemistry and burning
obeying the AF

261
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,860
okay no spaces spaces spaces or what are
the future spaces

262
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,540
right i wanna talk about a couple spaces
her spaces

263
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,980
Lake TX and I see resistor I'm they are
already available offering classes to

264
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,529
the public

265
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:52,420
great I'm you're allowed to touch things
you're allowed to use tools

266
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,160
you're allowed to make things hot and
trusted not to

267
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,199
burn yourselves with them I and
miraculously

268
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,160
you know no one is really cut their own
head of yet

269
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,319
I'm wow I guess we weren't as stupid as
schools made it out to be

270
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,470
so I it's already here it's already
happening we already have spaces

271
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,779
available

272
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:20,270
to teach um adults to teach children to
work with their hands again

273
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,760
rate also maker spaces maker spaces are
very similar

274
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,020
her spaces and that it is an open
community that offers

275
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,520
um public classes so this is %ah a
picture out

276
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,550
a bucket works in milwaukee on that runs
all sorts of programs i've seen

277
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:43,650
spaces available for high schoolers to
go in a when their school says

278
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,660
know where it not allow you to put on
this

279
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,170
Shakespearean play because it has

280
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,279
I inferences to you nudity and penises

281
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,730
yes shakespeare was a dirty man but he
also wrote brilliant poetry

282
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,169
so a bucket works allow them to put on a
Shakespearean play in their space

283
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:09,730
on there also I art gallery is open by
children by neighborhood students

284
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,189
and there's a gardening projects for the
community I'm

285
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,919
so this is all potential thing was a
hackerspace is a maker spaces could

286
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,439
become for education

287
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,600
also other public spaces this is a
picture I love the New York City Public

288
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,529
Library

289
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:29,510
I the potential this space is huge there
are ready

290
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,879
all sorts %uh education all gatherings
here they're just not not just

291
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,320
meetings and conferences I'm their class
is being held

292
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,418
I'll for all levels um their book
reading

293
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,120
book readings and book signings but
libraries curry leaf

294
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,120
be a potential space for

295
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,539
the future development I love hands-on
education

296
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,158
I mean if we take away look at those
practically empty rows

297
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,529
that are just sitting there waiting for
people to say in Redbox

298
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:05,549
how do I still read books right of them

299
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:09,309
on how many have you read books on your
computer

300
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,370
how many guys read books on a Ken doll
or what is it I'll

301
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,070
I don't a knock or something yeah I'm
miso

302
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,240
books all our a wall being

303
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,340
to um in I

304
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,559
a virtual form seoul bits Adams I

305
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,710
and it's constantly changing into that
I'm

306
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,960
it might even come to the point where
our children and our children's children

307
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,630
don't really need a physical book
anymore they can upload 3,000 books onto

308
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,860
something that has virtual pages

309
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,640
and then what's to become a library is
well why don't we have libraries

310
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,249
as borrow spaces for tools um

311
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:53,480
look at this huge hallway that could
potentially be filled

312
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,769
with what was once the shop class that
is now

313
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,159
well a liability issue 04

314
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:05,090
high schools and middle schools and
elementary schools and we had set up

315
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,689
classrooms once more our people ten

316
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,820
work with their hands and learn what
these things are for

317
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,259
ray and not to like circle things on
paper and make sure to fill inside the

318
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,419
lines

319
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:21,570
us so that they don't get marks wrong
buy a scantron paper

320
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,200
brain so

321
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,409
okay I that's pretty much it so I'm done
is super early if so

322
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:37,409
questions yeah

323
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:50,539
unschooling what you mean by that

324
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,830
K honestly don't think there is our
right realm for anything education is

325
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,689
education

326
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,710
and whether self-motivated or

327
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,470
know given to you I'm if you wanna learn
you learn

328
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,530
and heart I love education is not
teaching

329
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,590
you to absorb information but teaching
you how to learn right

330
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,639
so I unschooling um is

331
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,670
I mean I've heard a lot of I've heard a
lot of versions I mean it is another

332
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,170
version

333
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:57,390
increase based learning I'm it depends
on the parents right if the parents

334
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,690
are very knowledgeable and have a lot to
offer a that kinda

335
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,300
limits a chill child development I'm all
for public schools because it teaches

336
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,180
you skills you cannot learn from parents

337
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,900
on one essential skills how to interact
with kids your own age

338
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,400
and you're never gonna learn that if
you're going to be home school the whole

339
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,870
time

340
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,880
and so it's always beneficial to go into
you

341
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,960
even if you are home schooled I think
actually I'm

342
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,000
Tiffany rad is she here she starting a
new space is very focused on education

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,680
and she's bringing in a lot of the is

344
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,960
unschooled kids to work with each other

345
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,330
in a hackerspace so I think that's a
great development

346
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,550
um potential death I was great

347
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,940
yes hmm

348
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,560

359
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:18,620

bills

366
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,259
that's actually not just in Maine

367
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:56,669
you're absolutely like that that
everywhere all of them at not yet was

368
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,429
your second question

369
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:00,710
so yeah was your question

370
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,379
also no I haven't

371
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:09,149
teaching as a subversive activity who
wrote it

372
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,950
how its

373
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,869
okay letter talk

374
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:23,869
okay

375
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:32,540
mmm

376
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,700
hmm and then the second question though
this is that the first question was

377
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,060
about

378
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,270
and why is it that that the kid to take

379
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,670
shop classes or go to vocational schools
actually on

380
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,720
that so those are using for are that
dumb kids in a smart kid %uh

381
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,720
become professors right yeah who wrote
this it sounds really familiar to me

382
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,600
now

383
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,780
hmm

384
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:14,780
its

385
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,720
yeah

386
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,340
okay I'm actually going to answer the
second question for so there are

387
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,250
actually a lot I've

388
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,050
cases samples are teachers who I'm have
trouble teaching their kids

389
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,310
to ask questions on I have a really hard
time every single year that I have new

390
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,850
Kia students coming to me they're
literally afraid to ask questions

391
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,920
because of how many roadblocks the hit
before they ask a simple question

392
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,450
I love um while why did this work

393
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,750
and then they're told to shut up because
um

394
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,980
sometimes it's because the teachers
trying to rush through and sometimes

395
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,840
because teachers trying to cover up for
the fact that he or she doesn't know the

396
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,340
answer

397
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,520
I'm I try to make it today

398
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,740
if I don't know the answer we can find
out and they're always tools to find out

399
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,410
a better answer than shut up

400
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,290
is actually I'm not sure why don't you
go look it up in a book

401
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:10,440
those things exists and i actually teach
the kid to ask question and then figure

402
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,070
out how to answer his or her

403
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,070
all question instead of shutting that's
you down so that is a huge problem

404
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,870
happens and another thing with this
whole smart stupid

405
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,440
dichotomy why is it that there are only
two choices you can be smart

406
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,450
are you can be stupid um you can do a
lot of things actually you know what

407
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,060
my a family friends all think I'm pretty
stupid

408
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,460
I left a really high paying job to go do
something like that is

409
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,410
more marked and pay is 1/4 apply learned
at 200 butterfly on Dec 22 years old

410
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:49,750
so I'm pretty dumb on I'm also pretty
darn love for are coming to you things

411
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,130
like that hacker conference is because
their subversive activity coming

412
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,830
in this through these doors I'm gonna
get myself and a lot of trouble so I

413
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,610
should keep my mouth shut and run away

414
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,700
and hides a lot of stupid things that I
do to really I don't think are very

415
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,400
stupid

416
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,180
I feel like every student needs to learn
how to work with his or her hands

417
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,970
because it's a basic skills so you have
all be supposedly smart

418
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,550
kids when the zombie apocalypse comes
they will be sitting there

419
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:23,560
hiding on how the world will end and the
stupid kids it will be a running OK

420
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:30,560
to our

421
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:38,780
so I think you had your hand up in the
back

422
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:41,000
alright thank you

423
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,710
pics thank you

424
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,710
route

425
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,720
I don't think there's a I honestly don't
think there's an issue school being

426
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,700
compulsory because you can say you have
to go to school

427
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,980
and then kids actually really like
direction especially to very young age

428
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,650
you have to tell them you know you have
to you

429
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,070
I like your bottom after you're done
going to bathroom you know

430
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,010
on you need to eat with tools are not
your hands on you say please and thank

431
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,440
you

432
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,549
so there we're told a lot of thing
that's how we learn to socialize it is

433
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:25,679
one of the things we get into a routine
I think school in some senses

434
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,280
for love organizationally challenge
students especially it helps

435
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,520
get them into the routine of going to
work every single day this is my job

436
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,580
this is what I do

437
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,110
on idoney I don't I don't think I don't
think it's a bad thing

438
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,650
um by I think there's a problem when
we're teaching kids

439
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,179
that the thing that you go to every day
to spend most of your time Wed should be

440
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:45,900
something

441
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,360
that you dislike I think that's actually
why so many adults one acre lot

442
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,080
they find jobs in a really don't like
because we're ready trained

443
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,678
buyer schools to do that we find
something

444
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,780
that we have to do and we do it

445
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,860
even though it sucks where they feel if
we made schools a fun and the kids want

446
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,500
to come

447
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,289
working the summer programs that I have
the University of Chicago Paul Sally

448
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:15,280
I haven't seen a student who said I
really don't wanna be here because it

449
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,960
they didn't

450
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,010
go home it's a Saturday you don't have
to be here

451
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,700
and yet they feel they have to come
because they're learning and they're

452
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,559
enjoying it

453
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:28,918
so I'm hoping that these smart kids are
going to learn to learn to move on and

454
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,809
do things that I actually fascinate them
in interest and make them want to wake

455
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,230
up every morning go to work

456
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,240
rate K oh my god so many hands

457
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,240
I would close my eyes yeah okay I guess
is you

458
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,429
um what can you repeat the question
again

459
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:12,120
or art ole you want me to repeat the
question okay alright

460
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,140
on so let you want to say if

461
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,659
if there isn't I'm if they resent a
course

462
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,260
a local course available for soon and
they would like to take a virtual course

463
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,379
on can they do that I think

464
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,390
if a student is motivated to learn and
that

465
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,070
kind of information is available um by
all means there should be a

466
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,418
as much opportunity to learn as possible
arm

467
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,770
hands-on learning is just so much more

468
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,780
interactive like if you if you look at
Seans there've been surveys John

469
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,570
where I teachers teach

470
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,960
I think this is primarily for math
teachers can a math teacher

471
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,980
I'm eighty-five percent of teachers
teach up face

472
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,890
on um visual learning so they'll write
things down and I'll form

473
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,169
they'll put in formulate famous for
students to memorize

474
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:06,929
and it turns out ninety percent %uh
students are calisthenics learners

475
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:10,049
which means they learn by emotion they
learned by

476
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:13,158
using their hands they learned by
interaction with others

477
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,240
on so all these things are are are
lacking when you're talking about

478
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,510
a virtual course I'm however there are
people who

479
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,250
really take on to that the visual
learners right the people who really

480
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,520
follow the the rigor love I'll
formulates

481
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm posse is so I'm I think it depends
on the person

482
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,580
I'm always I think an interactive class

483
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,650
trumps I and online course

484
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,240
so K

485
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:49,240
arm over here

486
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:56,140
what kinda programs okay so

487
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,720
so you're talking about what will I
think about enrichment programs aren't

488
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,909
are only there as sorta like %ah us

489
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:10,909
what kinda Karen set

490
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:24,340
yeah

491
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,480
there

492
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,760
yep that's actually on back China stuff
is used

493
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,820
all love the time actually i say

494
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,590
the majority I love on third the
extracurricular activities

495
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,590
are there for that it's not just I'll be
getting Taloja programs

496
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,610
it's %ah sports arts music

497
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,320
feeder so it's like wow you know if you
don't behave

498
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,930
and mister Smith's class in the we are
going to take away this aspect up your

499
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,770
education

500
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,910
I'm yeah it's it's really it's really
unfortunate

501
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,910
um instead what schools should be
realizing

502
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,670
is these curriculums are actually
teaching the students anything look at

503
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,340
what the students

504
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,750
actually want to go to: if the students
actually wanna go to basketball practice

505
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,190
every single day that just means the
basketball is more compelling

506
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,890
why don't you show them literature
behind that why don't you teach them the

507
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,980
mathematics of the game why don't you
teach them probability theory

508
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,700
why is it that you are forcing them to
you take tests

509
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,340
and fill in bubbles I'm so in center
changing

510
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,660
the curriculum to you fit what the
students really

511
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,670
want to learn and that I think want the
benefits on schooling that you can

512
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,270
choose what it is what happened you
would like to take

513
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,400
to learn all these basic tools I'm but
you're absolutely right

514
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
it's unfortunate that its use as a
punishment like

515
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,640
here we're going to take away the one
thing that you're learning from

516
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,440
so that you can sit still in a class so
that's really great for the kids with

517
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,550
ADHD by the way

518
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,610
yeah right

519
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:13,610
from front

520
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,920
I'll you're absolutely right in that so
the question was about

521
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,990
elementary school learning because thats
Owen a lot of these basics get grounded

522
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,369
in

523
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:38,640
on actually I think elementary school
all %uh

524
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,470
teaching is one of the core reasons for
why there's such a huge fear

525
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:48,529
mathematics in america I'm because the
standard for becoming a teacher is

526
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:52,009
relatively low you actually have a lot
of teachers who were are very passionate

527
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,640
about their jobs really care and care
about the students

528
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,400
om who don't know map Obama so when
asked to teach basic mathematics like

529
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,980
on the number line teaching kids how to
you add fractions how to divide numbers

530
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,259
on the teachers themselves don't have a
good ground

531
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,650
on grounding on what that actually means

532
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,690
and so what that translates into I
actually heard

533
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,039
elementary school teachers say I am
afraid amass I don't like math

534
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:24,329
and the kids take that away with them of
the teacher doesn't like math and I

535
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,799
don't like math either because

536
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:30,390
I want to do with the teachers says you
know thats most children reacted that

537
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,930
way

538
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,038
and that translates later in life on

539
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,279
there's a really fascinating study done
in the nineteen thirties there was this

540
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,549
great curriculum that was %uh put in
place

541
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,038
and I forget I forget the guys name I'm
not to look it up

542
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:49,289
I am ask me it like email me now a look
this up for you but there was on

543
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,660
a district in schools in Rochester in
upstate New York

544
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,920
and he got away with it because at the
time there was an immigrant other

545
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,420
immigrant focus community

546
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,569
and couldn't speak a lot of English so
when he set up a notice like I'm

547
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,910
changing the curriculum is going to be
an experimental case

548
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,140
another parents could read the notice so
um

549
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,538
they signed it and then like okay and
%uh he

550
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,359
got this curriculum past and it was

551
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,769
is really interesting he told me
immigrant kids and for the first three

552
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:20,730
years top ten basic logic skills
thinking skills critical reasoning

553
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,950
reading and then around the third and
fourth grade started at pushing in

554
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,839
mathematics

555
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,019
so then there was like that the teachers
were very good at mathematics

556
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:35,369
top came NN top them on number theory in
group theory and then they

557
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:39,450
had a mathematical foundation based on
the logic in critical reasoning skills

558
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,089
that they learned from

559
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:46,500
analytical reading on and they ended up
being highly highly successful

560
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,210
so after 12 years through this system on
day at the All remembered you know this

561
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,839
was

562
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,410
the all remember their experience in a
very very positive way

563
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,828
I'm so what happened to the system in
Weiden spread

564
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:02,809
I it wise I successful

565
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:07,029
to you the point that but textbook
publishers got upset

566
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:11,630
because he wasn't following their
curriculum so what they did was

567
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,160
I'm the textbook publishers sent assist
someone to do a study in the schools

568
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,390
on to see how well this curriculum was
running I'm and Amy

569
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,788
interview teachers and students
integrate cross-sectional study and they

570
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,220
came to the conclusion

571
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,250
the distance %uh curriculum was
unsuccessful

572
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,799
because it didn't follow the textbook
curriculum therefore we need to change

573
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:33,730
curriculum

574
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,029
to follow the textbook Creek elem I on

575
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:41,720
and that got tossed out and he was I
asked to resign from his post

576
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,930
and he said fuck you I'm gonna work at
the university and as for the dead

577
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,339
I am nothing if not so race at home yes

578
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:55,339
you what did you follow up for that yeah
so um

579
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,250
yeah actually I can talk to politicians
I can talk to school board's it really

580
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,750
doesn't get a lot

581
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,299
pushed what really happens is on yeah
here's what happens when a teacher tries

582
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:13,299
to talk to their principal I know
because I've done that every single time

583
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:14,200
I for to school

584
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,230
when you try to tell your principle this
isn't working the kids aren't learning

585
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,130
on the go can you please leave get out
here please I N

586
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,200
when you talk to school board's about
this doesn't work they go

587
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,710
on me I can you leave us alone run away
please and

588
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,269
so when when you talk to politicians
they go I Graha

589
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,710
I'll do something about it and the
runaway I'm so

590
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,490
really a lot of these these programs
lobbies freestanding programs are in

591
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,539
place like the reason I'm reaching out
to hackerspace is a maker spaces

592
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,900
is because I am preaching to the choir
because you guys are

593
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,460
I'm genuinely concerned about a real
education here you know this is what

594
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,329
we're all here about

595
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:53,680
right we're here because we are geeks
and we like to learn and play with

596
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,129
things

597
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,259
and and change the world so I'm

598
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:03,269
I'd like us to be the next big a
movement for education because

599
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:08,190
we know how it's done right so if I'm
gonna talk to the school board

600
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,700
they're not going to listen to because
we don't have evidence so once

601
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,779
hackerspace is

602
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:16,269
start feeling with more students than
schools

603
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:21,289
then we have a case many wanna make
schools more like hackerspace is again

604
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:28,289
K all in back

605
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,359
yeah so I'm here

606
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:38,900
I'm that's the problem with that I'll
politicians promise money and there's

607
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,810
never money

608
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,480
to be given around I it's not just your
classroom

609
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,690
its every classroom and part of the
issue isn't just

610
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,210
I don't have the funds to bring all this
cool stuff in the classroom

611
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,460
why do you think suddenly shop is
dangerous why is it suddenly the bunsen

612
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,820
burners are dangerous Wireshark scissors
dangerous

613
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,980
well if you look at a private school the
teacher to student ratio is something

614
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,340
like 12 15

615
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,790
if you look at a public school the
teacher student ratio is about 12 40

616
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,259
one teacher in a classroom a forty
students

617
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,440
even if the students love you will not
get

618
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,560
nearly as much accomplished as one
teacher

619
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,009
in a classroom a fifteen so our Chicago
Department of Education

620
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,930
I just cut 2000 teachers because they
ran outta money

621
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:33,970
to make up for that they increase the
minimum Posada's is from 32 to 37

622
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,740
classroom sizes were already a over
thirty-two

623
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,960
will be run average 37 so meeting a
limit from 32 to 37

624
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,920
means moving limit from 37 to 42 one
teacher

625
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,190
forty two kids 40 minutes in a lesson

626
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,660
think about how much time each teacher
has reached student

627
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,980
we want to do hands-on education we
can't because we have about as much time

628
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,680
to go

629
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,330
touch your finger to this I got a ticket
when a yeah

630
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:09,330
I am

631
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:20,930
min

632
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,060
I laid out the problems in adults I
though

633
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,080
classroom time working currently are
teaching theoretical mathematics so

634
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,090
there's not like

635
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,810
bits is it like some kind of new
technology base or anything

636
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,620
on there are programs i've seen. I know
MIT Johns Hopkins

637
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,970
um a numbered university is do you

638
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,810
outreach programs for students to learn
a lot of technology they learn how to

639
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,460
code to learn how to build stuff

640
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:54,460
um

641
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:01,570
I'll hmm

642
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,720
yeah

643
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,750
so I I so much I love my opinion on this
is

644
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,160
some some people say because kids are so
use a technology

645
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,279
on so the I'm sorry the question was you
know kids are so i'm attuned to their

646
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,440
technology without using you have
technologies to teach basic skills

647
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,290
on kids I think that some students some
up people will say

648
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,090
I kids are so attuned to technology the
only way to really reach out to them is

649
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,580
with new technology even teaching the
most basic stuff

650
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,190
and then there are people who say um
kids are so to take technology didn't

651
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,200
realize there's a world in front of them
when you take them away from the

652
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,180
technology to teach them the basic
skills

653
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,660
I'm I think in some ways the combination
I think I technology is a tool just like

654
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,259
any other

655
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,970
so we can't rely on a single tool
because that's like

656
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,360
telling only the kids who can take test
that you're smart

657
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,550
right what if we're now telling only the
people who can

658
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,310
I'll work with technology that they're
smart on

659
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,980
or what if we were to tell only the
artists that they were the only smart

660
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,840
ones in the world

661
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,830
rate I'm it's unfair either way we want
to teach kids how to use all sorts

662
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,830
love tools on technology is a part of
that

663
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,920
and but also teaching them how to you

664
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,630
work with each other without a computer
taking all the technology away from the

665
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,290
classroom

666
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,450
on thats a basic communication skill to

667
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:39,450
yeah

668
00:47:07,249 --> 00:47:10,319
of college college I went to college

669
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,950
I want to really spend some college on
who gave me a nice piece of paper and

670
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,109
now gets brag about like look at me

671
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:21,269
I went to college day um I did learn a
lot from college

672
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:24,400
now it's a really good guy Heinze hun

673
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,989
and I think part of the reason is
college follows the exact same model as

674
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:29,079
schools deal

675
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,460
so I'm if you really I feel like if you
are a real education

676
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,470
and you don't care about the degree arm

677
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:41,190
sit in on classes you're interested in
gold build something go ask someone who

678
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,730
is

679
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,069
%uh really a professional in his or her
field

680
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:48,220
and say what do you do how do you do it
how I learn I

681
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,099
and that's really I've learned a lot
more by just talking to people

682
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:56,239
incentive no taking classes for credit
getting a grade for it

683
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,309
I I actually think in some ways it
hinders it because colleges tell you you

684
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,289
have to do this you have to do this year
did maintain a certain

685
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:09,130
I curriculum arm and really learning is
it about that especially if you're at

686
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:13,589
the college level college is about
exploring new options after that on and

687
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:16,799
I think unfortunately the entire system
is built on

688
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:21,150
arm just thinking in using a pen and
paper and taking tests and

689
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,569
taking information and spitting backup
um

690
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:28,099
and in college suffers from the exact
same problems that

691
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:31,960
grade school lol education suffers from

692
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,960
yeah so mom from the side

693
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,650
okay so the question was as parents how
do we make sure kids learn about the

694
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,069
information when they seemed only be
interested in one thing right

695
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:04,140
okay I'm I think interest is something
that's not

696
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,308
I we shouldn't teach our kids to be
interested in many things we should

697
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:09,769
teach our kids to learn

698
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:13,609
many things on point things out make
them curious because

699
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:17,799
in especially like in the elementary
school years kids are very open to

700
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:18,430
direction

701
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:23,200
on it gets ingrained you know this was
the one thing that you're good at

702
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,349
this is the one thing that you're smart
you're dumb and everything else

703
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:29,849
on we can train kids to to veer away
from famous

704
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:33,839
that are difficult for them on actually
there was a great New York Times article

705
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,210
that will came out about

706
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,470
I'm kids who are receiving lot of
positive praise

707
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,559
really successful kids at school are

708
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:44,819
actually afraid to move forward and
learn more

709
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:48,720
because they have been praised for being
correct every single step

710
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,930
in their education so god forbid

711
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:56,019
they're not correct you going forward so
then they're not going to be prey is

712
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:57,789
what we should really be praising is

713
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:01,119
all I got you got something well
excellent how do we fix it

714
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,849
why don't we try harder why don't we
move on to new frontiers

715
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:08,160
right so we should be praising mistakes
we should be praising what they don't

716
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,828
know

717
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:12,910
and that way they learn what I don't
know isn't something to be feared

718
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:19,910
it's something to be conquered on group
has its lookin

719
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:31,690
I mean to deduce speaker ready ok

720
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,740
right um that's a really good question
the question was about %ah

721
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,259
what do I know about current programs
available with hackerspace is working

722
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:12,460
with public education

723
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,490
on there are certain liability issues
that

724
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,599
have to be taken into consideration the
hackerspace is have huge liabilities if

725
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,279
they allow a classroom

726
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:24,380
in that they don't they haven't you know
even if you sign wavers

727
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:29,579
okay let me when his answer this
question 1a right so even if you even if

728
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:30,819
you sign wavers you're not

729
00:51:30,819 --> 00:51:34,670
fully protecting yourself so I'm i've
seen

730
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:37,749
I cases like this actually I'm

731
00:51:37,749 --> 00:51:40,880
the art teacher that works and dust mite
my last blog

732
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,539
I he came here I got him to come here
and talk to NYC resistor

733
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:47,730
to talk about maybe meeting in a neutral
space that is in the school

734
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,839
I which has its liabilities and is in
the space which is

735
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:54,740
has its liability is so maybe if they
can find unusual classroom space for the

736
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,549
kids can learn

737
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:59,190
on that's one common ground that they
found their I'm

738
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,700
also bucket works in milwaukee that's a
maker space that actually welcomes kids

739
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,579
in after hours they have high school
that's across the street where all the

740
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:11,230
stupid kids who haven't succeeded are
going to that school to learn

741
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,589
how to go to prison later I'm but after
school

742
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:19,910
they go across the street and going to
fuck it works and evade build robots and

743
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,098
dealer code and they do things and
they're smart

744
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,430
you know I'm and their top everything
they were tot

745
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,710
made them stupid before is actually
wrong I'm

746
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:34,039
again tippy bad is starting a very very
education focus

747
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:37,380
I'm hackerspace in DC is so you should
talk to rent check that out

748
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,599
I am the mats what I now also

749
