fix the world is

9
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,790
pretty much how it effects are
everything we do and how similar

10
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,960
are relaxed the rules are to really

me

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,710
list

21
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,320
you

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,720
few min awesome spike

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,520
martial arts

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,280
its

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,380
style

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,460
reason

27
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,060
it

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,190
you

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,550
so a lot we wanted to know

30
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,270
just to define what a real expert who is
on

31
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,030
and also to explore the history this
this goes back to 1969

32
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,520
why this information we know until
recently so that's really exciting us

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,440
we move back in did the research and
their journalism pieces

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,220
I love people going out in fighting
crime as far back as 1970

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,350
which is really say no us console table
about that

36
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,460
that's gonna give an overview love how
to start

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,280
you're interested in it and now with
more than 100 missions

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,459
so the median is called the roads were a
lot of things

39
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,770
gives the military figures this is the
front page

40
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,910
issue this is a this week's issue the
New York Press

41
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,940
I on real issue because it specifically
the New York initiative which is the

42
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,790
team that on Sat night down did with

43
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,000
to others essentially women college
stuff we've been

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,930
said that we're basically live action
role players people said that we're

45
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,440
dangers vigilantes are there were some
had a militia

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,709
or that weird crazy

47
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,519
on so there's there's been a lot of
stuff from the these papers

48
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,550
and with the community at large is the
real issue here community unfortunately

49
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,989
all that's true even that mad

50
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,340
on but ultimately it's cooler

51
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,500
there are a lotta love really excellent
qualities in the release your community

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,620
and now they interact with actors in
love with so essentially real issue here

53
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,040
was someone that emulates comic book
superhero

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,769
in that they may be hand anonymity or
where mass

55
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,299
and they go either to fight crime and
justice and others use

56
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,670
the persona the superhero to engage in
sharing

57
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,980
with mainstream media as it is if you
are really good person any go out and

58
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,500
use them amazing terrible murder
activism

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,080
you're not going to get picked up just
being yourself however

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,930
eighty put on a mask in case you make
from agencies so

61
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,320
in this kind of the world it paid to
think outside the box enter

62
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,870
do something that gets get the attention
of people that are really just looking

63
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,500
for something for shock value

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,900
so the first person to do this was an
end

65
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,730
been a min the box misses handle on his
real name was James Phillips

66
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,590
and in 1969 he was a

67
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,110
middle school science teacher in the top
two to his class about all kinds and I'm

68
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,870
not agreed

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,950
gauged in things that were wrong with
society

70
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,599
and when a student said what are you
doing tonight he sowed rental cars to

71
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,690
move the stuff

72
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,690
how are you lecturing about all these
evils in society

73
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,590
win you're part of the problem and so
according to legend is really the

74
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,740
on you impose the hard he really start
to think about that

75
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,919
there's a company that was pumping toxic
chemicals

76
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,159
into the city's water supply and nothing
was being done about it the company said

77
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,229
that the chemicals

78
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:45,060
their reasoning has no harm to the
environment or to the

79
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,180
drinking supply so what he did was he
went in on

80
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,550
plugged up %uh the what was draining
into the

81
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,010
into the river and of course the reason
immediately

82
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,180
nom the Stanley Cup doing this again and
again

83
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,599
didn't get anywhere and so when he did
was collected a lot and that stuff that

84
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,280
they're moving out all these chemicals

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,130
getting a giant bucket went to the
corporate headquarters and blasted

86
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,000
everywhere just blasted in all the arts
is a good

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,229
and in the company really could say that
it was harmless because I

88
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,770
they had to shut down their offices and
getting all its plans on

89
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,549
its own this way he was able to enact
social change on acting as an anonymous

90
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,890
agent

91
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,539
this was our this is back in nineteen
seventy and there's a there's a really

92
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:27,080
excellent I'm interview with him

93
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,900
19 you when we get home mood after that
1973 there is a group called the

94
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,120
lavender Panthers

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,260
at this time there was a lot of gay
bashing and

96
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,919
there is a reference to was openly gay
which is very rare for nineteen ninety

97
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:41,469
degrees to

98
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,830
story today and he ran a gay community
center that was vandalized

99
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,539
me call the police the police didn't do
anything except to tell the Vandals that

100
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:50,800
use this num

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,890
and the guy got beat up really badly and
so after that he was

102
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,310
million hits per line obvious reasons
and he wanted to make a page

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,800
on ball from the box in the black
panthers he said the bike and there sir

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,729
involved in protecting their community
me was you the same and so we found in

105
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:05,810
the lavender and there's

106
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,550
which is a group that really started
bringing this idea that citizens

107
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,260
keep its role as a group patrolling
neighborhoods not as police the Justice

108
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,070
citizens

109
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,370
and stop crimes and they see them than
time also did an organism

110
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,870
and then which is really excellent
jacket is a nine and

111
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,330
meaning Curtis lower founded the
guardian angels

112
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,789
essentially the same thing slander
Panthers but without

113
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,729
a down a political point were predicting
any particular sexual orientation

114
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,409
just Dec 29 everyone in New York at this
time the

115
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,540
near transit police were on strike
because they were getting paid as much

116
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,639
as cops that where the drawing on the
street level

117
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,810
and so they went on strike and although
some ways we're being protected

118
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,810
and that's in the dining he'll start in
the desert join the subway systems and

119
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,060
stopping crime so they saw them

120
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,729
so now this is really connected all
these were different %uh different

121
00:06:58,729 --> 00:06:59,870
events different

122
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,949
flashpoints and it wasn't until 1980
when a man named

123
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,810
Knight Rider we don't know his real name
I wrote a book called how to be super go

124
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,940
this is in 1980 and he said all these

125
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,560
people and others are realizable
undertaking this idea that comic book

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,669
and their using anonymity to shape rule
that world events and an act

127
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,650
actual social change on 3rd a really
great but there's only one happiness

128
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,440
distance

129
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,189
ASO so you find one your you wanna go
home

130
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:35,129
so essentially there was a lot of
communication with people cuz they were

131
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:35,860
so rare

132
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,739
are they didn't really talk to each
other they just did their own individual

133
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:39,489
missions

134
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:42,800
all around the country no around the
world and it wasn't until

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,719
unique in on that really change things
on the unit change the real issue for a

136
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,080
movement the same way to change the
hacker movement

137
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,719
mom into things happened Tom I think
both attackers and with really super

138
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:54,229
heroes

139
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,169
number one the the good that came with
this was there was much more

140
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,188
communication

141
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:01,219
there's information sharing there's
teamwork do good people to collaborate

142
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,009
on projects that were too big for any
one single person

143
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,189
to work on and if anyone came up with a
solution they could share with everyone

144
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,740
else which means that

145
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,789
there's a huge group trying to solve
these problems

146
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,449
and not just the person each having to
me the same mistakes over and over again

147
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,119
with information sharing you can let
them once give alms a humane legal right

148
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:19,639
to the

149
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,490
the successful for so this this Apple
the Packers & with me lets the burners

150
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,039
and in a late 90's early 2000's

151
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,179
but there's also the flip side in this
on the bad

152
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,240
then was both actors in with real answer
is there's people

153
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,669
that will pretend to know something when
they really don't and so the real issue

154
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,919
bermudas was kinda

155
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,980
people that would role play and say they
were down did all the things in the

156
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,790
religion

157
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,730
in is very dangerous for these people to
give a nice to others and say oh yeah I

158
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,660
put my mind in this this and this

159
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,750
and on is dis up a drug dealer you
really have to get their face

160
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,329
and push them around unfortunately this
did happen there's a guy that

161
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,089
that said this on to a teenager and said
go to confront drug dealers yet to get

162
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:02,910
their face

163
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,469
and so the teenager did this and down
again in the states

164
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,720
on then lifted and the situation

165
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,779
but obviously om

166
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,620
actors and media always farmer the room
non-unanimous

167
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,380
they say they're Mon

168
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,019
so in line this time I don't the fact
that there was all this new

169
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:24,860
communication

170
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,449
all these years knew that each other
there's now 350 people in the states

171
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:31,290
around the world to say that there's a
better than one Mike Brown

172
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,500
and so it's like okay how do you
separate the people

173
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,819
that are baking and the people that are
real you meet up in life

174
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,689
and so this was started by a group
called Super doesn't understand actually

175
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:42,380
wearing

176
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,170
the shirt started by a film student at
Columbia

177
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,469
manheim hazardous with his friend and
almond and already was get super heroes

178
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,819
to

179
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:54,469
need in real life and this is worked out
really great they didn't really want to

180
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,009
focus on

181
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:58,389
prime fine they're they're more focused
on sharing activism and they're known

182
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,360
a non-profit so they have to stay with
the controversial stuff

183
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,000
on though after this after people
started

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,930
meeting up that's when the New York
initiative I was founded

185
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,439
there's for members right now we move
from all over the country

186
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:18,610
on and decided on something and decided
to do something

187
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,449
that would be positive and take these
grannies it is community

188
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:26,100
had the militia group meeting and take
them to the next level

189
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,420
and down we get handed over to Sat to
talk a little bit more about the new

190
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,279
york initiative

191
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,420
and your own himself

192
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,800
them I am

193
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,870
other yes the rooms rooms on rent for
bball Kenyan

194

we saws a problem mean the at the seam

197
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,699
and this into something that ends with
the new admissions

198
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:03,150
just the beginning next month which
people you

199

200
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,580

202

martial arts training in the field

206

just beware monument take a look at
what's going on

211
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,029
arm I really would suggests them

212
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,510
if you wanna be a comedian teams really
involving you

213
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,040
no needs we need our is a speaking to
the people home

214
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,329
live there and from relationships and

215
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,620
Houston what it is that the word on the
street is very powerful

216
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,040
you can do reconnaissance missions and

217
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,579
huh observant

218
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,330
and see if I mmm-hmm pleases high-crime

219
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,180
however nothing is more valuable than
the speed in the people and Anderson

220
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,860
what has happened

221
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,920
me

222
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,680
as far as year think sports

223
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,870
it's very simple to the gym

224
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,880
with CNBC Hey

225
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,809
its there's something home jus

226
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:43,900
yes

227
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,900
sons

228
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,120
can be formed into

229
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,220
best it is stab him

230
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,670
ands I don't wanna be morose

231
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,040
but the reality is if you're gonna get
yourself in the situation is a

232
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,279
strong possibility that you can run up
against some

233
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,680
my and mobile enough for me

234
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,740
done we have a member that has Mon

235
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,610
a bulletproof vest but also you need is
your wits about you when you don't wanna

236
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,380
antagonize rescue and

237
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,010
a situation the best Mon

238
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,319
possible vice against anyone is to learn
conflict resolution

239
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,540
aside from knowing how to defend
yourself it's not

240
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,130
always the best policy to go into a
situation and

241
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,820
trade him buat

242
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,180
through it I am its I think that my
aunts

243
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,550
would be the last resort when you can

244
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,050
said there is much to say for conflict
resolution

245
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,190
disclaims gym

246
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,310
the 2001 image in home be you

247
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,300
the near future developer tools for
people call this a very extensive

248
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,470
martial arts training on Thursday worth
it

249
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,590
on the nearest AT&T %uh and BEF

250
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,580
I broke my arm recently not in the field
arts I had minimum think I'll

251
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,030
ironically make you deal with drama
emergencies because I am

252
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,310
had some emergency burn before then we

253
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,830
we did everything to be as safe as
possible to as much better voting office

254
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,220
had much much training

255
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,890
in Aus others understand and were sent
to training

256
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,530
either in difference thousands of
defense for parkour are

257
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,890
many min I'm inflation and moderate
readings

258
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,080
it's certainly good to have on right
knowledge base in its

259
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,420
could only say as safe as possible so
what are the things that I wanna talk

260
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,230
about were different types admissions

261
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,260
I call these different concentrations on
these are things that have been done in

262
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,040
the past

263
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,620
mines that have this going out mine
expecting something

264
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,890
happened that you could involve them by
yourself with and

265
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,030
make a positive change it's better to
have %uh

266
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,480
something some kind goal to go on
there's a guy named

267
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,070
superhero these names you know even
Burnett

268
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,480
any has an analogy that he calls other
not the problem

269
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,930
and Tom his ideas that are a lot of
people

270
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,840
my neighbors going into this somehow
think that if you walk around all night

271
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,740
with the mass

272
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,010
that it somehow gonna be more exciting
than walking around Adams

273
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,420
in reality we're going to see what you
wearing your still just as likely that

274
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,970
burned a crime which is

275
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,750
fairly well and he's moving just make
the point

276
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,540
I'm ones from anonymity Zimmer's number
you reside in

277
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,939
I don't know outgoing mass in fact
movement

278
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,149
governorship my fans but

279
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,709
it's really only marginal gone
plainclothes originally where

280
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,159
I to recover under merging

281
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,279
just one suggesting goblins

282
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,569
this is not this is the new address is

283
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:01,029
modelers in on but yeah I'm

284
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,779
on the only public member of the
nearness to the other three are

285
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,399
anonymous and have code names on

286
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,689
and it's like that for a reason I wanna
members has a lot of contacts

287
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:17,478
and he wouldn't be getting the
information that he gets down

288
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:21,439
criminals essentially if they knew what
he was a bomb

289
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,719
and so that's that anonymity is very
important moon

290
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,329
so summer concert missions I wanna talk
about the dome just go out Tom

291
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:35,649
without a plan you're not gonna many
things can be very boring for you when

292
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:36,399
you're really not gonna

293
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,119
if enact any has social change for
helping one

294
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:43,779
so on one thing that people started
doing is home with our reach

295
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,849
non it's an issue in a large part in the
world is

296
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:50,829
and even in the United States even
though we tell ourselves with the

297
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:53,829
richest nation the world we still have a
very large problem with poverty and

298
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:54,579
homelessness

299
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:59,789
and so when the best people aren't you
home is that reaches an infinite us and

300
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:03,729
Vancouver and essentially he makes up

301
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:07,360
alive sandwiches will get medical
supplies you gain

302
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,879
on models and water and when he gets
anything

303
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:14,029
mom that a homeless person would need is
done

304
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,638
care package any hands-on as much money
as possible nom

305
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,750
any also get information from people
he's able to you

306
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,859
I am have all those eyes and ears on the
street

307
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,059
mom and he's able then to help on and in
many cases keep them alive

308
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,610
mom so I don't miss nixon as a line
respect

309
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,860
everyone that knows parliamentarians are
they doing %um

310
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,289
a spin on this than I did on is wanna
call travel outreach

311
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:45,730
other NYMEX floor I really like explain
tunnels on

312
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,789
under bridges now turns in the bin been
insights and in doing this

313
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:53,119
on I found most people the first time it
was under this bridge

314
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,080
and their wisdom this fireplace and he's
for guys around in their cooking

315
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,149
are and had matches up inside now looks

316
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:04,690
in looked like he was ten thousand years
ago

317
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,330
during the games very home

318
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,639
and so the next nine and one in exile in
Iran

319
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:16,169
I run supplies and I started exploring
other bridges this was in Austin Texas

320
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,200
and love the most people are very

321
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,580
home dissatisfied with her multi-region
Austin

322
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,189
it's very minimal and the homeless
outreach

323
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,529
feels like they don't have to try
because the restive taxes is extremely

324
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:30,779
anti homes

325
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:34,549
and so virtually if your taxes you
permitted except Austin if you don't

326
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:35,690
have anywhere to stay

327
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,369
and so says they believe in leading
complete

328
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,678
they it's been less than 1 people
they're homeless

329
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,110
are satisfied with that they're getting
and so they live in these different

330
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,590
drives throughout the city

331
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,709
artist only the museum

332
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,900
model get standard more freedom

333
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,210
and so I we've got to these tribes that

334
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,580
no one is going out to you no one is
interacting with there's no

335
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,110
large organization out to help them look
even look for them in the aware that

336
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,460
their

337
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,610
existing and handle things like food and
water medical supplies and blankets

338
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,540
which can be really important Aston the
weather can drop

339
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,820
and since it's 106 degrees every other
day in the year no one has been gets a

340
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,530
little freeze and people that I'm soon

341
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,280
that's something that a is important you
know trying to to do that would

342
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,440
now in an era pra mim

343
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,429
nothing then I was interested in is for
corn on the cob getting up to that one

344
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,049
next few months on by owner

345
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,280
got a place in this is some things that
I've done where I'll

346
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,320
either be honored on a rooftop or
somewhere mom

347
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,629
thanks in part we're getting better at
it but at the same time keeping anime

348
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,490
stream

349
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,559
and is give me any activity as long as
you have some actually did you

350
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,700
so you can watch the streets but also
not just be disguised in around the

351
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,520
conspicuous

352
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,450
mine is also well as boring ninety doing
stuff

353
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,880
any private investigator results in tell
you that home

354
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,100

359

on these other and it's been a

360
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,690
consummation so I definitely heard that

361
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,540
no one %um up there if you work on
submissions but I think before that not

362
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,110
south when it's not about

363
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,150
concept that the two like

364
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,140
do with him up with with denim see

you

367
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,610
they did not communism there's all these
different come with conditions

368
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,049
conventions and an idealized was wanted
there was a convention just for people

369
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:53,549
that

370
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:58,220
are 10 people these could be just thing
on civilians they can be

371
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,160
soldiers the Betz giving doctors that
firefighters and police officers

372
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,260
be social workers on anyone home

373
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,820
the 10 get together on do that so that's
something that

374
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,499
world in organizing the gym

375
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:16,529
also no more organizations nursing home

376
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,610
to home a lot of times the room

377
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,820
moon

378
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,149
marked

379
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,290
miss team

380
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,870
didn't

381
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,790
bongo drums need help with funding
however wonder

382
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,658
the kingdom maybe the my servers
together

383
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,030
come up with

384
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,970
strategies and not just on for funding
but also with

385
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,770
home

386
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,690
their purposes in mind

387
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,320
mind

388
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,120
that's good

389
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,750
you

390
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,270
missions team

391
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,470
is certainly something on I noticed an
arsonist special in Brooklyn there's so

392
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,539
much bureaucracy

393
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,169
with things on its its seems like

394
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:02,539
them any large organization is very
difficult you get things done especially

395
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,649
the government

396
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:07,510
but even if they're even if their
operation even if their nonprofit and I

397
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,799
just seems

398
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,210
unwielding and one of the things that
was brought to light recently was

399
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,610
something called on the NYPD teams

400
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,549
article non meet in the fifth issue
Village Voice

401
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:21,730
them

402
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,690
not do it

403
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,730
you know everyone's with them

404
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,610
there was police officer I'm has been TV

405
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,020
more calls yeah

406
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,129
moms multi-year hands was discovered is
that

407
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,420
specifically we first present with a
kiss with recently that other

408
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,380
bomb

409
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,820
the release forms are due in San as well
New York area there are under reporting

410
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,030
prime sessions robberies and more
violent crimes

411
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,410
and they're also on Palin's the numbers

412
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,810
with more something for us just makes
this is six looked like New York City's

413
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,879
in secrecy

414
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,310
in fact it's not I'm you know guiliani's
lot

415
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,270
for the city but currently the there is
still no

416
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,500
a lot of crime

417
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,110
there's an herb garden people we know im
discouraged actually from filing

418
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,250
robbery mars and this is months away
once again

419
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,399
soon

420
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:27,259
the movie issue the Village Voice the
NYPD teams

421
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:30,570
specifically regarding 81st precinct

422
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,179
more so if you who this reason to

423
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,029
morning

424
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,230
to be home an activist them

425
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,879
I'm really wanting to use the word
real-life superhero just mean wants to

426
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:44,840
help my community

427
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,470
yugos year Police Department of
Community Affairs Office

428
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,070
and may not be the reception menu
monsoon that's just something didn't

429
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:59,070
seem

430
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,760
so essentially in this environment where
the police are trying to help their

431
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,440
patting the numbers to me that looked
like there's a lotta love

432
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,760
really pay fences and their under
wearing

433
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,379
heavy vince's in this way it's very
politically say

434
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,200
verbal the police chief and former home

435
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,500
vermeer for anyone in government is a

436
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,800
look %uh statistically New York City is
the safest other

437
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,170
any big city United States were in fact

438
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,520
darn those are based on reports where we
know now that

439
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,990
at least one precinct and probably most
in them were

440
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,860
fudging the numbers in line about it so
probably no new york city can have the

441
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,350
highest crime rate

442
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,470
in a safe because we just don't have an
actor reports

443
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:51,170
so this is an issue that's just New York
City corrupt you can happen to the

444
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,720
any organization in the world and that's
way

445
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,240
while the real issue for home

446
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,490
started on in the state spread to other
countries

447
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,490
so then it spread

448
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,140
I think throughout the state saddam
primitive you from the United States

449
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,430
others most likely someone active in
your statement if you live in another

450
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,220
country

451
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,880
others there might be someone active in
your entrance its release them

452
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,370
only get back to some other concert
missions is a few more than I am

453
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,899
that I think would be

454
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,470
well received on the next one especially
on

455
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,730
the next show biz really great because
they had the art exhibit

456
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,779
and it's very pro or and I think that's
important because

457
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,309
are distancing societies in ways that no
other profession

458
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:42,769
really is keeping love doing and I that
he was traded

459
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:45,960
there's that miss you support and
respect for your

460
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,710
dimes meaning and one kinda more than I
really really like

461
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,100
is 150 or I think it's really amazing

462
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,620
were like these people and %um and

463
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,690
my respect that I am do not respect
people

464
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,700
that used tagging in use DVD to mark
territory

465
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,809
to mark territory different game what is
no drugs

466
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,120
and so one thing that I started doing 9
Kansas City

467
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,289
was removing on its

468
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:18,840
illegal to spray paint over it it going
which is what I started doing but

469
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,600
without the kids illegal because you can
get spray on

470
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,230
remover and so using that you can spread
on

471
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,429
are within five minutes you can scrub it
off with the with like still with

472
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:29,450
something like that

473
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,250

well over a hundred times on for
different I'm organizations

479
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:55,169
so I'll definitely recommend that

480
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:58,720
but of course with that you have to
respect artists you have to respect

481

genuine graffiti art and you should not

in bomb just because she changed clothes

531
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,129
so aren so that was really born

532
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:51,830
even though it if it seems silly you
this is done

533
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,600
just changing after taking a perspective
on your approach to something really

534
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,279
basic

535
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,580
not make a really huge minimal change in
town

536
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,970
know the person we talked about business
extreme he's on California

537
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,350
well mister extreme is concerned about
is different missing persons

538
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,549
and how we see missing person posters
and its

539
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,779
either like a blurry picture with
features like faded

540
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,309
rained on and it looks like it's been a
while since I believe I'm the person the

541
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:18,870
not

542
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,480
I'll what are these I did not for three
weeks I call

543
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,590
%uh the detective to ask if the founder
and he didn't know what I was not known

544
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,000
so I just felt by deadly I am

545
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,909
I definitely feel for him understand why
he would feel helpless with this

546
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:37,909
and so he does is he takes those those

547
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:42,179
pictures on from was born posters you
make the whole new

548
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,379
missing poster that his are

549
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:48,200
more engaging and eye-catching in
something that you actually can't look

550
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,000
away from

551
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,179
new makeup 100 cities and yes Bligh
getting tired

552
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:56,070
neighborhood in this way mom instead it
happened is boring

553
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,799
missing poster missing person poster
that no one pays attention to you

554
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,570
he'd read something that is engaging
with the community and create something

555
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,470
penetrate the situation where it's more
likely the names in person to be found

556
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,539
survivors that for for the work that he
does

557
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:15,149
another person is war yeah he's another
Canadian

558
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:19,389
he's a private detective and he doesn't
wear a mask arcade or

559
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:24,039
on does any leaders you know the
dismembered roles but his main mission

560
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,309
is to you offer detective services to
people for free

561
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,450
and so some will have a knee-jerk i'm
happier than if they feel like the

562
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,279
police are getting involved in

563
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,919
inasmuch as they should be they can go
to him and he will do the detective work

564
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,460
for free and hopefully

565
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,909
on and lovely get some justice for them

566
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:47,309
so that's another that's another concert
mission that's been on the moon

567
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:51,139
the last 1i think we'll probably be most
appropriate mom

568
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:54,929
for hacker conference which is on the
purely tenable missions

569
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:59,309
there's there's people in the community
don't ever go out on patrol

570
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:02,369
their sole purpose is what's called
support and supporting

571
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:06,279
commoner for anyways there's a min names
are Stephen King he

572
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,639
I am even with me but he or know you
made these

573
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:13,090

574
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,679

friends over the pending move all

575
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,789
they want and need has arisen
environmental disaster

576
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:24,770
it was possible to put military has
hands them

577
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,090
questions were easy and so his own me
these

578
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,480
would you really great over TT and means
a lot

579
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,610
to do CPR that's really good for this
and it's also great for

580
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,300
war

581
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,310
it's not be harmed they need them it's
also

582
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,460
on it's also good for reading a mines
I'll

583
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,660
one-time I am I got mine

584
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,160
show the bookmark an attack me from home

585
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,790
I mean in a breeze moneyline and I know
I would have been really really miss

586
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,520
that many

587
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,600
Adam needs so

588
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,740
even those whose team had not heard from
with me he did something that was very

589
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,720
helpful

590
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,610
mom to the patrol other words and
commissions on

591
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,740
there's and gaining victim in victim is
a lot better

592
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,150
other hardware hacker an electronics
expert than I am

593
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,950
and noms we're working on a live really
consecutive years

594
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,150
when I do that I put together it's not
the company star

595
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,380
and the stars in LED units 500 min break

596
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,400
home that's about 10 egg whites about
five times brighter than military

597
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,240
flashlight

598
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,930
I blinding literally minding live I had
when I

599
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,730
mine as you would you would have to
close your eyes would not be able to

600
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,380
view its

601
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,850
and so with your losses they are you
cannot carry

602
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,810
pepper spray without license to carry
pepper spray on

603
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,899
you can carry weapons mom and I figured
this would be a great non-lethal weapon

604
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,960
and no way can never hurt anyone

605
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,200
will be very effective in my own
congregation and so

606
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,080
I strapped this to you a backpack are
working press the button on

607
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,730
and when someone without taking out
something that's gonna look like it's

608
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,260
gonna be a goner weapon against touch my
chest

609
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,339
and have attention and that's %uh nothin

610
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,500
desirable as well this is understands
the

611
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,379
your presence these women in town mom

612
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:19,649
so nothing that victim did was you but
in appointments movie found is that

613
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:22,649
these polycarbonates are pretty much
staff room

614
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:25,969
we threw everything we could at that

615
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,679
PC polycarbonate the only thing that
made it through was signing

616
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,470
before that we tried just about any kind
and one on checked or sharp object

617
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,970
to get you any it realistic welcome

618
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,389
that they can also be heating up are you
very carefully

I am says something like that I am

630
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,970
victim is not someone that is going to
go on the field on

631

know people that are going on the last
kinda

633
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,630
people that help with technology or
what's called an operator

634
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,369
horrible and what they do is they say
the computer while someone is on field

635
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:49,760
in a person can have either a Bluetooth
earpiece and can be in contact with

636
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,270
someone

637
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,070
that has access the internet so they
don't have to bother phone or something

638
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,250
to look something up

639
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,680

640
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,460
finding years hospital Point Police home

641
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,020
looking a bit by simply you sees
suspicious up

642
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,130
cars and even with the blatantly there's
so many things

643
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,570
are we taking it for granted but its
it's amazing what you can do you have

644
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,710
your many computer

645
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,960

to somewhere

646
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,359
