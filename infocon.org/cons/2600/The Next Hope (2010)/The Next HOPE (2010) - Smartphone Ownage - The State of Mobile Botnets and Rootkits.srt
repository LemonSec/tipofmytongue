1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,240
is the I can talk North smaller room

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,220
something we're also one hour late and
the main change making mayor is the

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,880
telephone play near talk

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,230

I'll 8 p.m.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,010
and the way a reason why we did that was
a let's meet was issues at all space for

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,949
the social engineering

8
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:25,960

final say on schedule that's in

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,079

okay I'll

65
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,530
this big section here is basically a
should be an hour for the

66
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,060
360 and second edition 3rd edition CB 6e
is the

67
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,720
one made are most Motion and Nokia
phones in the last maybe three if

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,010
eight years or whatever need to fix
years and series 7 63 addition is like a

69
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,830
new version has more security without

70
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,979
artificially this layout we see mostly
attributed the rest is is is jungle and

71
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,760
windows in

72
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,380
so forth that actually matches leon fast
smart words

73
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,620
sales worldwide general pretty much

74
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,020
I mean dissolution up what's been
affected with to

75
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:53,020
rate so I'll

76
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,789
other platforms like I Android and
iPhone ever had as many sales is this a

77
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,250
your Java phone to your Symbian phones
in your Windows Phone from

78
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,920
but most useful in general so you will
see as much power on that chart

79
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,610
but thats pretty much real sample scene
while they're gone customers reading

80
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,000
from

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,130
actual kitchens things it actually
looked at the neck she applied

site okay so

88
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,410
yeah this is a chart basically for for
comparison of

89
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,690
up now we're between PCs and mobile
devices mobile phones

90
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,410
what can we do have basically have got
road and get viruses get

91
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,520
with you know what espy worked pretty
much

92
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
everything you see on a PC you see on a
mobile phone example

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,570
all those thanks we're not going to get
rid of it and you don't have got

94
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,340
the balkan will be seen after real stuff
we will be talking about

95
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,480
watch possible the blue chips mobile
phones

96
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,010
sorry can she might not fit to

97
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,580

okay this is the thing with arrows in
pictures 10

102
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,460
yeah okay right this is so the life
cycle

103
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,510
mobile our on any time in its new
platform to go to a source in cycle

104
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,010
the CRT cycle where prayer up skilled
researchers and

105
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,169
on our authors in other people who know
what they're doing

106
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,310
figure out ways to pick you were in your
Prof concept the they'd learned the

107
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,540
platform beastly learn the

108
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,520
API's it was possible to get away with
only thing up CRT section are from there

109
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,550
it really goes to

110
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,400
far a section where you have the review
section you notice all the books aka

111
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,070
like a river

112
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,080
yet but that's basic descriptive cycle

113
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,930
that the stage in the cycle were in
somebody's come over to be like a

114
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,870
like 2984 with those other out seem to
ours even so much come up with something

115
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,060
major example and other people feel
lipstick to socially provide analytical

116
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,800
changed a few variable names change a
few strings and you get like

117
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,240
basically ok doesn't variants of the
exact same and then

118
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,360
after you've got there after the your
original writers want to talk to the

119
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,820
actuation want to get used to it

120
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,970
what they do is spend say okay now let's
make some money from and FB the property

121
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,690
section is

122
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,850
rafik cycle you get used to the new
platform to learn what would you do with

123
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,100
it

124
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,390
you know how to avoid detection not and
you see how to make money

125
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,540
and its not true

126
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,410
to commonly and mobile our I mean

127
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,219

that's a lot a lot of love copies and
replacements

130
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,209
things of that nature should be
definitions

131
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:27,010

got service stings like a and

161
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,750

spinner finished the game affected a
good case

165
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,120
okay right once again same thing that

for the Tigers are for let's look at
something else

169
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,570
K small crack

170
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,810
I of for section mobile rootkit fees are

171
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,130
trumpeter speakers

172
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,579
okay so official yes come work on her
was now

173
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:58,320
really complex now are written for
Siemens c60 from

174
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,459
used by Russian film goes golfing handle
a lot or

175
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,920
he really slick new version every six
months or so axo

176
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,930
and you like the first few few few first
two variants

177
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,430
their really only notable thing about
them is that BP try to

178
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,800
basically other malware that was
existing at the time a great see on the

179
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,740
computer worm or some other

180
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,220
fires on the device it's ok if you know
where those files are let's go to sleep

181
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,360
it 1-1 home draw for talking to them
soundstage first diverge

182
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,690
any change it up in the next version see
getting more self-protection supervision

183
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,850
features

184
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,300

I want to go to track Guyana myself

187
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,910

188
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,439
risks wasn't quite area but declined
again

189
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,650
how Siam on non-food sided it had

190
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,449
almost everything from could accept
actually give you more actions against

191
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:03,040
since it was just corner to provide all
the other features Protection Division

192
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,089
only six

193
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,190
we have interject

194
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,510
okay info check was almost the same
thing for Windows

195
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,280
mobile so you have a complex my word it
does whole bunch of things to do

196
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,680
protective shell it from someone on a
young memory card so can we use old soul

197
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,040
15 also did something really interesting
to produce alter the

198
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,199
after a midseason you now did you
silently install

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,050
family in Stoneleigh at least a dollar
from a server capture actually was

200
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,320
inactive a time we got to sample city
shut down whenever the control serv a1

201
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,150
so we never actually got detective work
of on from

202
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,250
but he was the same kind of thing so for
something being a precursor to recruit

203
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,000
chief

204
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and then on Windows Mobile a precursor
product

205
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,130
should be actual kicks yes

206
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,290
blunt pick shovel in excellent okay that
got to overlook a divisive easier on the

207
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,579
next round with that

211
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,700
device was

212
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,310
so recently a team at Rutgers sixes

213
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,490
a picture at all be put together a
puncture

214
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,700
for Linux on for local kernel modules
for a for Linux

215
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,839
to puncture sorry coming up here

216
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,570
I yeah they perform a bunch attacks home

217
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,560
rights under recently when they went
with da open local oversee some other

218
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,260
kind of an extra weight on the phone

219

410
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,340
latest version of the Nokia phone to
having been running on them it was more

411
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,760
much more secure than

473
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:25,929
I miss over the weather for us for first
whether this was an app released

474
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,159
on the Android Market so it's like okay
to rebuild I could do that to go to the

475
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,440
weather underground website

476
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,800

478
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:38,560
a traitor to the page on whether I got a
culture within the local area

479
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,260
awesome to write they have a whole bunch
of conduct this is a two written by dr.

480
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,030
two issues that 2.2 additional ex-lax
BBC fondly research

481
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,290
so they said okay let's text you can
make it there reasoning behind what if

482
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,639
we can make a year

483
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:55,139
Obama and and sending out on a good
legitimate skies original

484
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:58,810
at and you can happen make some whether
feast was the Coptic

485
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,678
cleaning shop would never get lost take
your writing your phone number

486
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,540
doing it md5 hash in San over to their
server damn know anyone really

487
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,849
hash but he was busy proved costly I can
do that

488
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,980
Barack be awesome in another version
weather is bad monkey

489
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,990
you should never actually publicly
released fun Easter

490
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,520
more fancy full-featured real but
webster's bad monkeys acted a little bit

491
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,070
more

492
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,349
autograph architecture yeah

493
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:30,570
to commence and they did multi-platform
actors and also an iPhone

494
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,908
but since they were doing but next even
actually putting should be

495
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:37,919
iPhone App Store or the Android Market
they said that put into an altered after

496
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,599
party markets like slightly on Android

497
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:46,450
CD on iPhones you could you needed a
jailbroken phone iPhone

498
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,530
and you can do it you can install what
you like if you set ascending for

499
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,149
2.0 applications in in in in your
settings

500
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:58,200
so bad monkey version grabs your

501
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,060
back to grab it into the computer
commands like I sending emails out

502
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,330
to them spamming from distributing all

503
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,389
lasts a bit and I'll service attacks and

504
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:12,480
best Avant the client on I think I felt
at least

505
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,010
to provide diverse shell from soon

506
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:20,290
gonna to nice nice thing me John you
check the weather in

507
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:26,460
New York forever whatsoever boom be on
your phone and whatever else you got

508
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,899
I was kinda think it was just approved
got to shake it can be done

509
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:33,960
and it can be done but not necessarily
on anything that isn't

510
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,330
stock phone yet to close it

511
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,439
what can be done on stocks this is the
other one

512
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,340
they could watch strap and it could
strap conditions were perfect gotta go

513
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,590
biatch on over 100

514
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,520
security now up he did research on

515
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,980
how do how do I put together the piece
you need to work on actually old

516
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,859
takeover phone and maintain control
thing and partially giving

517
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:05,099
this app was initially accept this isn't
like a little on the phone

518
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:09,020
social chat application is just a
regular and reduction to prepare legally

519
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,060
and get downloads files from sheesh

520
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,480
control server says OK we have

521
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,149
actual and bioenergy from meaning
shellcode

522
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:23,030
export yet 1x what for doctor kept and
affects

523
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,230
affected and we fought for the passion I
think

524
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,490
pic I think ninety percent of on actions
not really effective you can actually

525
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,379
stick to go anywhere

526
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:34,419
but you be built things on the academics
come

527
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,810
you can of course update echoed because
saddam

528
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,510
bikies crews have downloaded from boring
up businesses who track

529
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,899
it's ok you to minimal coming up to the
turtle an application a game or

530
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:45,690
something whatever

531
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,690
he said let me get when I preview it was
right before the Eclipse came out right

532
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,050
so you can okay

533
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,480
after people come down here I do you
know second its but your comments

534
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,270
cents per basic you actually get down on
it and overtime guessing

535
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,290
who said this is a horrible actor has
one or 2 pictures

536
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,889
I could wrap officially granted just
from beyond the trailer

537
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:10,720
poster something good user app go

538
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,760
he still got about to head out works

539
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,859
exhorting social engineering action
targets

540
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:20,240
p the users should have your system
itself

541
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,690
the point that this whole big experience
what to say

542
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,700
you can get portion of what you do your
infrastructure for your body

543
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,530
on the phone already you can come from
have some process of it on the phone

544
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,250
with me so everyone

545
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,200
and he was in the market think Google
pulled ask him to believe how people

546
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,810
react

547
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,590
and then the user mode thomas also
return only for App Center

548
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,649
its old in the attic to basically
nuclear

549
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:49,460
new key applications you can't get any
more and if you have installed it again

550
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,010
nice but because few days until

551
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,419
think to the PP talk at a rate for
get-go

552
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:00,080
was arce believe summer got some

553
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,669
at a comer con I'll which was about a
month or so ago

554
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,070
maybe last tells you to run your

555
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,250
yeah some really recently right

556
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,369
until then nobody jotted down to know
thanks

557
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,020
but of course it was in the real target
attack and which phones you can really

558
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,070
get the same

559
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,230
reach you can would with a PC or Windows
when

560
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,399
I mean it 60

561
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:33,399
texan of Graham here

562
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,990

564
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,500
possibly could be done and everybody
have a question about anything sir

565
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,929
but feasible

566
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,619
heat up on medication for a little bit
had you know executives that have found

567

department

576
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,230
lockout device in control the whole
lotta aspects vice

577
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,330
you're not really gonna face murder with
a placard because

578
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,660
you can really lot of things down iPhone

579

for the executive special

582
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,780

other places that's important you can't
just think people's

617
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,000
permission not I'm actually gotten out
that does have been there to site I

618
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,220
figured it's called exactly

619
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,680
think iPhone from Homer something

YouTube login as a listing in an hour
hosts file don't you

621
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,869

sure that the after

622
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:16,880
my iphone 4 and give exact name and then
clicks

623
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,510
but yeah but actual katzenbach max

624
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,220
only be seen here but if present there's
been any real

625
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,480
anything they've gone out there to the
iPhone

626
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,480
market App Store process yet

627
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,020
but they are could be many other privacy
infringing application

628
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,450
at heart attack

629
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,400
have you seen any attacks on me go for
me mo

630
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,630
on the Linux for for Nokia and I
hundreds

631
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,640
you members site about the Rutgers
University object that team is actually

632
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,509
working on

633
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,109
or their talking forty all the work
leave called on the open local

634
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:57,400
open platform towards the N 900

635
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,760
obviously distribution for the nine
hundred for our

636
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,650
the new york alone now for more mobile
backtracks offered Hadassah

637
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,650
aircrack its budget on that distribution

638
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,090
was on the richly on an open local phone
Dave there now

639
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,640
according to the end I heard also I
think after Lisa sometime this month

640
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,839
before def come

641
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,900
next week the search for the claiming

642
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,620
but they've done all the work to to try
for the guy was over over to

643
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm assuming base actual me more than

644
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,690
Linux me go is the culmination of
politics mobile and I believe

645
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,870
me more together I think which model xx
quite a few mobile the next group

646
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,950
getting Intel one in 2001 with with with
Nokia's version of

647
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,960
still mix model ok

648
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,220
to third quite a few Islam on his mobile
is this a common

649
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,850
and I mean and they keep changing names
but yeah Tom

650
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,310
you say that a taxonomy I'll

651
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,190
it 22 you hear something about did get
somewhat

652
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,860
debut extra picnic John had mentioned
yes okay

653
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,120
we know there are a buncha pretty by
itself doesn't do anything myself

654
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,880
mediate me to do with myself but its
clinics of issue there are

655
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,560
our privilege escalation expect me not
to be factually correct using

656
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,299
on the phone and you said mobile phones
don't %ah

657
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,770
some mobile carriers in all manufactured
honestly afraid because

658
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,320
as often as same had to argue

659
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,030
Tour de bien anybody any any PC via

660
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,850
or server OS I cannot convict gonna
bring the same time

661
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,529
me anything REIT so you have to
potential for holes in

662
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,980
and people could be doing but anyone's
like a cartoon

663
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm not really it's actually dark that
many devices being sold in comparison to

664
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,280
you

665
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,230
your average life they're selling
millions of units iPhone

666
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,770
up 900 or similar not a minimum at

667
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,410
in the same range top because mimic for
Nokia top largest

668
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,230
exercise I was wondering

669
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,640
about non and jailbroken iPhones because

670
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,520
your talk seem to imply that they were
extremely secure that

671
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,120
basically to attacked and you would have
to go through Apple's

672
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,569
App Store and they probably whole you
but

673
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,290
do you expect to see arm people finding
a home ability

674
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,520
class if things aren't are secure in the
abstract the whole point up their gear

675
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,530
UK restrictions to not allowed access
certain things like

676
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,540
would allow you to put together a kid
not probably not gonna have to the

677
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,360
abstract but

678
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,690
things like stealing information like to
click to keep more cash successful from

679
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,810
public Epix began has only passers

680
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,420
sky-high mean on they can get to you
still but

681
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,610
actual something that elect him complete
only on your phone

682
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,230
not necessarily from the App Store good
unless you can find

683
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,420
gonna be on the phone which we've seen
in the past %ah

684
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,290
like attacking the mechanics are
concentrating on the iPhone you can

685
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:00,279
target got calm owner and trying dot com
last year contract

686
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,970
backup last year with the DD the city
feinstein

687
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,150
and from

688
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,550
thank you right to the end it defies the

689
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,750
from the doctor different techniques are
facing the Comcast Center

690
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,210
to be seeded with the internet would
with a wonderful night police are one

691
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,910
feel wanted DDoS but

692
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,710
assuming you you kept it up and not just
did just so you get boxer short

693
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,120
he at a conference because we don't have
a long time

694
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,310
world after bang for the buck Rodgers QB
strand

695
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:35,440
back tougher for dedicated tracker last
time and

696
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,450
possibly could find something but got
company theoretical

697
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:46,370
back to top sounded like a oh no we're
gonna die

698
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,290
two questions one of them was them and
slide you had for you guys are

699
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,250
collecting

700
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,700
a lot of power that was on phones how do
you generally find their

701
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,910
I mean it like it's be really obviously
have

702
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:01,540
our now know we actually that's fine
Siemens at large

703
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,860
its meaning so little soccer people see
okie stops Optix Aqua

704
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,550
things are working some things running
now Houston just simply was actually

705
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:08,930
pretty good

706
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,330
for me came originally from on cops
handles like a sound serious

707
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,190
that was the Stoppers for that there's a
community said okay we have a bunch due

708
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,340
to handle computer

709
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,170
we have passed manner reviews have
prosecutors they saw was running some

710
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,830
things are working well

711
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:28,120
a lot of these initials of victims were
common to work on IV detection

712
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,200
they showed up so I mean a lot of these
10 the shop they were trying too hard

713
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,940
and the other ones like come where you
didn't dispute in a while he's in it to

714
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,080
TV companies Awami make sure people know
the guys are very good in that

715
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,290
original mix mobile im cycle and all
that

716
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,130
pp 1-2 people know they've done some
because the clockwork

717
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,370
for the other others attack attack
60-yard 71

718
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,380
the the chinese want to see this sexy 11
not

719
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,380
looks a lot more target looks like they
don't want to know it all that one would

720
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,000
not have been

721
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,490
car message was sent to people meaning
customers come in and think something's

722
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,130
very wrong

723
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,270
on the clock and the other one was

724
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,440
is there any i mean being from tactic is
your brother ask is there any

725
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,930
development towards

726
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,290
any fires space fire warning things like
that for phone

727
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:18,920
I wasn't to talk um yeah I'm

728
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,880
62 X possible do it on the phone for
free we do things on my own long

729
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,530
various platforms like a months against
women because largest

730
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,660
I'll Windows Mobile become also there
had been

731
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,660
their high-profile their up and then
there are things like unlike for the

732
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,149
iPhone

733
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,690
attracting anyone's on for proper 21
from Apple for iPhone because I'm not

734
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,690
actually seen the

735
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,840
forget rootkits we don't have security
API for that allow us to do

736
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:49,690
but but yeah i mean there are price
coming out all the time it'd cost

737
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,260
on I'm just one then says you have to
catch like how big this isn't as for the

738
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,920
replacement for the phones

739
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,360
heard that comes under thing we don't
like to talk but I mean if you know how

740
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,260
the iPod is now looks for it

741
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,320
yet no we don't actually do the same
kind I think because

742
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,320
would mobile for Vice harder

743
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,940
honey pot makes sense on PC because you
have so much to space just remember you

744
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,440
have a

745
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,080
you can just put it under control she
did or VM whatever

746
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,560
on their phone or or even a user's phone
or complain about

747
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,930
P anniversary PC on on your phone

748
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,279
I mean all you could be sitting on
mobile device they have to be when to

749
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,400
stop to work

750
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,820
from the ground of on undetermined the
biggest device known as saying OK we

751
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,950
detect when we have to be simplified

752
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,940
know one thing:

753
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,570
sorry don't people put simulators for
the phones on in the IP space

754
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:45,020
have the carrier and use them as honey
pots okay you like a full similar

755
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,170
the other i mean the existing simulator
that was written by the

756
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,690
him a catcher's going on or something
non mobile hardware

757
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,000
our selection I Victor suck up into
actually likes you

758
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,250
handled the actual devices really their
that many

759
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,350
actual manufacture typeof see major

760
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,500
and mean the full Emily releasing

761
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,880
and aren't there things like littles you
know Little Snitch for example for the

762
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,690
Mac

763
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,660
tells you when you're opening a
connection to an unexpected location

764
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,379
some happens during and you down

765
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,950
it would be nice to have that for the
mobile platform although the you I might

766
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:26,160
be confused but I missus running all the

as a separate product he epic an account
but we're going to college %um

770
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,300
do the carriers look for since they
control those networks to look for

771
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:45,240
hygiene on the part of their clients and
when they see but activity they start

772
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,680
telling people about it conde monitored
during their work very closely so they

773
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,109
know when someone's inside

774
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,660

advertise like anything i mean

780

782
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,720

783
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,020
in an upcoming of and I'll talk to
people who've actually attacking

784
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,290
we talk to you but they will tell you
someone got never concede

785
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:31,340
we do box

786
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,180
as far as the honey pots how about Tom
Android for x86

787
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:40,089
have you played with that I you and
refer x264 and wait for the

788
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,100
except for texas Attorney yes their
support

789
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,040
to hear that %um %um you later that
front on various platforms

790
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,150
xxx both our

791
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,240
two different things one is the city's
QME running an arm so

792
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:58,730
it is the phone pretty much running on
on a piece of fasten actual device

793
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:02,080
I and the other one would be a poor
Texas I haven't seen I am i kno

794
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,980
I've heard it but I haven't actually
khalsa into again detective Justin

795
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,800
Duchscherer

796
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,010
ok patch actual and iPad actual

797
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:13,040
so not as much does help to

798
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,980
having a mixing you actually haven't had
it before like a Texas immunity good

799
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,660
tool

800
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,920
in between you two years ago we can
actually happy burgers on the phone

801
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,040
until then wasn't Sports first aid and
if they had the I think

802
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,080
Nokia purchased a korean and they've
reported

803
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,930
next time in a bit actually on it was a
lot of your technique asked

804
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,640
device issue what to do content
Environment Secretary okay

805
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,650
next you know what on the phone want you
to be a beacon

806
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,800
until recently wouldn't have the same
tools and they had determined

807
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,800
section 101 Anderson testing secured
because it a good product out the door

808
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,920
they can do the same kind of icing on a
bike is a cam anything else

809
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,740
actually went even T Mobile Money do you
want first came out

810
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,330
heading to release a full patch it took
like fifty megabytes like a one-week

811
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,460
and they have to do under week after
some DT over-the-air

812
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,710
just to Pacha Pacha initially mistook
want to be here

813
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:08,510
because browser bug timing it's not easy
for

814
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:12,190
for Falcons same thing need to be done
pretty much from many forgettable ever

815
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:12,820
gonna put in

816
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:19,820
when you build device and Africa fix
City

817
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:25,320
so I'm curious a to related things now
that

818
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,180
we've seen a lot on the PCs which are
are this autumn man in the middle

819
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:29,980
attacks

820
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,080
spoofing a trusted sources and at the
same time

821
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,680
arm web browser vulnerabilities and I'm
curious as to whether

822
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,620
this type of thing could be an alternate
our method of installing

823
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,880
mall where on the phone basically by
bypassing

824
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,720
the App Store altogether rider breaking
part of the browser which lets you

825
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,810
execute arbitrary code or

826
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,040
splashy done and on my front early unit

827
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,670
version wonder one point something or
whether videos versions

828
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:04,160
102 get exactly what it is you'd like to
be a couple to delete this is really I

829
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,299
think was

830
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,350
image file economic sense for the moment
there was a boner billion in like an

831
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,290
adult image file

832
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:13,900
and if they see you visit the Web site
in India in safari in

833
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,000
click the button and boom you're like a
to learn to jailbreak

834
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,750
the file city on their so it's
theoretically possible but

835
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,910
it's getting harder to do if you follow
the iPhone jailbreaking

836
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,200
team in a deft even do burgers

837
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,370
free fall to animate from the whole time
and they do fine for me

838
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:34,430
that allowed you to jailbreak but to not
be exported as common

839
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,560
people what you want to do not generally
on trading exploits

840
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,560
widespread also because ap

841
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,490
to work you think it's not as easy
because when the smaller

842
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,820
as soon as a jugar burgers release a
jailbreak I was gonna find I know what

843
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,380
went down a lot of cash

844
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,160
and you have a and you can start so you
you could kind of do it

845
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,290
and it's free it's technically possible
but relaxing it happen a lot of

846
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:04,070
from A to B is holding the iPhone and

847
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,830
okay sorry last minute nom we're not
seeing it as much

848
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:11,060
on the iPhone because I mean the closest
thing was just

849
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,259
happening in the comments and Eddi for

850
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,630
I Ciara sales every she

851
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,450
that attempts to preserve picture job
make it onto an entrepreneur

852
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:24,480
but nothing actually goes after reform
would say a non-monotonic

853
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,660
they don't really last as long and I'm
guessing you don't have to be very

854
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,430
targeted attack

855
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:32,010
not be from you class out because you
lose

856
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:35,360
talk to get it and then even harder to
see how can I use

857
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,350
economy sucks hunting I'll white with
canopies

858
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,370
level think there

859
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:47,350
but it's feasible

860
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:51,100
russians

861
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,400
okay thank you thank you very much
