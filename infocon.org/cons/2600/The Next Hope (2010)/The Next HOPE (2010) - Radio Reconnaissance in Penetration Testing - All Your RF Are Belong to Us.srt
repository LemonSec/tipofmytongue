1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,280
okay thank everybody for coming out
tonight

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,090
in

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,910
as a Noga thank 0 for coming out tonight

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,710
never gonna talk about ready
reconnaissance and penetration testing

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,350
a or all your RF are belong to us
throughout the talk

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,400
if anyone has any questions I am raise
your hand if I can see you

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,970
I are calling you repeat the question
and get answered

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,269
for certain me too many questions I
might have to be held to the end just to

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,829
you our

10
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:37,489
keep flowing along the deficit's going
along raise questions want us to be good

11
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:38,460
interactive

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,930
so four get started just the

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,019
brief synopsis about myself Matt nearly
some you may know me as I am bony

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,570
has a hand-off and the mantra profound
team at secure stage basically means I

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,050
run a grammatical hackers

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,590
that do variety a penetration tests my
real expertise

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,879
Wireless spent racin testing physical
security

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,229
security convergence which is basically
taking on

19
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,479
physicals your devices attached to him
onto the network will often hilarious

20
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,170
consequences

21
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,439
and then also into response

22
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,850
me doing security for about 10 years
before

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,570
getting into the consulting world I have
formed a Tsem team

24
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,420
at a fortune 200 company and this is
basically a group that when a rounded

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,390
box we being followed executives

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,829
make sure no one was bugging their
activities us what conference rooms

27
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,500
active thanks again very

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,630
RF intensive outside work to %ah
security stuff

29
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,030
a host to the security just as podcast
and a bunch of other guys I have some

30
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,850
stickers appear from a wanted looking
for new podcast check it out

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,030
one note it is filmed in a bar %uh

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,950
so as the night goes on to language
becomes more and more bar appropriate

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,220
so probably not going to listen to when
you have the kids in the car

34
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,020
I am but it's usually fun time also
wanted the cofounders of the Cleveland

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,920
lockpick group

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,659
been involved in like the community for
a while also been entry operator for

37
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,270
about 20 years now

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,329
a technician grain of highly recommend a
friend wants in a radial learn about

39
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,230
your theory

40
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,569
had to buy stuff and then not finally
though the radio up there is the first

41
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,590
really over hacked

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,000
the fisher-price guy talker
walkie-talkie and I was a kid got tired

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,250
a

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,370
via all those radios work on the same
frequency so

45
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,010
other kids in the neighborhood at the
same radio they could hear everything I

46
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,970
was saying they could

47
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,989
you know interference stuff so open a
parent had a

48
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,640
re to Adams they worked on a different
frequency problem with high legal from

49
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,959
the FTC point of view but had arm

50
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,610
and then basically return them so it
could be a operate on their own

51
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,629
frequency so them you my friends never
own private little

52
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:50,739
ready in act on so now on to the and me
to the talk

53
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,950
this picture here is a visual
representation

54
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,410
up the radio spectrum don't really need
to get the the general just a bit

55
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,549
from but it covers three killer hurts up
to 300 gigahertz

56
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,650
now the key here is in most penetration
tests

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,849
people are looking at really two areas a

58
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,519
the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum and the
5-yard spectrum Cir talking about

59
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,930
basically wifi here

60
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,629
a AVG possibly end up any other testers

61
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,429
but a pretty narrow scope maybe though
including Bluetooth but for the most

62
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,870
part they're they're missing a huge
spectrum

63
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,890
so what are some things I could be
missing during penetration tester just

64
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,840
look cities areas

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,049
you have garnered scarred radios

66
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,930
cordless phones wireless headsets

67
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,129
security cameras all sorts of other
things and take place in this area

68
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,420
they can be a interest to penetration
testers to people trying to gain access

69
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,480
to corporations

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,019
the general some real talk is

71
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:59,019
if I has your frequencies I will own you
before you get started just a couple

72
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,560
legal issues

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,709
I am for saying I am NOT a lawyer

74
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,260
are so you know anything I tell you here
be sure to run it by your legal counsel

75
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,909
first

76
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:15,150
to make sure no breaking the law first
big area know the wiretap laws in your

77
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,918
area be sure not to violate them

78
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,198
year for eggs so now the question

79
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,240
FF for example on in some states

80
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,479
I requires two-party consent record a
phone call so

81
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,050
unless both parties even sent have a
phone call recorded you could be

82
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,639
violating the wiretap law in that state

83
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,370
so depending on what you're doing in
terms of mantra transmissions you could

84
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,509
be violating wiretap laws so be sure to
know those laws

85
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:43,780
innovate am second know the scanner loss
for the state in which you operate in

86
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,139
some states in all I'd have scanners in
your

87
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,729
cars in vehicles are you need to know
that before you enter into that state

88
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:55,360
us you're not breaking the law when you
get there second

89
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,330
make sure any activities that you are
going to be performing are authorizing

90
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,359
the rules of engagement you have set up
with the client

91
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,350
if your gonna be monitoring things like
wireless headsets cameras are things

92
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,310
make sure to the endoscope and
engagement

93
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,970
and you're legally allowed to be
performing at in finally

94
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,710
in most states it is legal to monitor
any radio transmission as long as it's

95
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,750
not telephone or pager traffic

96
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,680
so from a legal point of view there's a
huge range out there as long as it's not

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,820
again telephone or pager traffic

98
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,080
couple more Realty to avoid I

99
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,770
first I'm still not a lawyer a second
term

100
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,049
have some activities are to be avoided
jamming have any sort

101
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,020
is illegal even if a client says you're
able to dream transmissions on our

102
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,650
property to test how resistant

103
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,360
our network is to now it do cell phone
jammers to this to that

104
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,289
even if it's on their property they
don't actually own the spectrum the

105
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,500
spectrum is owned by the US government
so unless the US government is giving

106
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,110
you permission to do it you can actually
GM inside United States

107
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,780
so unless you actually working for the
government you're not have permission

108
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,729
actually GM transmissions

109
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:01,409
second decoding Peter traffic is also a
legal

110
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,030
on sadly scenario can will be dubbed
into too much considering our new

111
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,669
look at most companies with my sense
information is transmitted through

112
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,840
pagers

113
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,970
I am that could be easily coated with
freely available software

114
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,180
but in terms of the legal activities
that something is not legally allowed

115
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,539
secondly be careful about actually
transmitting

116
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,639
unless you are license a transpacific
frequency again be legal transmit

117
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,240
frequency

118
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,960
so if you're monitoring our
transmissions wanna throw momma trans me

119
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,370
something back to them tend to be a
guard

120
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,199
most likely you and I would be an
illegal transmission unless you want to

121
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,930
do

122
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,030
another Paso the legal warnings get into
kind if the steps I take

123
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,440
when performing up physical plant
astrological penthouse

124
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,319
to start points and radio traffic for
saying like any penetration testing on a

125
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,580
profile the target

126
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,240
profile target figure out information
about it %uh start to gather up some

127
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,500
faxing and help you in future attacks

128
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,889
before going on site I like to do some
basic of so profiling

129
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,229
basically determines much information as
I can about the site

130
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,740
and if already a travs in scope about
the radio systems they use

131
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,169
couple examples of things you might
wanna be looking for are the using

132
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,710
in-house or contract guard force

133
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,069
if they're using a contract guard for
CNN look up for that guard force for

134
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,479
frequencies a year cities and in-house
guard force again you can look up

135
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,840
for this is a redshirt a corporation a
nice been information no could also

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,949
change your plan to attack depending on
if

137
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,180
a its in-house or outsource guard force
a could also

138
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,860
adjust how you want to approach the
organization and during a physical

139
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,740
penetration test

140
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,490
next you can look at what frequencies
the corporations license to use

141
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,979
next page alaska's how to find those and
then also see if you can find the make

142
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,330
and model commit they're using

143
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,400
of through news releases and stuffing
and sometimes find information on

144
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,560
so the easiest way to find safer nation
out his ass you're calling go to Google

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,490
of

146
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,500
some ideas are things you might want to
do all things like company name and then

147
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:58,979
just

148
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,180
scanner frequency guard frequency
megahertz

149
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,180
their times over radio enthusiast web
sites out there which have already

150
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,889
categorized

151
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,840
large portions of the spectrum and have
already set up you know here's for

152
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,669
company a

153
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,889
years our guards here's the taxi service
here's this year's that

154
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,270
so a lot of hobbies web sites out there
that already have allies information he

155
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,750
figured out for you

156
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,870
use Google to find information next look
for things like press releases from

157
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,160
radio manufacturers resellers other as a
guard in the target

158
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,080
if a large manufacturing of Motorola
sells a large radio system the company

159
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,039
access to one in radio system

160
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,519
they could put out a press release
saying hey we just saw this

161
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,349
multi-million dollar radio system to
this company that has all these features

162
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,500
does this does that is this

163
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,240
great information on profound a tired XD
now know what features are a system has

164
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,360
often what's been a board what they
could make in support all sorts a good

165
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,750
stuff

166
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,709
additionally look for simillar press
releases from guard outsourcing

167
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:53,830
companies

168
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,740
if a car company gets a contract with
large employer still often if they can

169
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,089
brag about your press releases so again

170
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,860
good way to figure out who's actually
doing the guard services for the company

171
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,860
again digital information other good
places to look online

172
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,080
I wanna my favorite sites is ready
reference acecomm

173
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,480
they have a free section which has a
huge database frequencies out there

174
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,310
basically populated by

175
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,290
our radio enthusiast so you can book
open area for the free which is used for

176
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,260
that area

177
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,529
dig through it possible find your target
in there

178
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:29,189
with the frequencies listed if I don't
find information there

179
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,100
if they are you saying I'm FCC license
frequency as well

180
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,680
he should be license at the FCC but
sometimes a lecture tour reseller so the

181
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,320
company name may not be posted
immediately company that they bought the

182
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,060
US through

183
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,990
earlier we see him through but if it is
under the company name

184
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,870
you can search the FCC database directly
the SEC Davis itself can be downloaded

185
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,480
online search through

186
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,790
but generally easier to just pay to use
a third-party service

187
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,449
on national radio did has won a bomb for
comes another one to come please check

188
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:58,910
out

189
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,160
for that service yeah

190
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,180
the FCC website as I recall you action
you to download a database directly you

191
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,700
can actually

192
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,990
I am search it through the FCC website
but you can download the database files

193
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,100
and then

194
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,610
you to set up to par cette database file
so depending on

195
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,100
an active in her things and also the FCC
database seems to fluctuate between

196
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,250
being available for free online or being
on some broken for the SEC website so

197
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,250
you can actually download

198
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,510
from if you have the time resources
download it parcero

199
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,480
if not could be hazardous to pay 230
bucks here

200
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,740
%uh the other addresses thing if you do
down with a database directly

201
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,600
um they do have latitude and longitude
42 license location for the transmitters

202
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,980
so that can be very handy as well and
that's actually one sir is set up for

203
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,860
calm

204
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,060
offers you type in alleged longitude
show all transmitters were then

205
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,810
100 miles 10 miles what not I would use
that service a lot we're doing bug

206
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,640
sweeping

207
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,079
because we need to know to legitimate
frequencies in that area so we were busy

208
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
run a report from them say okay to
staying at this hotel

209
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,290
show me all transmitters with an axe
number miles so that we know

210
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,730
have a list a possible from the
frequencies in the area we going to this

211
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,730
in 2d or sweep yeah

212
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,590
me a question is a

213
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,180
person or somebody who works at a site
that claims two blocks often

214
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,580
transmissions from leaving aside

215
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,580
um

216
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,870
possible that they would have the
ability to jam transmissions most likely

217
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,640
what they're doing is arm

218
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,290
most companies now either she or whole
buildings so that to be issues have a

219
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,400
fair day case a transmissions can tag
and her axe at

220
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,260
um and also if there's a sorta phosphide
work is being worked on these you don't

221
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,060
cite a skiff

222
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,500
which is basically a sealed vault where
he took a transmitter inside their can

223
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,330
transmit out

224
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,830
I have a lot of places also to check
yourself in at the door so the usual

225
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,270
kinda varying where's the fence most
ones I've seen though aren't actually

226
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,120
using jamming

227
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,580
they're just yelling the whole building
the other plus there is

228
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,170
if anyone brings in any sort a
transmitter a jam resign or cassette

229
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,770
range

230
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,040
where some reason any sort a transmitter
is gonna help

231
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,310
dead in that signal unblock it so it
could prevent other two transmissions as

232
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,600
well

233
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,940
here just a quick example

234
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,560
I you know literally a couple seconds on
Google did a search for

235
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,690
you know double friends to see our quota

236
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,430
hotel Pennsylvania and quote a frequency
and

237
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,930
followed up this hobby a site that lists
all these frequencies in New York City

238
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,010
I am hotels are very popular casino is a
very popular but even

239
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,250
businesses in the area if they have
radios you know they're guys at this is

240
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,590
they spend all day listening to radio
counter rising everything great resource

241
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,270
to use

242
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,939
next

243
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,990
when I arrived on site there couple
steps I take to

244
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,440
to profile the target first thing I like
to use something called a frequency

245
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,880
counter

246
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,420
this an example the one up here

247
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,290
poses a great little device pretty small
you can change on a couple different and

248
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:37,870
it types

249
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,540
and what this does is basically fines
near-field signals

250
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,030
so if it's a strong signal that's
basically general site

251
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,620
if it's a mobile transmitter or a tower
with inside

252
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,450
if it's a walk around like an
walkie-talkie it's going to be

253
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,850
20 to 50 feet anything it transmits near
this

254
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,040
its gonna record the frequency and this
and

255
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,290
then you can use that too busy for print
the area

256
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,390
the one thing I like about the Scout
most frequency

257
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,949
counters only can record one frequency
at a time

258
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,270
the Scout connect record I believe it's
five hundred frequencies and they can

259
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,839
tell

260
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,580
if you treatment he's been hit up to
turn fifty six times so it's very easy

261
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,339
to

262
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,980
run this through an area and basically
take it back and see okay we have one

263
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,850
frequency those hit 100 times

264
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,510
probably something of interest on that
frequency a

265
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,510
the analog Scout which is what you want
from most use

266
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,410
and believe is three to four dollars are
you can find a muse 2050 find and use I

267
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,319
guarantee the battery pack will be dead

268
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,420
that's the most people sell 'em anyone
has any electric strings can pop it open

269
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,360
go down to Radio Shack you love about
restored another just four

270
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,870
AAA battery AA batteries poppin good as
new the other quick thing to note with

271
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,650
these if you do get them online the
front and amplifier

272
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,400
is very sensitive and can often get
blown out so that there's definitely a a

273
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,060
roulette game if you get it online

274
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,209
effect amplifiers blown out the cost to
fix the muscle by new radio

275
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:08,400
question back a trucking

276
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,600
I'll be discussing a little bit later
for I there is a digital version at a

277
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,070
scout

278
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,870
which can log on to you digital signal
so for something like

279
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,220
after 25 another digital format
generally though that I found to be less

280
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,150
useful occurs for the most part of
someone's using a digital radio system

281
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,270
unless you have very high and you're not
be mailed to decoder

282
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,620
now the question is what about tracking
systems I

283
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,990
so for the most part reckoning on the
analog Scout both talk about some other

284
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,240
tracking stuff later on

285
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,540
a coupla problems with us it can be
difficult to use an urban rich area

286
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,550
for instance inside New York City

287
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,980
this divisiveness be worthless because
it's gonna lock onto the strongest

288
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,580
signal

289
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,310
and sensor Sony TV transmitters in the
air and other things miss a good strong

290
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,270
signals going to be the local TV station

291
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,620
not the guard radio I am so to some keep
in mind but a

292
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,730
a handy little tool are

293
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:09,730
yeah the ambassador

294
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,089
yeah basically to repeat a

295
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,310
the power supply in this if you order it
from e-bay

296
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,940
may not come into power supply if you
purchase one make sure to play it is

297
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,460
cracked

298
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,050
cuz ur they don't even you know they
didn't spend the two cents but sometimes

299
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,399
and it has to protect you from
collecting your own player day

300
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,240
City connector on player you gonna blow
the power supply and India repaired

301
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,240
K under some stuff to do for our on-site
rekon

302
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,170
when you get there trying to visual
identity

303
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,179
I a number items a look for to make a
model the radio

304
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,670
know the length and type antenna if you
have

305
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,809
something that's a very short antenna
verse is a very long antenna that's

306
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:18,530
going to tell you

307
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,980
something about the frequency range is
being used generally the longer the

308
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,720
antenna

309
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,439
the lower the frequency range on this is
where going into some ham radio

310
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,559
certainly helpful to start understand
the physics

311
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,770
involves from also be sure to note if
they're using the same make and model

312
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,280
love radio if there's a mix if there's a
mix of radio's most likely to not use

313
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,440
any special features like drinking on
trips and could turn this feature is not

314
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,290
work well

315
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,970
across a radio models so if you're
seeing a site where there forever radio

316
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,160
tapes most likely you're not using
anything super special because in ED all

317
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,440
these radios work together

318
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,929
and generally radius a different makes
and models can

319
00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:00,740
sometimes not play well together on the
same system use information gathered

320
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,770
determine things like frequency range

321
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,559
what freaks features are you stomp base
of the make and model of

322
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,000
are you gonna figure out if the Sportage
dole trunking

323
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,730
trypsin those type of things something
very helpful here

324
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,860
is to get a camera to take a picture and
do some online searching for

325
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,630
manufacture are rated X like myself to
do so while I can look at a radio

326
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,470
know to make and model tell you other
sorts of things about it just because

327
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,900
that's what I obsess about it on

328
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,660
are for other folks in a good pitchers
are looking online

329
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,670
up that maps are calm is a phenomenal
site for anything related to

330
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,330
Motorola radios next one is

331
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,449
a again on tape refine this is very
research resource-intensive

332
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,390
but basically start searching common
frequency ranges know certain common

333
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,880
triggers your interest people use our F
arrest GRS dot frequencies and then some

334
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,280
rain just listed below that

335
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,389
business and other things tend to fall
into searches range is looking for

336
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,130
activity

337
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,809
against very resource-intensive because
you need to hear someone when they're

338
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:02,760
transmitting

339
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,790
can take a long time to find the
frequency but if it's the only option

340
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,550
possible

341
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,928
as I can go they're also set ranges for

342
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:14,790
cordless phones headsets battery thing
again just make sure it's in scope in

343
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,270
your

344
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:21,780
legally monitoring a seen a breeze for
some too hard or recommendations

345
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,490
phiri has questions about why
recommended scanners prefer to come up

346
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,290
afterwards

347
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,559
basically just the general
recommendation of three-level the

348
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,490
scanners to get

349
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,120
I the top and one if you're not doing a
truck transmissions which

350
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,840
generally for corporate I am profiling I
find it's not really a

351
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,970
trucks internally or not used if you
doing with local municipalities are

352
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,700
governments

353
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,050
drunken come into play you're not
interest in Montreat front radios are

354
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,770
working in the area 8200

355
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,450
are mainly because as a wide frequency
range sound made radio

356
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,020
in is very easy to control from a
computer I am

357
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,320
written a number programs to control
8200 see a fun things like

358
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,668
drive around map about frequencies with

359
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,929
GPS servicing an award I'll around the
area figure out the frequency footprint

360
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,080
very easy to do

361
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,210
someone who is not a programmer
interface at this thing next one down

362
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,540
if you're looking at trucks systems the
Uniden Bearkat

363
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,178
%ah BCD 3960

364
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,290
or the latest GRE radio in this range is
comparable

365
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,870
for your recommendation again great
radio haven't tried computer controlling

366
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,410
it could be as easy to use

367
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:38,860
in an even a cheap radio the near Bear
Cat they're raising serious 180 bucks

368
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,860
a kiss to receive a wide range of things
not gonna have some other

369
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,240
more advanced features they can be ready
it started

370
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
the other thing to look at is follow a
radio shack on another new radio they

371
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,970
greatly discount the old ones pawn shop
so the great places

372
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,600
are you don't need a super sophisticated
radio to start listen to other stuff

373
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,600
so even a cheap one get off a be there
are other places can get the job done

374
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:09,270
if you haven't had unlimited budget icon
make some pretty amazing radios

375
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,300
the one listed here wide frequency range

376
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,390
also to bells and whistles can decode
video has built-in decoders but you know

377
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,830
cost fourteen grant

378
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,350
and is also like three or four you so
it's it's a huge radio

379
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,390
but you know if you have the budget
months ago all up

380
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,050
in 60s six years

381
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,408
oca yeah it's they're they're not small

382
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,840
it's far from portable you not to miss
lott on your belt care on the site

383
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,840
of there's a question back

384
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,158
um I would say that they are his ass in
original a slider they scanners

385
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,230
or the radios I would say that they are

386
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,050
depend on your definition regular
scanner and see all the more scanners

387
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,240
cuz all them have frequencies in program
and/or then scan

388
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,159
are all mr. Skinner's because they all
have fun channel banks you can program

389
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,179
up to then scan through

390
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,100
the Uniden ones are definitely more
consumer

391
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,350
grade hobbyist scanners for AR tends to
make stuff is more for the serious

392
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,760
hobbyist for professional line

393
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,760
has been a difference as Answer Question

394
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,290
oh yeah they they yeah they they do not
transmit

395
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,639
I formed when I actually like to use is
this little use you

396
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,820
a the VXX I believe the x5

397
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,200
um and that is my camera as well but can
receive a wide range

398
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,990
if anyone is a ham radio operator the
priority know more about radio slattery

399
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,300
in their own side and recover
transmitting

400
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,310
and also get a legal issues well I D
this is a very I use discuss why have

401
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,000
with me at most times

402
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
yeah

403
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,950
your YouTube a silly question was the
runny privacy issues you definitely can

404
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,120
and that's where we're looking at the
rules of engagement everyone in your

405
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,470
legal staff review them

406
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,820
to make sure that you are breaking any
privacy laws

407
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,149
addition is again into some two case
studies later on we need actually get

408
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,050
involved the company's legal staff to
make sure their proper language inside

409
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:27,680
their employees

410
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,260
handbook sees me to allow us to monitor
these type of things

411
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,420
so you definitely can run to privacy
problems and a

412
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,800
very good to have filed legal staff
involved to review it to make sure that

413
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,130
your

414
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:46,130
your remaining above board other
question to

415
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,860
yes

416
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,780
oh yeah at the icon would not be the

417
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,310
the the best for that I it does have a
spectroscope function

418
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,929
on what your talkin basis said would it
be cheaper to a spectrum analyzer

419
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,980
after the values that and that can being
when I was doing a

420
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,510
Tsem work busy all that work was done
with a spectrum analyzer

421
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,570
a lot of those are up to like fifty
thousand dollars spectrum analyzers

422
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,280
I the biggest spectrum analyzer that
they are

423
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,670
they can be very expensive they are
heavy at times

424
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,530
and also they tend to have a shorter
range then a dedicated

425
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:42,050
a receiver generally fine transmission
spectrum analyzer wanna my interview

426
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,419
with and flip over to

427
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,500
a your scanner radio some sort at
reminder that transmission

428
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,450
but it can be a great way to quickly see
the spectrum FinePix

429
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,000
zoom in on it generally though that be
outside arrange a most mobile

430
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,990
penetration testers

431
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,430
I'll

432
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,840
okay you so much service monitors arm
for analyzing cell phone traffic the

433
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,889
biggest issue there's mind resolve in
traffic

434
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,560
oca yeah

435
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,810
in Adobe one area definitely look at

436
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,970
I some other scanners have similar
features all basis can try and find

437
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,310
activities as well

438
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,159
there's a ton a radio stuff out there in
terms of year that you could pull in

439
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:34,160
the future I saw the question was a
nurse uniform in spectrum analyzer

440
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,250
I saw um seem very serrations

441
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,580
a where you can take like a source cover
we was want to get the trace

442
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,030
with some other things OCR

443
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:51,840
yet to see it

444
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,250
ok

445
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,420
I'll definitely check out his arm when
his unit ESEM stuff allies have had to

446
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,120
be

447
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,480
very sensitive but for obvious stuff
free stock alerts

448
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,770
great I'm gonna keep moving on so we
have time for

449
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,180
arrested cuz I got some case studies
attended a more interesting about how to

450
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,220
actually use this

451
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,400
quick overview

452
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,800
I am recommend other accessories a good
antenna bass remix torsten he re missing

453
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,420
as a No

454
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,620
if you had to look at investing in a
good ready or a good antenna

455
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,700
investigate intense bachelors gonna porn
the sing-off

456
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,160
me a couple recommendations up there I

457
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,860
you know rubber ducky flux what s me
great did attend a short-range

458
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,880
with need to hide something on yourself
great way to hide it I am

459
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,230
other things recommend looking at
frequency counter charity mentioned

460
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,170
a recording equipment can be helpful
especially a trick or the transmissions

461
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,970
that you're hearing

462
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,590
cuz be able to playback audio I offer
had a security other guards I'm not

463
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,680
something they shouldn't be

464
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,090
is often far more effective than trying
to relate what they're saying

465
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,280
again make sure it's in the rules of
engagement be careful what you're

466
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,920
recording

467
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,720
cameras as well as a mention for visual
profiling can be very helpful to get

468
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,380
better. the radio then take it back and
figure out what it is

469
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,990
us here not trying to remember the
details overt duty of decoders

470
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,480
also of organ and case studies and
family video converters which can take

471
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,860
signals from a radio and converted into
video discuss it again in case studies

472
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,590
so it's going to some real-world
examples

473
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:31,150
for word use this technique and what's
gotten us for scenario

474
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,740
a physical penetration test on a casino
during are so profound that a site

475
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,410
discovered

476
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,420
the frequency on the radio link between
casino security in the state police

477
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,650
sources person in a skinner

478
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,770
susie is form this is very helpful

479
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,930
r1 we wanted to be able to monitor that
frequency because

480
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,890
if this casino security call the state
police we definitely want to know about

481
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,320
it

482
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,870
cuz casino security showing up in
busting us if we take out a card that

483
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,420
says yes this was to be here

484
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,480
they'll probably say okay that's fine
you know and a task it off site

485
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,380
if the police get involved they may
decide to say well

486
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,790
yeah but we now have 12 cop cars here so
we're gonna take you down to have some

487
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,780
more questions answered

488
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,210
so generally you know when the police
start to get involved good time to

489
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,570
stop the test so good thing to monitor
just to see if the test goes outside of

490
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:18,980
the

491
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,080
casino itself gunsight

492
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,129
when we arrived at night sort in mind
during the link found a couple

493
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,220
interesting things

494
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,670
arm the dispatchers were very chatty
with the police

495
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,590
a specially after-hours when not much is
going on in this small town

496
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,870
I and not much is going on the casino a

497
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,630
they spent a lot of time just talking
back and forth shooting the breeze

498
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,870
through so through this we learned a
couple interesting things including the

499
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,190
second and third shift

500
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,610
dispatchers name which became very handy
later on

501
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,430
next should have on-site the next day
this official identification and saw the

502
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,130
radios are carrying around

503
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,170
looked like Motorola HD Pro Series most
likely to GP

504
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:07,050
33.8% a went to bat labs look at that
radio found out the frequency range that

505
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,389
operates in

506
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,660
then looked at the antennas that were
used on the radio so they're shorter

507
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,400
antennas tend to suggest they are used
in just

508
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,010
the to higher frequency ranges also
notice on on a

509
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,390
to support site these radios do not
support encryption or trunking

510
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:27,210
so if we can find the frequencies we can
easily monitor it

511
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,140
next with a p/e casino where we can
actually get access to building

512
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,680
we did a walk through the casino women a

513
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,660
had a little drink moved around with a
scout

514
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,750
service you this little guy um OneNote
anything really to radio inside the

515
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,670
casino make sure it's well hidden

516
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,890
if casino security guards carry see you
carrying on a radio anything it looks

517
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,370
like a radio or anything that they don't
understand it has plenty lights

518
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,660
are you could find yourself slammed up
against a wall and you know have all

519
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,780
sorts of fun happy things happen to you

520
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,120
I'll one not on engagement I've gotten
very odd questions

521
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,010
and you know a little bit manhandling 37
radios inside casinos

522
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,190
the guards are getting very very freaked
out when they don't understand things

523
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:13,430
so just make sure if you are operating
environment keep your wallet and

524
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:18,720
slid a little walk around came out to
carpool the frequencies from the Scout

525
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,740
noted a once in a range is to you
supported found about a dozen

526
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,080
frequencies

527
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,340
program those into the radio and then I

528
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,500
into a scanner started listening and
found the guards

529
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:37,500
to this question that

530
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,540
their in essence no there are ways to
detect receivers

531
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,670
arm but unless you're talking about some
very high and radio gear and stuff it's

532
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,430
more academic than use for

533
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,180
I'm not really and F lee nothing no
casino in a

534
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,960
a question was is there any way to
detect that you have a scanner on you

535
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,080
I am years our way besides just seeing
it

536
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,129
the others Ian run into depending on
where you're at in efficacy no in

537
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,890
downtown Detroit you're gonna have to go
through metal detectors

538
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,040
a you know so taking other stuff of your
body and stuff is going to be

539
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:18,030
visible fearing a senior can easily walk
in you're not really gonna notice

540
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,340
servicer to Monterey be guard
frequencies hurt again

541
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,850
general chatter guards going on an
off-duty learned a couple a valuable

542
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,000
things from this

543
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,870
first we learn the lingo at the at the
client side

544
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,440
in this is very handy for when now we
decide to go in as a physical contest

545
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,630
once again side to go Navy insert using
the lingo this you need to be there

546
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,450
so while also getting to the data center
news place data center is called the

547
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,150
dungeon

548
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,250
so we got an international hey i'm
looking for the dungeon

549
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,320
they just assume you know you're talking
about they all say oh yeah it's right

550
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,550
through their

551
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:01,050
so again in the lingo can be very very
helpful NexStar to learn guards names

552
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,129
I am this is awful is only run into
people use it 0

553
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,510
I ran into Sammy Sammy say should come
over here years ago

554
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,910
0 I guess was to be here is so my new
sent you over

555
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,580
so again very helpful to build up trust
and vote of confidence he should be

556
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,220
allowed into the area

557
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,760
we also learned shift changes occurred
which can often provide outbreaks in

558
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,650
coverage

559
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,190
and finally learned to schedule rotation
at Gartner doing the rounds

560
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,500
so there's usually you know premier
Garcia surrounding cars doing rounds

561
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,410
if you know big are doing rounds is now
on your side a building

562
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,960
that's very handy in this case we
actually got a free t

563
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,770
I we were sitting there listening to the
frequencies and in the back parking lot

564
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,350
I am bentsen parking of an employee's
there's a back gate races no cardiac

565
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,320
card access there's the car say they
have to flash a badge to

566
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,740
as you're listening to it the guard
basically really had to use the bathroom

567
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,890
that day

568
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,850
so we kept on hearing um your rear guard
shack

569
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,850
I need to use the bathroom requesting on
break

570
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,990
ok Ill get someone back there you know
by mister

571
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,940
rear guard shack I really had to use the
bathroom can you please get someone back

572
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,590
here

573
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,110
find out about a half an hour this nikka
know that their fire dispatcher goes

574
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,530
okay

575
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:19,040
I can going back there just make a quick
and get back shippers fast

576
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,060
so with so much to guard we've go inside
in just 48 and park

577
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,679
and that's what we're inside the
employee lot already people start to

578
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,470
trust us because paper in the employee
lot

579
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,720
get out the car walk in go the employee
entrance go up

580
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,350
drop the name a dispatcher from last
night here here last a worker's salary

581
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,540
to get some other parts

582
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,200
she decide to come back and let you need
officials up in a dungeon irony sally oh

583
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,760
yeah she's a great person

584
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,140
get thrown all these details we learned
from talking to guard you know I ash

585
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,280
stomach is this and that

586
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,120
great gives visitors here bashas me
check your ID is let us right in

587
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,820
go inside and once you're inside use
other things our names are things today

588
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,050
randa Sammy city you coulda you know if
a student here to get to this thing but

589
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,960
I'm not sure where it is I'll let me
take you to a so all these little things

590
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,180
you can build up

591
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,690
to then when you enter into the company
having believe that you're supposed to

592
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,909
be there you know stuff basically you
some a social engineering skills to gain

593
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:15,389
people's trust

594
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:22,389
yeah

595
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:33,230
%um

596
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,600
generally the way the we handle them in
their

597
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,690
you can put in size up to hide its the
bigger thing is

598
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,550
this antenna verses you know this
antenna this in turn to receive a lot

599
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,550
more than a short one

600
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,920
down so the big thing is

601
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,359
what will usually do is have a team
outside that has radio dear

602
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:12,020
can have antennas on top of the card
other than I'll

603
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,759
with much better in tennis get a better
range listen to stuff and then a related

604
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,340
interest people inside whether that be
to your pieces are just cell phones

605
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,380
you know today can have someone walk
around a building a cell phone up to a

606
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:22,869
year

607
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,320
no one thinks anything other than in
fact if someone's care not to soften up

608
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,490
to hear their prime more likely be left
alone

609
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,780
you know people in all doors open for
you if you look busy never softened

610
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,590
are so usually have you know the stuff
be intercepted

611
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,460
right outside then relayed into the team
inside but also just the last team

612
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,410
inside to

613
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,560
focus on what they should be doing
oppose to need to monitor all sorts of

614
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,279
stuff in

615
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,020
just you know limit us up they need to
do is they can focus on the job

616
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,540
case study number two

617
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,810
this was a internal penetration test at
a

618
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,109
I guess insurance provider %uh this is
more of a

619
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:06,000
it. logical penetration test a while
being escorted through the building

620
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
we know some wide number of wireless
headsets and use awesome because this

621
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,720
week wasn't add this to scope

622
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,090
are the engagement and basically then
now

623
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,300
work to their lawyers were two are
lawyers to you come up with rules

624
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,800
engagement to Thomas go

625
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,640
in this case we actually had to make
sure that

626
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,890
various laws were complied with in terms
of could we actually mantra these

627
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,790
transmissions

628
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,350
looked at the employee handbook and
found the employer did have the ability

629
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,368
to monitor any

630
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:35,800
phone calls are taking place inside the
facility they can extend that write to

631
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,369
us

632
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:39,950
ball book from so got their permission

633
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,810
started scanning through headsets found
several dozen headsets

634
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,869
in the night her freak makers frequency
range the next thing was

635
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:51,410
we need to the new signal strength
energy graphic information to figure out

636
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,560
which had such were inside the target
building

637
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,279
because obviously we didn't want to
start monitoring phone calls from

638
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,500
someone outside the area

639
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,810
us it isn't regulation other tricks to
figure out which ones were inside a

640
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,880
building came up with there was two
targets

641
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,350
start monitoring him well we heard um

642
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,330
lots of phone calls I allow their help
desk

643
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,430
had the phone calls in fact the Password
Reset

644
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:20,390
sectional help desk was using these
headsets which was national when

645
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,618
a found employs checking their voicemail
on this is where

646
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:28,030
when their type in their password yet a
DTMF decoder it could then decode those

647
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,920
tones to tell you the numbers

648
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,859
very helpful for them being able to
check your voicemail for them

649
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:37,980
I am the other neat thing is the

650
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,690
the radio ads up there there rebrand by
a variety different ones by the

651
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,920
the older analog ones even when they're
the phone is of the hawk

652
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,570
if the headset is on there still
transmitting so they're basically in a

653
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,700
storeroom bug

654
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,260
that is on as long as you're in the
office us that can be just

655
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,790
really super helpful is also generally
these headsets are given to

656
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,970
are people over could help desks
executives are executive assistants

657
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,430
so basically you know all the important
people that we want to learn what

658
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,240
they're talking about

659
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,400
so it's just a great way to learn
information

660
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,730
I know when I was doing the corporate
side for Tsem

661
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,980
has her huge concern with executives cuz
you could learn a lot about

662
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,710
your love the work I did there I knew
about things like mergers and

663
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,619
acquisitions before most people did
because you could hear the executives

664
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:25,780
talk about on the phone

665
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,920
and put together nuclear these things
are you

666
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,640
airs wanna watch for sensor
conversations especially if your son is

667
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,940
transmitting all the time

668
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,060
so what do we learn as I mentioned

669
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,130
a use my pass reset section to help desk
which was super helpful because we could

670
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,950
then listen to them someone call up

671
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,510
it is a Sally after I password okay
what's your social security number

672
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,330
great what's you know where do you work

673
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,380
you know all sorts of information is
very awful about it so one we could

674
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,320
reset their password if you today for
you too

675
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,770
but also they were then say okay your
new password is blah blah blah

676
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,150
you need to change once you login at
that point a basic as a basic a race

677
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,619
condition if we can login before she can

678
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:09,170
we think it a valid token can use the
system you're on Windows to talk and

679
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,070
he's a good for like four to six hours

680
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,670
login may not be a privileged account
restored access to make certain you many

681
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,470
things

682
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,640
in if the password you know you need to
change it does change it person on the

683
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,250
phone dirty I tried that password
doesn't work

684
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,430
I'll let me changed again didn't even
think about it because you know Suffolk

685
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,580
that you normally doesn't work but I T

686
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,299
additionally we found that these
headsets we exceed overall expansion on

687
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,630
it

688
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,150
and found that we can actually mantra
these headsets for up to three blocks

689
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,950
away

690
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,940
are using pretty simple equipment I am
so we them for the same to the external

691
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,380
penetration test where they're running
Citrix nurse up the outside without two

692
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,920
factor authentication

693
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,130
so you can watch people call up remember
login to Citrix box

694
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,430
get access control network and you know
this event into the company

695
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,819
because this Acer Tiffany two-factor
authentication to actually be able to

696
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,800
you're preventing NC State attacks also
learned about

697
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,250
voicemail password a lot of information
again very helpful stuff

698
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:10,930
arm you know lots of much as in some
information

699
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,290
second case study was a physical
penetration test at a power plant

700
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,940
only gone on-site started a profinder
site

701
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,390
we noticed along the back for a
memorable odd it was a

702
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,690
basically a front was where the power
plant was in there is a huge stores

703
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,730
linebacker they had

704
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,180
probably acres love very sick with men
from

705
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,859
polls to transformers other things back
in a backlight

706
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,410
along the back for a min early noticed
that the cameras that were in place

707
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,868
all had antennas on the same poll so
instantly hours

708
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:45,950
curious about this I'll looks like the
antennas for tuna but not her megahertz

709
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,680
by the size of them

710
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,649
superseded and scan through common
frequencies used by wireless cameras

711
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,560
a if you do searches online to find ways
to these frequencies

712
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,580
use the device listed here which is %uh

713
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,020
in a row device which may see a plug
into a high and Skinner

714
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,680
but has what's called a knife output
poisonous device building convert that

715
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,160
to UAE armpit search and display in a TV

716
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,279
so then scan through found a ride the
video signals

717
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,570
and started looking at security camera
feeds no one notes

718
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,220
I i found that the Aero device is one
the best ones in the area

719
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,320
the only problem is it only does NTSC
doesn't do Pau

720
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,339
so if you're operating in europe I am
more powers to be a format

721
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:33,080
probably be a good choice over there but
in states works well

722
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,369
icon makes a radio call the Arts three
which has a built in the Austrian a

723
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,630
decoder for you

724
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,290
and generally found that kinda be a
piece a crap for this to work as a very

725
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,670
short range

726
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,869
so it's well worth to get a high and
radio points from device to get a larger

727
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,859
set up but works very very well

728
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,869
so plug it in certain Washington be a
feed a

729
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:57,100
learned another interesting things about
the target could see things like you

730
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,900
know where they're holding the camera
coverage that helped us plan is a need

731
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,339
to cross this large lot

732
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:04,859
was the best with the planet we could
see where the

733
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,119
PTC pan tilt zoom cameras were looking

734
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,640
again you to figure out where they just
on a normal sweet reaction control by

735
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,359
people

736
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,410
for being controlled by per census more
rhetoric which price I'm looking at it

737
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,089
if it's just a normal sweep most the
time see if the guards looking at a wall

738
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:21,130
a video cameras

739
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,619
my civil smart video system in place
actually looks for anomalies

740
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:29,900
after five to 10 minutes even the best
friend are just gonna zone out

741
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,440
said he just uses the general sweet
going on most likely don't even watching

742
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,030
it

743
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,450
I am so again very easy to bridge that
could also see a person or moving inside

744
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,440
the property

745
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,790
so again you could avoid them as you're
moving up to the building

746
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,550
so lot survival information to be
learned in this case we actually found

747
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,690
that

748
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,420
the cameras were set up so that I we
actually decided to do the attempt to

749
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,600
penetration during the day because the
way the cameras were set up

750
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,600
when the Sun would rise the cameras 1
Sep correctly

751
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,700
are actually wash out the video so
basically they were blinded during the

752
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,310
Sun

753
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:07,690
when the Sun is rising I lost all video
coverage could easily cut across

754
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,910
and again once again to this property is
you have a hard hat on you have on the

755
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:16,250
fireproof suits all the other stuff that
my man having a purchase online

756
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,920
most likely people are gonna really
bother you and if they do

757
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,339
are you know lottery how fortress-like
man I'm just a contractor aside here to

758
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,020
get this

759
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,750
and the like and it's like inside the
building I'll really can you show me

760
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:32,550
I'll yes so what's your own side again
gained into trust to be operator

761
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,350
cover

762
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,430
so couple interesting things are coming
on the horizon

763
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,520
wonderboy been able to radio dispatch
systems

764
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,859
these have been really fun on have been
able to find an employer them

765
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:53,009
basically a lot avoid adjust your radio
system said you dispatcher Bernard avoid

766
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,950
on the plus services are you gonna get
some flexibility where the dispatch

767
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,290
centers located

768
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:02,240
example this urs University has working
with those super excited and so this new

769
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,720
radio system

770
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,000
like our dispatcher can take your laptop
plugin anywhere on the network concert

771
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,350
dispatching calls

772
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,960
it's great if someone takes over are a
police station there's a fire there's

773
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,660
whatever deuces grab your laptop in five
minutes

774
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:21,379
find a network Jack go over the wireless
plug in Converse are dispatching calls

775
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,690
which to them is a great thing to me is
kinda scary much fun

776
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,900
from you necessary looking at that found
out you know they're not encrypt and

777
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,450
avoid if they're very very propagation

778
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,930
you can also access to dispatch system
from the Student Network all sorts of

779
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,000
other fun stuff

780
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,470
arm similar with businesses are seeing
this as well

781
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,200
a lot a large businesses are going to
voice systems so if I am

782
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,819
know there's a court system we're doing
work with where the main radio room

783
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:50,350
if that was taken over they could take
their laptops plugging in Europe and

784
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,109
buildings are dispatching calls

785
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:55,470
again a really cool feature but it is
not set up correctly

786
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:59,520
can cause a lot of problems are other
areas are seeing

787
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,460
ducked interception on two years ago I
don't believe

788
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,770
CCC their sums research released under
something ducked communications

789
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,940
decked is a digital format used by a lot
of phones in Europe

790
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,970
close friends in europe and it's
becoming more popular United States

791
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:20,069
Sudan what used to be considered secure
transmission steered it a cryptid

792
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:23,190
can now be intercepted with fairly cheap
equipment

793
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,069
and the other interesting is coming a
serious offer defined radios such as a

794
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:30,730
US RP these are basically radios that

795
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,700
miss any in to rebuild the hardware to
do some different mondragon actually

796
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,170
just to go through code

797
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,410
to certain a CO detector interception
can take place three SRP

798
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:44,160
I am Chris pagination really interesting
stuff with intercepting just some

799
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,120
traffic

800
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,370
and it's really opening up a whole new
are a very aware before you need to get

801
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:50,850
some very expensive per year

802
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,109
now just the US are Piazza grant you can
do a lot of really neat stuff

803
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:59,270
if you're the permeability

804
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,270
so with all this what are some defenses
that can be used

805
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,300
first of all tests our commitment make
sure headsets and cordless phones are

806
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,530
secure

807
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:12,650
make sure that you know they have our
global security for what your

808
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,330
a thread Egyptian be you to perform a
risk assessment are sent to be attacking

809
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:21,420
your systems you know if your company
that makes toilet paper for giraffes

810
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,069
you probably don't need to worry about
someone spending millions of dollars to

811
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:28,359
Montreal radio systems are probably use
who is getting

812
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:31,980
if you´re governments to classified
work to other stuff like that your

813
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,120
thread agents are going to be very very
different city governor sending that to

814
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,618
make sure your equipment is secured to
that standard

815
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:42,230
next check your facility for onyx to
radio traffic

816
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,290
pretty interesting stuff they'll come
out a

817
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,350
another strain see occasionally find out
there are

818
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,950
arm occasion devices that are used by

819
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,330
arm people are hard of hearing which
will actually

820
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,830
amplify audio a which can again transmit
conversations

821
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,890
you know those things will be in areas
you after pickup strange conversations

822
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:03,720
there

823
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,180
a lot of presentations rooms your
executives do their big executive

824
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,460
presentations use wireless microphones

825
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,600
so those are having their super secret
board meeting their busy transfer it to

826
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,580
the world for you and listen to

827
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,490
on depending on the city on news crews
you know about that I

828
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:23,609
know some cases a farm news crews that
would go around when know about K

829
00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:27,170
there's a merger coming up the company
XYZ we're gonna stick someone outside

830
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,250
that and

831
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,780
get some information I at a place I
worked up before

832
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,770
was a fairly financially conservative
bank but they still decided to spend

833
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,950
hundred thousand dollars to have people
follow around in suite for transmitters

834
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,339
look for it in a things like that bugs I

835
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,460
you know we tend to imply they saw some
value in that because they were fairly

836
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,490
versus spending money on security

837
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,859
next look at switching from digital
switching to destroy a trip to Grady

838
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:54,619
owes

839
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:58,260
for did a radio as most it on its gonna
stop the casual observer

840
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,270
you have real concerns go over to
encryption make sure its real encryption

841
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,490
a lot already manufactures use of things
that are encryption but they're really

842
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,290
just like boys inversion

843
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,660
are very other simple techniques I can
easily unscramble also make sure it's

844
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,670
using some like Dez

845
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,369
a yes some other than they have
published not just something event

846
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:17,020
occurs oh yeah

847
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:22,540
it secure we include invent a desire for
them it has to be fine

848
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,869
I had one vendor or other defense that
my basic question it like well the white

849
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,160
house uses it so it has to be secure

850
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,220
my okay I still need to know more
information about character in

851
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,230
triplicate

852
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,609
so make sure its actual adjournment
encryption next

853
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:40,350
private cheaper sensible thing to do is
a stranger guard force be aware what

854
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,040
they see an array is in public

855
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,580
is astonishing to stuff I for dark
forces say

856
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,619
everything from just leaking information
as inappropriate

857
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:52,839
arm had a case of a cup is doing a
summers and acquisitions

858
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:56,920
and you know there is a known this new
media fear 3 comes looking at buying it

859
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,960
say listen to it the Garza like the
representatives from company XYZ are

860
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,720
here to see the executives in my gallery
of

861
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,080
I you know the summer stuff like that
additionally

862
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,839
I for damaging things in terms of
everything from cursing at from

863
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:17,140
lewd jokes racial references all sorts
of stuff go to radios that they've got

864
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,930
to the press

865
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,140
would be a huge reputational risk the
company are such as nursing of

866
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,480
you know again news media's do you
listen to this obvious you listen to it

867
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,270
make sure the guards are what they're
saying to be heard by anyone just so

868
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,450
today

869
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,540
think about what's being forecast in
public

870
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:39,790
yeah

871
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,619
on question is a wireless PC keywords
potential has subsided a

872
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,910
um allow those devices can be
intercepted

873
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,950
other guys had to backtrack made the
like the cricket you are a

874
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,859
not sure quite how to pronounce that
they made a border is actually bill to

875
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:55,560
receive that information

876
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,580
are again depending on the device some
using corruption

877
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,830
festering corruption some the actual use
encryption

878
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:08,049
I am a lot to benefit throw to best
defense there's one appreciate range

879
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:11,280
however there are definite vices
accuracy vaughn even a Bluetooth

880
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,490
depending on how encryption setup

881
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,069
appalachia is a pretty good job with
their encryption on the Bluetooth kazi

882
00:50:17,069 --> 00:50:21,150
encryption key is fairly long a lot a
Bluetooth devices for encryption just

883
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,140
used to Kiev

884
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,540
you there no key 11 1000 or 1234

885
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,930
so it's a pretty small keys this I'll

886
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:36,930
you know so kinda depends on on the
technology there

887
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,230
i've seen demos at a copters other
events

888
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:45,970
I would more things actually you wanna
get is some like what mints kinda by my

889
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,339
hobbyist list of things to do to see

890
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:51,850
how far we could receive it for a
generous in the past

891
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:55,690
unless you have general arrange a
licence is pretty pretty poor

892
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,790
you have specialized equipment but
definitely to try than real world

893
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:05,790
yeah

894
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:16,590
out nice

895
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:21,209
yes I mentioned USENIX paper those up on
basically

896
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:24,880
a in our study said the transmissions
want and more interesting says

897
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,979
cable transmissions a few saying um the
pipes inside the building is actually

898
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:29,509
the antenna

899
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:33,839
which is a great idea which I will now
be tried in the service rooms to have to

900
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:40,839
play around with

901
00:51:44,649 --> 00:51:47,859
okay there's it looks like it's actually
just the the typing in the ground

902
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:48,659
returned but

903
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:54,439
nice

904
00:51:54,439 --> 00:52:01,439
yep

905
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,560
basically

906
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,009
time a potential for condom animal
attacks can you get

907
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:41,250
had said the pair to another device in
major traffic

908
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,590
yes trigger me think you try somebody
else arm

909
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,270
theoretically allow definitely possible
for Bluetooth their different tools out

910
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:48,830
there

911
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:53,069
to do that car whisper by the trough in
a group is one yr actually well

912
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,190
pair up with cars headsets start
injecting traffic

913
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:00,200
for the headsets now try also be
possible

914
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,770
generally that scenario already too much
in I just because

915
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,560
now to karma transmits which the FCC
looks down upon a special the ham radio

916
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,440
operator and only have the ability to
say I didn't know

917
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,300
arm so generally that's an area that I
am right foot around too much with a

918
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,790
theoretically definitely possible

919
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:20,320
pics so with that

920
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,870
finish up with all your are a far belong
to us

921
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:27,390
and open up the questions

922
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:31,629
for a more information check out secure
said dot com

923
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:36,280
also my blog scares as a blog and yet
security-related I do this post on

924
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,530
securities bought my blog into some
other personal stuff on my blog

925
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:44,520
there's my email address also on Twitter
the one final thing also just as a kind

926
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,830
of plug my company

927
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:49,270
if this is really cool stuff you want to
do we are hiring

928
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:54,420
so definitely come up are looking for
couple experience folks that have a

929
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,620
experience penetration testing capture
flag other saying so you also at times

930
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,009
higher into level folks

931
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,530
so if you know folks are if you are
interested in to field if I come up

932
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:10,530
talk to us when that relevant questions
yeah

933
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,730
yes arm

934
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:27,520
party that would be just knowing if it's
outsourcer security guard company

935
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,870
then you can look up by you wanna do
searches for a guard frequencies again

936
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:32,940
sets courier company

937
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,280
other thing could be depending on the
company involved

938
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,370
in the area I F I know the areas I work
for

939
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:45,140
the there certain guard force companies
that use far less training than others

940
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,540
us so that would also tell me if they're
using guard force

941
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,650
axe most likely their guards are you
know

942
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,200
college students which are working their
part-time and I basically

943
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,870
I'm really have no training no care
verses if it's a

944
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:03,529
your car company that uses armed guards

945
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:07,100
very well-trained other things just
knowing the local areas are working I

946
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,890
can be helpful

947
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:14,890
on yeah I got to provide also you can
impact how you then approach to testify

948
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,560
no

949
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:22,220
you know company a is a very yeah uses
is outsourced our company and its

950
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,620
a good car company in the area all-pro
to define an F I know they're going to

951
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,660
be very poorly trained

952
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,720
of

953
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:36,720
yes

954
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,300
I am did not a bag in a previous job

955
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,800
I will say new stuff is found

956
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,860
I you know the vast not talk about
whatever stuff was found you know I

957
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,230
guess

958
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:55,310
the general thing I would say is you
know as a company that

959
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,910
was very concerned about money that is
being spent you know we pride had

960
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:02,759
usually couple hundred thousand dollars
for the gear

961
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,420
as well as for guys that would be
devoted to doing this type stuff

962
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:11,350
arm though travel around following
executives traveling outside the country

963
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,150
with them

964
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:16,290
you know so they they saw some return on
an investment are also probably would

965
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,150
have kept on doing it

966
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:22,610
arm the other thing a lot of stuff that
we found was more stuff that's

967
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:26,920
kinda accidental stuff you know in terms
of like the headset to transmit all the

968
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,870
time other bizarre stuff like that

969
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:34,609
I am near thing is hotels a car that
frequently hold conferences

970
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:39,380
are usually pre-wired for bugging and
people can just bribe the people there

971
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,630
so they don't need actually getting

972
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,100
arm so high-end hotels that car that
usually all conferences

973
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,280
I'm going into them can be challenging
cuz

974
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,950
in some cases are actually hard wired
and you know have basically been

975
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,820
very nice professional jobs installing
microphones and stuff

976
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,650
so there's there's on stuff out there on
as a

977
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:03,100
interesting thing to play with if you go
to a site Tsem dot com

978
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,520
here's a list of the most common
frequencies if you have a scanner just

979
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,940
program that an answer driving around
major cities

980
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:12,290
and its you may hear some interesting
stuff

981
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:19,290
yeah

982
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:28,910
here

983
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,240
yes that's a great point bases
mentioning a certain Verica

984
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,490
scanners have a got a feature called a
frequency stalker

985
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:42,520
which base you a lock on to a strong
frequencies in the area so similar

986
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,720
functionality this guy I'll just find a
strong the frequencies

987
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:52,160
and the 7 a memory ok

988
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,660
a la the consumer on skis may also have
I am features reassert just can't

989
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,870
abandon all savers in it fines

990
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:02,319
in me. times is found to be helpful if
you don't know where they are but you

991
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,910
know frequency range set that up

992
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:07,160
be to go for half a day comebacks US at
the most aren't listening to them

993
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:14,160
yep

994
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:32,380
yes I came out on a good source for soft
defined radios company called when radio

995
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,760
dimension that can be found on TV get
the old ones used

996
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,460

ronny start to get into it just starting
out going to

999
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:50,069
on my favorite things you find a series
after the radio system to something it's

1000
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:51,359
like trying to digital

1001

if for battery is dead

1027
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:50,309
our own yeah there there are radio
systems out there which will you spence

1028
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:55,819
spread spectrum on tetro is one that you
some interesting for dance got the mail

1029
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,529
in Europe I am but a lot of like a

1030

higher andrea is a circus EU's well it's
your service other ones

1031
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:05,510
were you spread spectrum and actually a
lot of

1032
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:08,880
federal agencies are getting away from
individual handled radios

1033
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,799
and axes Nextel radios with customs
brokers

1034
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:17,559
a and out again use on freezing up in
other technologies so that it does come

1035
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:18,280
into play

1036
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,289
are you gonna find out it a consumer
side

1037
01:01:21,289 --> 01:01:24,859
probably not because they're not gonna

1038
01:01:24,859 --> 01:01:28,240
pay for that functionality but it is out
there

1039
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:34,069
fourth sup

1040
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:39,029
for well defense

1041
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:43,980
you yeah that's more what will you get
into it down

1042
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,170
getting like using it on block scanners
in the United States for corporate use

1043
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,190
if the for testing

1044
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:53,630
so if you go through felt paperwork you
can but usually in the budget stuff from

1045
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,390
that's where

1046
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:58,480
yeah I had some amazing radio toys that
way to Tsem work

1047
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,849
a where right now you know that the
budget slashed because

1048
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:07,010
we don't need to spend you know tens of
thousands of dollars in fertilizers much

1049
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,460
as I would love to have on the play with

1050
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:12,369
yeah even is a great place university
labs

1051
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:16,869
you're using it

1052
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:22,910
your YouTube runs up your nose

1053
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,259
year yeah

1054
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:30,319
for the hobbyist level stuff and stuff

1055
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,140
stuff sir

1056
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:36,400
tons of options and that's one plus a
lotta you know how this movement for

1057
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,420
cheap budgets

1058
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:44,420
