1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,330
these guys not really johnny-come-lately

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,820
to the Internet seen back in the old
days backing aging history back and

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,610
all say the nineteen seventies arm

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,860
phony invoices games were pretty common

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,130
on they started off

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,509
with telex directories now

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,460
I really can't say have a claim to fame
is being a telex acker back in the days

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,960
because

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,970
in those days telex had no fame telex
was just

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,520
a business to business teletype network
that nobody really played with

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,520
but I was offered computer time on HP
2000c time-sharing system

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,459
out at the State University York at
Brockport twenty miles outside of

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,950
Rochester my hometown

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,140
I could be either take the Greyhound bus
out there

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,449
or find a computer terminal with the
dialup modem and I want to thank

16
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:59,670
but we're talking the 1970s year

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,879
are terminals with modems were not

18
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,390
that common in those days but I'm
walking past his office one day

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,960
and there's a model 33 teletype with a
dialogue Twix machine

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,020
scratch scratch scratch what's it which
machine well

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,250
TWX did for teletype writer exchange

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,520
arm not telex itself

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,460
is a five-level Bordeaux system while

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,540
the Twix network which is owned by AT&T

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,560
are was a7 model ASCII

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,040
actually 8 that with parity using miles
with you tell types

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,780
%uh telex really are came from Europe

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,130
a there's a cable that want from

29
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,970
a lands and in England to Newfoundland
in Canada

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,679
was brought across washing is next line
down for Montreal for things off in New

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,729
York and an expanded across the country

32
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:59,180
I'm AT&T saw this other business to
business communications markets I hate

33
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,310
we want some others action arm

34
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,280
thereof the teletype Corporation was
formed to manufacture teletype equipment

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,120
it was fifty percent owned by Western
Electric and the other 50 percent owned

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,060
by AT&T

37
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,340
so was basically all owned by AT&T the

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,420
I'm in those days you Western Union
would publish a telex directory

39
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,000
the big international firm was yegor
while the men have germany for the

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,700
worldwide telex directory there was a
really good book

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,730
but the scammers will get a whole these
directories

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,869
and send out phony invoices for their
own

43
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,970
telex directory and you know usually
just

44
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,790
if it goes a large have come because you
can Department 0 a directory well I

45
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,329
guess

46
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,390
we need to just pay this bill and those
games to get away with that

47
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,550
a in many cases you know it said that
hundreds of invoices get maybe

48
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,500
10 replies but because they're charging
so much admit the milling worth it

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,530
to them anyway I am

50
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,590
these days when I go to look back for
something like that all I can find

51
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:10,590
are links that refer to phony
advertising solicitations

52
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:16,340
which job start of a bogus Yellowpages
bill that

53
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,069
I'm sure so goes on and under phony fax
directory schemes

54
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,810
we find that they worst

55
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,370
telefax Intel X directories as

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,500
a you know somebody's fraudulent
directories are you

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,230
being billed for and to watch out for
all

58
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,870
by the way I'm doing my links from my
website a Cheshire cat was dot com

59
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,349
slash domain dot HTML

60
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:50,280
up is just are thrown together web page
PowerPoint I find is the greatest thing

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,959
to help sleep since I'm attacks and

62
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,189
b-sides the Microsoft product so I tend
to simply

63
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:00,500
white web pages throw them up are

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,019
blow them up on all the screen to to
show as

65
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,569
my notes and ready for the webpage above
my website if you want to get to these

66
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:09,200
nights so

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,599
later and to follow the whites arm

68
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,340
out in Australia there is a telex
morning

69
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,949
on scam watch scam watchdog up .au

70
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,990
about directories are never causing
false billing

71
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,120
and oh here we report them if you're an
Aussie and things like that warning

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,620
signs there was a pic of a business
director of public if you've ever heard

73
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,669
of blah blah blah

74
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,729
and this is how the the telex schemes
used to work

75
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,159
well the fax machines and email

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
kinda killed off telex arm

77
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,460
AT&T sold the Twix network to Western
Union

78
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,070
are back in the late seventies and in
fact are

79
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,169
the combined telex record the first one
in 1973

80
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,690
about I was looking through your the
directory which of course is public

81
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,100
information to pick one up

82
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,090
but because it was AT&T their
directories were in their standard

83
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,740
telephone kinda format

84
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,520
you have a state within each state would
have cities and witness it is you have

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,909
to listen for that city

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,949
what you just want the whole stay
together cuz it was business to business

87
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:14,419
in the

88
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,330
you know people from all over say would
be doing business with each other but

89
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,159
AT&T still have their standards from the
phones over how so

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,930
it that way i'm looking through the
telex directory

91
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,720
for the state of Virginia one day it
works director rather the AT&T site

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,229
and I notice a little town with an
unusual name

93
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,520
and 11 listing in the name of the US
Department of Agriculture

94
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,210
now I could just imagine the scene as
the guys

95
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,888
at his office are getting their twats
machine and they're filling out the

96
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:45,830
forms

97
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,849
and it says what you coming all well

98
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,530
with the US but the veteran just perfect

99
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,740
City all you can tell you that its
classified

100
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,360
their listed as classified Virginia

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,919
is the US Department of Agriculture

102
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,930
so you can just imagine who actually
operative that works authorship

103
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,470
I so paranoia strikes the

104
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,860
yes um so basically these kinds of scams
have been around awhile

105
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,110
they just got themselves and so now
they're adapting to the Internet age

106
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,560
where we have the a

107
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,750
the main expiration notice it goes out

108
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,319
hopes you make and %uh

109
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,940
you can see from the billing cycle here
it's so thirty dollars

110
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,550
for one year sixty dollars for two years
Sucher

111
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,210
arm they're really trying to scam you
well I'm sure

112
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,819
I know my registrars watch people than
that

113
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,169
and

114
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:57,508
so that's out there

115
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,789
a under domain names you'll find people
warning you against this outfit

116
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,889
arm domain registry of America scam as
wasn't here under

117
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:11,099
are you can which is the utility
consumers Action Network outlive San

118
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,400

119
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,660
arm that got all search for information
about it

120
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,310
warning people about this sort of thing
arm

121
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,380
it's not new Wikipedia itself has a
listing

122
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,360
and it's interesting because it says
this article has been %uh need to be

123
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,410
checked for its neutrality

124
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,410
I mean if you're talking about a scammer
you mean a big mutual Pawan

125
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,229
in your discussion above the scammer of
this article may be inaccurate

126
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,620
in or unbalanced Ford certain viewpoints
many people thought like this guy

127
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,130
so it it may reflect that in the

128
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,539
Wikipedia listings are you should be
warned about that arm

129
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,650
and it's got the usual external links to
federal trade commission for two min

130
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,129
registry of America

131
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,699
um you all sorts of things that you
might want to look up

132
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,650
so you can follow this link for my page
in and get there and see all that

133
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,180
the perk this is their website domain
registry

134
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,319
other America arm and I'm

135
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,490
interesting touch demands that the favor
icon

136
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,270
does show a pseudo American flag you

137
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,750
and yet if we look back in the Wikipedia
listing just

138
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,639
to be sure will see that I am

139
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,470
web hosting service really basically in
province of Ontario

140
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,669

York

141
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,349
I'll and

142
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:36,909
at sea

143
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,328
so of course they no show North America

144
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:44,039
UK in London and Australia New Zealand
other bob in Australia

145
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:50,930
I'm was like an ordinary have website oh
and looks all take MasterCard Visa or

146
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,060
American Express

147
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,500
so the banks don't care how money comes
in

148
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,630
course you can register your domain
renewed

149
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,820
all that stuff but just with mister
comes in the mail

150
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,220
take a look at it if it's not for your
registrar

151
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,950
is probably what these guys trying to
get you switched over to them as a

152
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,839
registrar

153
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,240
and that's with love these things you
doing arm

154
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,810
they have misleading text but if you
read them closely

155
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,540
are it says exactly that you don't have
to pay this this is not an invoice

156
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,920
so many people do not

157
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,469
read things closely up

158
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,779
I mean people here are a little more
skeptical than others when when

159
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,630
things coming like this book really you
wouldn't you to watch the sort of thing

160
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,260
and be careful you're not taking him arm

161
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,810
I had meant this to be an interactive
discussion because I figured there might

162
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,519
be some interesting scams

163
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,630
folks out the audience know about I and
had hoped to

164
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:59,199
have a microphone out there %ah

165
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,329
you could come up and discuss the domain
theft that has happened to you

166
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:05,810
it we'd need to can make fun

167
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,329
minor our matter

168
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:13,640
I remains are all

169
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,640
registrars

170
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,790
this

171
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,430
work

172
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:38,430
ours

173
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,290
you you know I'm sure upset is not the
word but a

174
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,140
your rare oh yeah I love

175
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,180
I know that the I can receive the bunch
complaints about certain which drugs

176
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,060
like that

177
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,260
a who had just out now stolen

178
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,700
registration on domains and

179
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,850
go the back and pleaded could come up

180
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:17,709
Mike

181
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,959
I just like to point out to a lot of
people looking to register domains

182
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,279
that some domain checking if a domain is
registered

183
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,240
is actually a scam so if you check type
in to be Derby Day view this is my

184
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,680
domain dot com into their checkered they
actually

185
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,079
register that domain why check for in an
attempt to resell it to you

186
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,300
at a higher price so be very wary have

187
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,089
whom you're checking if the domain is
registered with before you purchase it

188
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,149
trying go through popular official
channels just to make sure you're safe

189
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:55,070
I've no such a thing myself or I will
just have tried to maintain to see if

190
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,570
it's available in two days later it's no
longer available

191
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,350
so what I've gotten used to doing now is
logging into my registrar

192
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,350
and using their who is on as I'm using
go daddy:

193
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,589
and on a figure

194
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,170
once I'm log in amman H GTP

195
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,889
ass for secure up your people can't
watch over my shoulder to see

196
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,300
what domain names I'm checking out and
I'll you know

197
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,410
try two or three before so on once I
really like arm

198
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,649
for example won the things I'm doing
these days

199
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:35,810
0 you have them for a decision sir

200
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:42,810
turkmen see phone friendly

201
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,260
dot com is a one minute remains one
answer to do is our reading web pages

202
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,350
for mobile phone browsers are those my
fancy me recall on

203
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,920
past years I've talking about whether
accessibility and making web pages

204
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,829
accessible to all browsers

205
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,470
I finally stop beating my head against
the wall with flash

206
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,680
I've just given up answered simply

207
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,819
reading pages for smaller web browsers
that can handle flash up

208
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:12,120
right now Apple is my hero for %uh
weaving flash

209
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,930
of the iPhone and iPad because it really
just sucks bandwidth

210
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,760
arm for eye candy that real mostly
contains no content

211
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,500
we're using it for instructional
purposes that's good

212
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,600
but for just advertising web sites it's
it's just ridiculous

213
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,300
to waste peoples time particularly low
bed with devices

217
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,439

235
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,800

236
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,850
the main road for america and others
urged yes

237
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,189
back okay

238
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:59,399
get back in the old days

239
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,870
I'm there was a similar phony invoices
cam on that was centered around

240
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,290
business business registries in listings
and a few anyone

241
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,360
recalls think all the times register
because encyclopedia

242
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,709
businesses and did to advertise you have
your company in every district was quite

243
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,149
a bit of money fewer dollars a year

244
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,290
so course the worst games like this that
would say own you know what

245
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,519
you know any list your company in you
know our our registry something while

246
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,370
times these invoices

247
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,089
income for six hundred dollars they
would just get paid out and

248
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,120
and actually that's a scam that still
persists to this day I still see these

249
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,350
invoices coming your way

250
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,380
it's more related to like search engines
like you know be listed on our search

251
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,860
engine

252
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,390
you know he's an invoice for six hundred
dollars in the fine print says you don't

253
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,740
have to pay it but

254
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,000
at you know to your point about a lot of
people still be in and I'll up a lot of

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,559
people

256
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,179
you know from haven't caught on that
these are de beers him so these

257
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,250
he's paid his act sometimes get these
invoices from the county department like

258
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,040
should I pay this you know what it is
about

259
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,649
so you know this is kinda first game
still exists

260
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,709
and right with my friends ASI hands
workers

261
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,490
you this second phase the audience yeah
a couple other thing i've seen

262
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,010
and I'm gonna be domains and one of the
things to come organization to Hong Kong

263
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,649
that will send you email saying I see
that you have something dot

264
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,929
net heard outward registered you need to
protect your identity

265
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,470
and so we can get you the dot-com for
only $99 dollars you ought to act right

266
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,309
now

267
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:30,730
and they say like we own it and like we
would like to sell it to you for ninety

268
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,350
nine dollars to reality is you said if
you go through your own registrar

269
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,439
HTTPS they don't own anything however as
soon as you express any interest with

270
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:40,069
them

271
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:43,689
they're gonna snag it now the thing is
that somebody's registries

272
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:48,569
be have been snacking domains and kind
of kiting them kinda like EF hutton did

273
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,600
and so you couldn't you've got something
like seventy two hours to get the money

274
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,579
I can

275
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,350
if it doesn't go they drop it but then
they had a couple the setup where

276
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,990
they've been cutting millions of domain
names

277
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,600
basically any type a search engine or if
you go into some but the things that

278
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,870
will allow you to say hey what terms
have been searched for

279
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,850
the you say hey wow someone searching
for this will go ahead and start cutting

280
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,790
it around and if you say that you want
it

281
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,699
the game stops the lock it down 99 bucks
199 whatever it is that you want to do

282
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,860
probably 10 side asia's ones that i've
seen. involves the paper

283
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,439
invoice which use not an invoice and it
comes from the UK and I get this about

284
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,110
every six months is a 2,995 dollar
invoice

285
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,980
for 12 special reports and it sent to me
at a special address that I only use for

286
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,640
my domain registration so I happen to
know we could trace it back

287
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,429
and I can see that if the company were a
little bit bigger

288
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,559
as compared to some other so small
entrepreneurs it might just go right in

289
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,210
the Accounts Payable Popham

290
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,520
and a guy gets it now he specifically
says at the bottom the

291
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,379
technically this is not an invoice but
if you're over 50 years old you can read

292
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,290
it it's in Presby a pic five you know
but

293
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,639
4.0 and so I can see how it

294
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,790
you figure okay what's it was supposed
age for mailing that stuff ass not 41

295
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,928
cents actually comes from US but its
return address from

296
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,780
from the UK so koresh 44 says maybe
fifty cents well how many hits the you

297
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,049
need

298
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,210
at 3,000 bucks to make a fifty-cent scam
work

299
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,340
and see if I know very much like spam
this thing scales pretty well

300
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,840
and I just got to be careful about that
I'm so anyway

301
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,658
I use the same register in general as
you do the Go Daddy is HTTPS

302
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:30,659
and I we know what you like things in
there it's pretty good

303
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,669
and I you can protect your investment
and protect your wallet from somebody

304
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:34,299
else

305
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,540
basically trying to catch on a slow day
to

306
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,340
shorter I first hippie

307
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,809
send it back chart yeah I was abby
hoffman still this book we remember that

308
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,200
request for the sixties and seventies
which basically said if you go to big

309
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,960
corporations take that business reply
mail

310
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,110
and glue it to a brick and then let them
pay the postage back

311
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,130
here domain names

312
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,820
go showing growth soca but again they're
gonna cut

313
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,379
by if they buy but again they've been
cutting I'm which means they don't put

314
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,640
any real money out

315
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,860
because I need to have is to domain
registrars

316
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,890
and then we as soon as this one's
already let go the next one picks it up

317
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,679
and you pick it up in you pick it up in
this thing just flies around the

318
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,679
internet

319
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,190
and I i yes it is a little bit more
sophisticated ever back in the late 90's

320
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,590
actually had a one letter domain
registered

321
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,980
because it at client site verification
on the minimum three characters

322
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,390
mile not to say that clan site
verification is it a good idea but you

323
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,610
can get one character domain the problem
is in the race start up their price cuz

324
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,909
it was a foreign nation

325
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:43,690
299 bucks a year and it really wasn't
worth the 199 bucks here to have a

326
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,640
you know keep you know one character dot
something something domain

327
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,540
although to date now with all the little
text messages that being a great URL

328
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,550
shortener

329
00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:00,470
mmm but an idea too far ahead of its
time is not worth the money

330
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,440
thank you I'm let's see

331
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,510
the any other story from the audience

332
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:16,510
ok yes

333
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,409
yet because somewhere in the ugh well
somewhere

334
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,020
in the the 0 the letter you get or the
email you get all the news you get there

335
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,879
is something that says it is a
solicitation only and not an invoice

336
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,020
and that protects them legally so

337
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,460
yes love they are protected as it were
from

338
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,440
are being brought down upon by the FTC
Federal Trade Commission and other

339
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,490
such agencies yes

340
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,930
this is kinda related domain name scam

341
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,530
from the mine is actually still doing
this he will send a spam letter to

342
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,050
an owner of a domain offering to buy it
for some large sum of money but he wants

343
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,530
to have to praise first

344
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,120
and your trusty third-party domain racer

345
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,250
that's the scam you pay the domain name
appraiser five hundred dollars

346
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,570
to figure out the value and by that by
the point by the time you've paid them

347
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,110
I'm well the initial offer kinda goes
away

seventies and eighties with a tap

and up but at the late 90's

378
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,260
my new claim to fame is that they were

379
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,700
splitting the 407 area code around
Orlando Florida

380

look into this love public hearing that
was coming up

385
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,290
and I went out to a website I knew about

Campbell the world head 32

396
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,640
one as an area code well it's time for
me to bring down the web browser

397
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,090
bring up the word processor and to begin
preparing my

398
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,790
are my testimony from Public Service
Commission hearing the back in

399
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,180
the 80s when 718 was put from 212

400
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,610
I went to the Public Service Commission
hearing and

401
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,440
learned a few valuable lessons because
you know all the little willies

402
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,970
you know and and and the seniors I'll
centers and nobody was there

403
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,400
deploring the extra vegetate have dialed
is that no

404
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,440
and I was the only person at the Public
Service Commission hearing

405
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,790
when this but 718 who said yes

406
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,470
of course it's a technical our
requirement that the running out a vote

407
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,920
numbers in the 2012 Rico

408
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,650
given to them by all means however in
return

409
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,750
why not remove the one dollar per month
touchtone fee

410
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,170
so that people could get touch on other
phones

411
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,610
and would be easier to the extra digits
oh well logging

412
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,060
blah blah blah this is not a rape case

413
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,320
and I'm as you're hanging around
actually went to every case

414
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,340
and discussed the matter their

415
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,320
I was most interesting a the from people
just

416
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,570
really hated to see me was wonderful up
but

417
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,909
getting back to Florida are having this
experience I knew enough

418
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,170
to print out copies as much as $20 for
each other commissioners

419
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,650
and one extra copy for the
transcriptionist

420
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,770
if you really wanna make friends with
somebody who cast make sure you cover to

421
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,490
cover for the transcriptionist

422
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,720
because nobody ever give them a cop your

423
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,850
so I'm I when

424
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,970
I made my little presentation you know
that not only should the

425
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,970
321 before the Space Coast Florida but
here's a printout from North American

426
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,130
demand by the administration

427
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:20,380
showing it's available so the way I like
to look at it is

428
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,510
I asked for it they approved it

429
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,770
so it must be my area code but I share

430
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:33,310
however I did save the best number for
myself

431
