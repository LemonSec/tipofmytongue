1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:05,609
you're doing missed help

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,870
on Michael sure are depressed 98 doing

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,059
showdown for penetration testers I

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,300
good afternoon everyone my name's
Michael shear the present any how many

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:17,980
people

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,449
I am talk about a a search engine called
showed and how many people have you

7
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,689
heard overuse shown an okay a fair
number good

8
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:30,529
I am wanna talk today about showed an
for penetration testers in using shown

9
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:31,000
in

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,059
you in ways that was not necessarily
intended

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,530
soma talk up talk a little bit about
love you

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,770
may have not even heard of show Dance
will talk a little bit about what it is

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,800
I am some basic operations

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,570
my talk a little bit about its
applications for penetration testing

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,910
which were not intimately intended by
the designer

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,030
I'm I put together a number of case
studies on

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,850
on showed an and and using its you find
in breaks at Burger

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,670
break sucks things I and then we'll just
talk about something

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,140
solutions so

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,510
I kinda put the slightly tommy's or
penetration testing in my title I i put

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,560
the slide in there because I want to be
clear

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,689
I'm I know what penetration testing is
an

23
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,740
is and know what all these things mean
and I i could make a very long titled

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,770
including all these things but I want
you to know that

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,189
if you do or involved in any of these
things that

26
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,790
that the title really does apply to you
so I think penetration testing wall

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,340
why don't you penetration testing but I
do viability assessment okay that's fine

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:33,810
it's

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,659
in in the definition of today up for
this presentation

30
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:41,400
its all the same thing I recognize that
that's not necessarily true but

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,130
just just go with me on that so few
involved in any stings

32
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,740
you know you may find shooting useful
for you so what he showed in children is

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,670
a search engine

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,899
I think well with this great as a whole
buncha surgeons and got their Google and

35
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:56,649
Bing and Yahoo

36
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,479
whenever I am I was developed by a web
developer

37
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,829
I'll name John madly whose out in San
Diego and

38
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,069
the difference here showing is that a
search engine in the same way that

39
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,140
Google or Bing

40
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,940
searches content and then and then index
it for you

41
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,390
on showed an actually I am

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,450
to the search engines were crawford et
tu on a web page or data on some sort of

43
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,069
server and that's that that's the
content is what is what you're concerned

44
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:24,670
about

45
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,370
shooting is actually I interrogate
sports

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,220
I and grabs the banners so your indexing
web banner sir indexing FTP banners

47
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,420
indexing some telnet banners

48
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,000
et cetera so instead of looking for cuts
that were looking for the banner cell

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,500
and serving a search engine of content
we have a search engine have banners

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,709
so why is it different well

51
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,069
instead of finding specific content in

52
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,390
on a web page what we're looking for
specific content in a banner

53
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,420
some love you know the banners of that
advertise

54
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,060
in very good information about what's
what's Cirque services are running

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,379
exact versions of services that are
running as we'll see later sometimes

56
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,239
banners advertise default user names and
passwords with it which is people don't

57
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,019
change

58
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,739
are very easy to get into so showed is
useful for finding specific notes

59
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,810
servers desktops which is

60
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,840
printers all sorts of things and
optimize your search results does

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,370
require

62
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,989
little bit of knowledge of what banners
look like so basic operations this is

63
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,870
this is what showed and looks like I I
know you can't see it but the

64
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,900
the URL is www tot

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,730
showed an HQ dot com which are reference
later but this is what it looks like

66
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,140
it's just

67
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,879
you know it's got a search box up here
in the top and then there's some

68
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,030
searches that are already some popular
and save searches on their

69
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,750
and I'm gonna go through different parts
this web page but there are also two

70
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,849
Firefox

71
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,840
add-ons for showed an one is a

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,230
search provider which at just ads a
search in the top box

73
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,700
on the top right hand corner CDA struck
down its like showed an

74
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,890
and then there's a a sidebar called
showdown helper

75
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,280
not going to talk about the other than
just to mention to you

76
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,380
some people may find these useful in
terms of

77
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:26,380
using shorthand I just on the web page
itself okay basic operations

78
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,719
in in some sense shown is just like any
other search engine just

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,540
you put search terms into a box but
obviously were not searching for content

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,460
on the page for searching for content in
the web banner

81
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,109
I'm you can use quotations to narrow the
search just like you would

82
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,620
and you can use the Boolean operators

83
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,460
a plus and minus to include in it
exclude terms whether plus is kinda

84
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,359
implied see you don't really need to do
it see Fig

85
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,620
use three different terms in your search
you're applying to all involved

86
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,110
the minus is actually useful because you
may want to exclude certain things and

87
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,070
we'll see that later on

88
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,759
okay I am you can you showed him without
an account

89
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,910
some people don't like to create
accounts that's fine there are some

90
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,060
limitations to using shown an

91
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,620
I'm but if you have one of these
accounts a Google Account Twitter Yahoo

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,970
AOL Facebook

93
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,169
Open ID you can use any of these to

94
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,659
to log into showed an we'll talk about
how gives you some additional

95
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,919
capabilities

96
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,289
are you can also create a showed an
account as well on it's not required

97
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,449
arbiters number filters such as country
and net that

98
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,090
there they will not work for you if you
don't log in

99
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,550
%ah also you will not see you look

100
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,650
you be limited in number search results
you can see

101
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,449
there's also an export feature other
last YouTube export the results that

102
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,070
you're seeing

103
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,750
and you have to be logged in for that as
well

104
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,780
and this is this is how you can login
you can see the number of two different

105
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,940
options there to log in or you can just
create a showing

106
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,819
account

107
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,710
there are a number of basic filters that
you can use and

108
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,888
the filter is actually the word that I'm
showing you in bold

109
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,319
with the colon and then whatever the
filter so

110
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,490
if you want to search for something out
a search for something and you only

111
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,850
wanted results from a certain country

112
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,720
you just use your search term and then
country colin and then the two letter

113
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,530
country code I am if you wanted I am

114
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,060
specific tax in a host name or domain so
I wanna search for this banner but I

115
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,720
only want to be in the dot gov domain or
the .eu domain

116
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,780
order dot whatever you know

117
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,090
I am the net filter allows you to
specific

118
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,180
filter by a specific IP range or subnet
so this can be useful if you're looking

119
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,430
for specific

120
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,830
if you're going after specific target
the OS filter for specific operating

121
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,900
systems

122
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,270
and pork for specific services right now
show dan is primarily

123
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,680
up or eighty but there is some port 21
22 and 23

124
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,400
and eventually there should be some
other ports being added but those are

125
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,599
the

126
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,060
large majority of what you're looking at
is going to be poor eighty so mostly web

127
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,250
banners

128
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,530
on this is just a couple different ways
to do this you can do everything through

129
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,389
the

130
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,639
through the search box there's also a
drop-down

131
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,229
I map you can just if you don't know the
two-letter country code for specific

132
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:24,469
country or whatever

133
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,780
you just click on the country some and
that the color

134
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,270
up the country kinda has to do with how
many hosts in that country been scanned

135
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,318
so you can see obviously the United
States China Germany Japan

136
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,910
have more hosted a min scanned on that
some other countries

137
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,520
you can also filter but for their UCI
down at the bottom there

138
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,520
again you can use the check boxes are
you can use use the the search box

139
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,470
I'm and if you mouse over a country
it'll turn yellow and I'll tell you I'm

140
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,069
a host or so United States

141
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:05,190
you know a lot

142
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,560
I talk to John who develop showed an

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,099
he's done large portions of the Internet
by I don't know what percentage wise

144
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,180
a not the entire internet but large
portions of the Internet

145
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,080
he's always adding more search results

146
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,449
so let's talk a little bit about some
basic searches and using some these

147
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,509
filters

148
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,020
so and I know you carry this enough but
i sorry them off to you

149
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,240
the search term then I use was Apache
and then country call in CH

150
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,870
ch is a is the is a two-letter country
comfort Switzerland so what's up with

151
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,760
its gonna find me is

152
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,269
I am any banner that has the word Apache
n

153
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:46,510
and then where the IP range is
registered to

154
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,589
Switzerland IP address so that will more
or less is gonna find me

155
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,980
all the a PAP at least what's been
scanned all the Apache servers

156
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,450
in Switzerland cue

157
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,980
or all the barriers that have the word
Apache and then and most banners

158
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,769
unless people change banners which some
people do what most people don't

159
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:10,490
so you can see the results here and
another little bit difficult to see

160
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,190
by to work the search terms that user
actually will be bolded here

161
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,779
on so this is the banner itself and then
this will actually I am

162
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,310
the IP address over here watch the link
you can just click on it go directly to

163
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,010
the result

164
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,529
and as well there's if the operating
system is identified you'll see that as

165
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:29,709
well over here

166
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:32,720
and sometimes this national flag

167
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,990
seeking you know pretty cool

168
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,070
this next term is a Apache 2.2 2.3

169
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,750
so I don't use a country code body
search for specific version of Apache

170
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,140
and you can see here that there are I'm

171
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,459
10 million results 1.3 million results
that have the word

172
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,740
patty 2.2 2.3 seek come see now if
you're looking for a certain version

173
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,920
software

174
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,920
or that you know there's a vulnerability
in a certain version of software you

175
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,550
might be able to find something

176
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,399
if you don't use a country code the top
four countries that match your query

177
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,850
will be linked to you you can see here
United States Germany France Canada

178
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,860
itself

179
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,540
the hosting filter so first example here

180
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,310
Apache hostname Colin dot missed at Gulf

181
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,140
so I will find all the Apache servers in
the darkness take up to me

182
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,260
okay we can do it

183
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,899
I S I am hyphen 5.0

184
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,589
hostname Colin .eu so I wanna find

185
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,980
all the i's' 5.0 servers Windows 2000
servers running in the

186
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,980
in in any EU domain can I find
absolutely

187
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,329
that filter I talked about LASIK refine
searches by IP insider

188
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:57,540
notation and then it was filter for Prof
by operating system

189
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,160
and the ports 21 22 23 and eighty

190
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,579
overwhelmingly is eighty

191
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,769
this number searches up so you login you
create an account

192
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,250
you find some interesting searches I'm
you can actually save them

193
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,149
so that other people can view them so
they'll be saved searches popular

194
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,250
searches others

195
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,690
share them with other users kinda

196
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,709
very basic Google hacking excepto and
hacking really in terms of saving

197
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,200
searches

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,140
I am there's an export feature

199
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,370
last export of a thousand results for
credits

200
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,130
you can purchase credits I am and then
there's a sample file to see what the

201
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,250
what the data export file looks like

202
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,500
I shot about the up by the way I have no
connection

203
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,010
other than I found this search engine
and I talk about it so

204
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,680
I don't get money or anything but so I
talking about what kind of feedback is

205
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,420
that cuz he just

206
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,349
recently added the the feature to
purchase credits he said the puppy that

207
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,170
feedback he's gotten has been positive

208
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,680
hit one person complained to him about
having to pay

209
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,769
to export the results I don't know I
don't I don't have a position on it

210
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:13,950
I know everybody what people think
information should be free somebody else

211
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,519
do the work you ask you to pay

212
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,579
if you want to do the export feature
that's up to you to decide

213
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:25,579
but I don't I just wanted a make clear
that I don't get anything out there

214
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,230
so when let's first talk to John about
this is what was your intent

215
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,160
love showed an and John the software
developer web developer doesn't he now

216
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,990
penetration tester is not involved

217
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,240
if a sec initially so he was thinking a
different marketing things and also is

218
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,260
it business reasons for showed an

219
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,459
and didn't really think it didn't really
go down that debt the the

220
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:48,070
the idea penetration testing although as
you can imagine when children first came

221
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,760
out

222
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,399
those of us who are in penetration
testing if a sack kinda look at this and

223
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,360
say wow those wonderful things you can
do with this

224
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,829
so that's kinda the angle that I went
down

225
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:03,240
so wanna talk a little bit about FX
before I move on

226
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,980
because as you think as you can imagine
so that things were going into you know

227
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,579
the could be questionable whether or not
you should actually be doing these

228
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,550
things

229
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,760
and these are cover to written questions
and don't expect you to answer I'm gonna

230
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,860
come to give you what my

231
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,990
what I think my answers were yours might
be different

232
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,810
so is it acceptable under any
circumstances to view the configuration

233
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,740
other device that requires no
authentication

234
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,910
you so if I go to one of these web pages
and it doesn't ask me for use them pass

235
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,089
where there's no pop-up box no nothing
it just

236
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,889
sends me write an authentication carried
you that

237
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,240
what about viewing the configuration a
device worth

238
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,380
maybe cuz your username a popup and I
put the default username and password

239
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,730
and it sends me right

240
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,240
without viewing that what about viewing
the configuration a device

241
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,910
using your YouTube username password
somehow I've captured the credentials

242
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,860
and

243
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,829
what about changing the configuration so

244
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:59,829
let's back up if you are authorized to
do a penetration test against these

245
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:00,959
things obviously

246
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,839
these are sticks things that you're
gonna be authorized to do i'm talking

247
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,130
about them from the perspective of

248
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,130
you gotta show dan you go home from hope
and you go to to be the video showed any

249
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,180
skewed acecomm

250
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,670
and you start looking at stuff because
that's why did I it was not authorized

251
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,750
to do any other stuff

252
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,149
show you I'm so what can you do

253
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,620
and this is the so this is the white to
black spectrum in this is kinda work I

254
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,910
put these things

255
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,990
some people might disagree that's fine

256
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,529
this is what I'm kinda my idea so
viewing something with North indication

257
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:29,970
at all

258
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,279
in other words it's just you have to
login I can see that fairly white I mean

259
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,680
I'm not changing anything interest you
in the configuration you know I went to

260
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,190
the web page

261
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,300
we will talk about a good example this
that I rant you

262
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,800
what about using a default username and
password will now you're actually

263
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,209
logging in

264
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,339
despite the fact they're using a default
username/password there is some for

265
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:50,829
storing

266
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:54,250
authentication there that you're
bypassing or that you're you know

267
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,170
using so I think that that's probably
you know questionable

268
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,170
what about figuring out some unique
username and password I mean it's

269
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,649
I think it's fairly common dry and then
its she certainly changing the

270
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,560
configuration sums device without

271
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,110
having any on I mean I'm not sure you
get any further on that you know

272
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,839
yeah anybody every major disagreements
with this

273
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,350
mean do you think this is reasonable I
think

274
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,829
I can understand if you wanna shifted a
little bit here and there I mean it's

275
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:26,279
the whole idea okay so pen testing
applications have showed an

276
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,699
using shorthand for penetration testing
requires you have some basic knowledge

277
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:33,630
HTTP banners and what they look like in
and status codes

278
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,350
banners advertising service version
advertise services inversions

279
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,230
I am people sometimes people speak
painters how many you have actually

280
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,980
spoofed

281
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,170
a ban on devices that you own so

282
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,550
a some people not a lot so yes it can be
done and some people do it but I don't

283
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,389
really encounter all that much but it
does happen

284
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:57,680
so we are by using these banners were
kinda assuming that people aren't

285
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,630
spoofing banners and they might be

286
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,160
so you all know these codes anyway but I
think its use is useful to choose this

287
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,880
review them very quickly

288
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,350
because we can make some assumptions and
when we see these codes in a manner

289
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,019
so a 200 OK request succeeded in other
words we can view this page without any

290
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,949
sort of investigation

291
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:19,980
I'm or 301 and 302 codes I will
typically

292
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,850
in in the in the case have shown and let
me see a 301 or 302 there's like a DNA

293
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,519
anything at that webpage

294
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,170
it's either moved or on its it's not an
area where we can

295
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,360
we could see something I am 401

296
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,870
is a I am request requires
authentication

297
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,519
we see a 401 will typically be
confronted with a pop-up box

298
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,759
asking us for a username and password a
403 is a forbidden

299
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm it's not gonna let us see the page
there may be some sort of

300
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,889
filter something somethings preventing
us from getting there so I'm

301
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,440
the ones that we're really concerned
about our 200 which allows to go see the

302
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,649
page right away

303
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,560
and then 401 which the public box but we
may be able to bypass

304
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,740
so a a 200 OK banner I am

305
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,980
the page is going to go too far and it
without any authentication now there may

306
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,299
be some sort of indication

307
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,859
build into that page where we have to go
to go further we can release view that

308
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,179
page

309
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:19,079
I am 301 302 step they don't have any
data on so we can try to sell to those

310
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,770
out

311
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,760
talk about using the minus the filter
things these at this is where it's very

312
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,439
good

313
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,100
-3 a $1 -3 02 we can get those codes out

314
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,679
I'm a 401 unauthorized manner

315
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,240
usually has a align called the BWB
authenticate

316
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,140
and we see those we typically have a
pop-up box

317
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,760
and then some bears were actually
advertised false to say that the fall

318
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,970
his name and password is

319
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,750
XYZ so people change in the coming up
now

320
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,429
so I did a number of searches a number
of case studies one showed in

321
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:53,970
see what we're doing on time 20 okay the
first one is

322
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,500
I just wanna look up Cisco devices lets
you work on a Cisco devices are out

323
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,289
there

324
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,830
and this is the first better than I came
across so I just church

325
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,299
I just use the search term Cisco so I
can HTTP

326
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,700
401 unauthorized which is the first box
in

327
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,809
red and that's difficult to see and the
third line down is a 32-bit authenticate

328
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,520
basic ground level 15

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,168
or you access can tell you immediately
that this is going to be a pop-up box

330
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,450
asking me for username and password
which I don't have

331
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,570
I am okay

332
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,950
now here is a difference is good advice
this is a I

333
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,220
it set up a 401 we have a two hundred
okay we also have no double-double

334
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,010
authenticate

335
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,830
and we have a last modified line which
gives us a date/time

336
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,220
which today is initially matter but so
what does this mean well

337
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,669
let's go a little bit further here's the
2 Bears again side by side

338
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,850
when we see the thought we see the 4-1
in the 200 and

339
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,020
and what they contain actually not about
99 percent mutually exclusive

340
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,580
in other words I'm searched

341
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,899
to Cisco searches for term for Cisco to
a fifty thousand center

342
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,850
what happens is when we get a £200 okay
with the Cisco result

343
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,260
chances are there's no authentication
required not nothing

344
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,580
on and n what this means is there's
probably

345
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,570
in children right now at least 4200
Cisco devices that require an

346
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,629
authentication at all

347
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,840
not like not default username/password
like weird

348
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,100
we log right in okay so

349
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,890
I wanted to find a few these example so
I went to them

350
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,090
the first one a Cisco Systems 1812
switch

351
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,120
this name is which on those if you have
a minister to sacrifice is you know it's

352
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,710
kinda the older HTML

353
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,120
interface to the Cisco device and you
click on the number

354
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,669
for the level of access the you want so
if you want you know fifteen

355
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:51,940
which is like you know you just click on
it and

356
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,080
so obviously you get to this point you
with you would figure

357
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,309
taken 15 nominee at my username and
password and

358
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:03,110
then it's gonna ask you to authenticate
or it doesn't

359
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,000
and just like you write it now this is
the old interface L

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,150
you can either just type the commands in
the command box up there

361
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,730
or you know they have the the HTML links
for you too

362
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,010
to just do whatever you want to run
whenever commands you want

363
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,990
so I you know this is the Configure
command so can you run configure command

364
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,520
the agricultural execute commands

365
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,168
so I ran you know okay so let's go back

366
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:31,230
what was the first thing I talked about
viewing the configuration device that

367
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,730
you don't have

368
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,650
the requires authentication at all now
I'm just doing show command so I'm not

369
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,720
changing anything just seeing what I can
do so I did a show running-config next

370
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,210
give me everything I did a show CDP
neighbors and

371
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,919
which you know I'm not it's it's a CCNA
kyr Cisco guy but I so but I know some

372
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,570
basic stuff so I just wanted to just
kinda see what's up

373
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,559
so this is an example of us a Cisco
device a switch that's available on the

374
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,270
Internet

375
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,280
that requires no authentication at all

376
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,399
to log into now are all these devices

377
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,539
juicy targets no maybe some guy has this

378
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:12,080
is doing a CCNA class in a separate
Cisco switch to play with

379
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,080
and I'm sure something mr. but there are
some legitimate targets out there

380
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,350
on does anybody know what I know you
can't see this time

381
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,299
on the CP neighbors if you look at the
first line

382
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,429
it CNN dash CN symbiote CNC what that
means

383
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,210
China Netcom yeah it's it's an ISP in
China so

384
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,909
CP neighbor this device is it is easy
and I've actually look into this a

385
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:36,700
little bit further is it

386
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:43,700
infrastructure device so I mean yeah
there are juicy targets out there

387
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,080
I am someone found a few a few more
devices

388
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,559
this is a Cisco Internet I am axis
wireless access point

389
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,629
now most home users don't use Cisco

390
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,600
they might use Lexus or other next year
but they typically don't use Cisco

391
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,679
devices

392
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,909
but some do I'm so this is the home page

393
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:06,030
Inc what about can review so this is the
home page

394
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,230
surely if we wanted to view I am you
know

395
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,280
this more configuration page is we we
have two authenticate now we don't have

396
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,700
to

397
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,940
so you can just you know go through no
secure

398
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,049
you want you want to add a password I
mean if you want to

399
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:23,080
what about Tom

400
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,620
turning on services sure why not i mean
the again

401
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,590
I'm sure your speech I T I can actually
change indicate figuration on the device

402
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,149
which would not be good what about our

403
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,760
the catalyst 2960 switch this one and
all of this is the same one I found this

404
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,919
a switch for a it was a realty company
in New York

405
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,600
and what they did was the switch minute

406
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,340
and they were very good about labeling
all the airports

407
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,760
to what businesses on what floors

408
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,470
had axis so I mean it was like 421

409
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,530
XYZ Corporation you know of

410
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,600
you know turn the internet off any

411
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,090
I'm and I'm yeah I don't know if this is
the same one

412
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,158
now this is the exact same one but you
can see that some people very good about

413
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,440
and turning on very descriptive about
their porch descriptions

414
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,020
you know the half duplex slowing down a
little bit or you know

415
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,139
but these things are just out there
these these are legitimate Internet

416
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:29,140
services that people are not what
they're running with no authentication

417
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,909
yeah it's okay so here's here's the next
thing

418
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:37,570
if you noticed I didn't blur out any the
IP addresses or anything

419
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,830
they're all out there i mean I'm not I
don't feel like showing its creature a

420
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,620
device that do requiring authentication

421
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,960
whatever I mean effects disc wanna I'll
get into a little bit about disclosure

422
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,490
later but

423
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,559
Cisco security device manager Express

424
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,559
more devices that you know
authentication at all

425
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,178
just to whatever you want

426
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,779
okay so that's a Cisco when I can use
that its first fiscal quarter

427
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,990
North education at all okay default
passwords

428
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,240
so this is the easiest search that I did
it was like incentive to searching for

429
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,700
I just search for the words default
password because sometimes banners will

430
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,340
say

431
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,389
default password is whatever

432
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,700
this doesn't mean every result will use
the default password but you know that

433
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,659
many do

434
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:30,289
some people don't change in Cisco the
lowest hanging fruit attack

435
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,559
this is the absolute first result but I
got

436
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,899
it's a 401 it's got a double-double
authentic a pair so we know it's a

437
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,250
pop-up box

438
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,360
and the default password is 1234 and if
you look at the web for its a print

439
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,929
servers

440
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,909
sis is actually what you doesn't mean
that they're using it but on

441
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:51,159
and there's no user name it just says
the default password still

442
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,610
we figure it's either adman roots

443
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,220
or or adjust and all user name

444
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,990
okay so this is what I got and you can
see that this is default password 1234

445
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,110
and I much so this is when those

446
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,740
she did should to try it

447
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,250
I it only took one try

448
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,480
I think it was no have anything things
and all user name and it was just one

449
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,570
two three four

450
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:25,760
now I'm occasionally you get into these
foreign devices are

451
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,740
outside the US devices where where the
encoding you disappear systems that set

452
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,570
up the views

453
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:37,158
you can see here that some other text is
just show up right

454
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,940
but I get you but you go through all
these

455
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,570
a different menus and do what everyone
when the things I found a show you this

456
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,309
later

457
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:49,129
is that lotta times if you can if if if
the links are enough

458
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,900
r for language or something donor stand
typically the underlying HTTP will still

459
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,870
be in English or something readable
secret

460
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,260
often just a mouse over the link and
then look on your status for the bottom

461
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,549
and actually see with those things mean
it

462
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,250
it's not so clear here peseta obvious
here %uh see an example later on

463
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,850
okay Weiwei IP phones

464
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,059
okay so I just wanted to find much less
isolated Cisco let's

465
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,299
go with my way see what's out there and
I did a while we search

466
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,450
and I am there's a whole bunch results I
am

467
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,980
and I came up with a lot of these and so
this is worse for using the filters

468
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,909
minus 41 -0400 -3 a $1 -2 you're too
because I don't want these results

469
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,460
I just want to hundreds so I just did
this

470
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,320
the search and I got a whole bunch
results while 280 some results

471
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,340
and they're almost all in the same IP
blocker this one 5186

472
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,520
and its why wait ET's 523

473
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,650
whatever and its

474
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,990
this is actually with the device is it
Eckel life

475
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:59,020
IP Phone if you look at the IP range
these are all in Venezuela

476
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,470
and you go get some like Technology
Corporation I'm gonna go to their web

477
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,490
page there's like

478
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,730
15 pictures if your child is smiling and

479
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:13,730
you know some some government technology
corporation

480
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,850
um and this was the so when you actually
go to the IP address this

481
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,510
this is what you're presented with and
arm

482
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,600
so again now we go back to I couldn't
actually find the default password for

483
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,390
root for this particular phone

484
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,950
but I found I don't remember an ass a
normal West

485
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,880
a bunch while we devices all have the
same it's his password or something like

486
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,669
that so I tried it can

487
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:44,740
and I all these tabs you can view and
change whatever you want

488
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,970
and I'm I kinda just scroll down just to
see all the diff

489
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:54,970
cheese ringtones reached

490
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,710
what's that absolutely yeah I mean if
you think about this

491
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,190
yet there's a lot of things are you
could just come play around with your

492
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,340
YouTube really mess up

493
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,880
someone's day I mean if you really
wanted to now

494
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,890
I don't recommend that you do this
unless you out authorization but

495
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,029
if you don't like the venezuelans than

496
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,919
you go last um

497
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,240
party the case study last case they were
talking is about infrastructure

498
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,510
exploitation

499
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:31,610
and when I first did this one is like
its kinda lame title so I just renamed

500
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,399
it to you

501
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:38,230
how to pole in ISP

502
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,080
now I will tell you in somebody's slides
I did I

503
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,760
I didn't black out some stuff now %uh ok
it's the reasons later

504
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,440
and it's actually

505
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,460
I should have read how to play nice P in
like 10 minutes or less

506
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,149
Without Really Trying because that's
about what it is so I was going through

507
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:56,159
these devices

508
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,779
you know the Cisco devices and I came
across this one

509
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,610
Cisco WS see 3750

510
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,649
the Cisco switch I'm same thing

511
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:10,029
same kind of screen we seen before with
just the HTML link

512
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm level 15 boom right in there

513
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,179
so I I started running just

514
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,480
IP routes use I'm interested the
different view

515
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,649
commander showing show commands to see
what's out there

516
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:28,330
and you can see I did like on some stuff
here running configuration

517
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,059
um show sleepy neighbors

518
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,158
0 this was the good one because it
showed me that there's some additional

519
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:36,840
switches

520
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,390
and then they have a Cisco router 7606
that's our core router

521
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,630
and at this point i'm looking at the IP
addresses and I'm like wow this

522
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,720
shouldn't be happening I'm

523
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,640
so without going into all this this is
what I saw in

524
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,240
in the early in the course about 10
minutes direct access to two Cisco 3750

525
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,880
infrastructure switches andress access
to their Cisco 7606 router

526
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,399
the UN ID's further internal ISP network

527
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,789
hotels in the area around the ISP
condominiums

528
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:15,309
apartments Convention Center public
backbone for the for their whole ISP

529
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:18,309
snmp-server I i mean

530
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:24,000
so can I go in here and route traffic
from the ISP to me and then back to

531
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,230
their network and then just

532
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,450
yeah absolutely do anything you want so

533
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,679
I'm gonna go a little bit into very I I
don't wanna make this into a big

534
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,640
disclosure today

535
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,890
but I am NOT a I don't find bugs in
software so I don't deal with this

536
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,450
closure

537
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,510
but I found this and I was like scanner

538
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,340
should do something about this so what
do you do you

539
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,070
so how do you you know we be talking a
disclosure weathers full disclosure full

540
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,600
disclosure would mean

541
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,610
XYZ ISP is paid do whatever you want me

542
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,730
right I mean there's no exploit but
there's

543
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,970
it would just be like advertising it and
saying you know some lights the best

544
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,450
disinfectant fix your shit

545
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,539
right well or

546
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:10,639
or that would be like the opposite would
be like no disclosure suggest

547
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:15,260
don't talk about it but i wanna talk
about it and then

548
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,500
the third path which where the company
in half which is I went down

549
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,980
which was a serve responsible sort of
disclosure

550
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,000
so what do you do so I went to the IP
address I found the security contact for

551
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,250
the

552
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,520
for the who owns a size P it's always
say I was

553
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,289
hacking your router and you no

554
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:38,440
so and I wrote about one sense in this
is why said

555
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,820
something like some other devices

556
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,990
up on your network appear to be
accessible without

557
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,750
any authentication something like that
just one sense

558
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,350
I don't wanna give him any anything else
on what I was doing case

559
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,350
I don't admit to doing something that

560
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,590
you know okay could've ports can be
considered malicious will somebody might

561
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,610
consider it the wrong way so that's that
they've literally said one sentence

562
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:13,020
and the next day I got an email back
from the sick from the guy

563
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,200
and he was like he was said this is this
is my first indication okay I think I

564
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,730
did the right thing he was very gracious
like

565
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,860
oh my god thank you you you see their
shit

566
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,860
and he's like can I call you

567
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,419
and I told you

568
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,490
I don't do this disclosure stuff so I'm
you know and I but

569
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,070
but I'm I understand that that people
are

570
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,249
interest that you know people I sense
that this was a good guy

571
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:49,629
maybe I was wrong Unohana so I

572
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:52,799
so I we set up a time when we talked on
the phone for a couple minutes

573
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,619
and he really just want to know how did
I find it and I don't really go into the

574
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:58,789
whole shooting thing

575
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:02,779
I just told him that I can add you
research on banners which I do I do a

576
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:04,059
little research on banners

577
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:08,809
and I told him that I was doing there
assert random search which I really was

578
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:10,149
I wasn't targeting him

579
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:13,169
and then I came across his device

580
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:17,080
iOS devices and I just you know if you
can have went into this

581
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,610
story about how some new guys said put
these devices up

582
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,710
and they didn't configure them properly
and okay

583
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,230
and in the and he offered me he said
I'll tell you how much money but he

584
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:29,960
offered me money

585
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,600
he said we'd like to send you a check
for finding this

586
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,070
because we want to thank you for so I
and II

587
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,350
didn't go I think demand money or
anything I go in there saying give me

588
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,809
money or I will expose you know I didn't
there was nothing I did I was just kind

589
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:45,999
of just doing the nice

590
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:50,799
I just be nice and tell you about so I
say

591
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,330
islet I send my address and

592
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,249
I know you know the next thing I'm
getting some like subpoena and there's

593
00:33:58,249 --> 00:33:58,929
no there's

594
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,570
to be honest with you I have not heard a
peep nothing at all

595
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:07,639
so I think either um they just decided
they didn't want to you

596
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:10,919
I'm or maybe they did more research on
me and saw that I was

597
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,460
I will tell you that in the in that I
talked about this one other

598
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,129
occasion and I didn't talk about the
disclosure part it all just I talk about

599
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:21,578
and I did not reveal any I still not
revealed who they are

600
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:25,579
so he may have said he may have looked
and said all the talking about you

601
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:29,639
I something to the name company whenever
cell um

602
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,879
whenever I think the side not any so
maybe

603
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,989
in a disclosure when someone offers to
pay you maybe she get it in writing or

604
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,919
something I don't know

605
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:40,739
but they offer to pay me and it was five
hours with after I mean

606
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,829
but that's pretty corny air Simon are
finding something

607
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:47,230
they didn't they didn't send me anything
and I'm not going to press it

608
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:54,230
at this point like Tom hey maybe there's
more of the ISP's out there were three

609
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:56,598
were some money

610
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,790
you know like I said I don't do this
closure things this was kinda my first

611
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,960
foray into the whole thing

612
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,150
but here's the thing I mean now
responsible disclosure is typically

613
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,069
okay you talk to the vendor and after a
certain period of time

614
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:16,079
you know you announce it for to be asked
me

615
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,319
I have no desire to announce with this
company is because it's its

616
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,660
great they're fairly small ISP and

617
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,799
me announcing it to the world does not
make it

618
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,349
if I could announce it to their
customers sure maybe that would work

619
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,450
but this nice to me there's no desire to
make a anything public yet

620
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,270
you have a question um

621
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,280
I did look a couple days later she Kylie
I haven't looked in a cup in

622
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,980
recently in the past few weeks he says
thanks to shut it down

623
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,339
I honestly I haven't checked recently
black to

624
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:55,140
yeah I mean that's probably worthwhile
to go back and see if they really did

625
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,319
fix it or if they just

626
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:59,420
maybe they think they fixed it but they
didn't you know maybe that was with the

627
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,670
case was in the first place

628
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:04,180
so yeah so that's

629
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,460
you know for those of you who don't
necessarily to disclosure thing I don't

630
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,819
to disclosure it's a bandana but I did
so

631
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:13,520
but when i think is a a fairly
responsible manner

632
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,630
couple other exam boards are some
general observations

633
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:22,630
okay this is just more of kind of fun
and up to talk with a fun thing so I S

634
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,650
5.0

635
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,930
Windows 2000

636
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,819
you know there's still lots from out
there course there was

637
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:35,020
you know 362,000 out there now there's
more to this is just for children's

638
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,579
capture

639
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:38,630
you can see where this is going

640
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:44,130
I is 4.0 almost 10,000

641
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,310
you going back

642
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,810
is like time travel right now flux
capacitor

643
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,170
381

644
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,900
does anybody know what I S 1.0 maps Q

645
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,040
Windows NT 3.91

646
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,470
three-point 9

647
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,790
I think either way it's way back it's an

648
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:14,060
it's in like 94 95 ish somewhere in
there

649
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:21,060
her 15 I went to a couple these web page
and it's like they set up the webpage

650
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,730
in like 94 95 and never touched it since

651
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:33,619
are still out there thank you now

652
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:37,869
the bank that I used to belong to

653
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,040
I wanted to them I went to their II
typically

654
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,349
when online and I went into their its
you up

655
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:48,730
whether local places which I'd never and
and they were running

656
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:53,980
NT among other things all so this stuff
out there means people that are using

657
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,250
these older devices

658
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,700
you know while its kinda scary

659
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,400
now you've all seen a

660
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,200
your Google hacking that every six
months

661
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,520
some local news channel rediscovers that
how you can

662
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,940
you video cameras on Google you know
this is a

663
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,099
Logitech wireless network camera in now

664
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:23,560
Japan I think and a

665
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:30,560
by the way I almost panicked albums they
work not at this screen shot but I had a

666
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,579
screen

667
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:34,990
I had an earlier time when all these
actually are all the ladies were sitting

668
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,990
there to task

669
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,890
house like up/down

670
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:46,890
left and right like trying to get them
to look would never look

671
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:54,090
there's no zoom actually and I'll talk
about that the second

672
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,310
um so

673
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,710
I'm the other there's there's another
reason to use the slide and I wanna show

674
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,780
you something else

675
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,950
so this is the page as you'd in Firefox
this is the peak so in this is what

676
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,640
this is one of those examples of where
when you mouse over look at the taskbar

677
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,910
so the camera up but if you don't we i
guess its

678
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,049
I think I believe its Japanese is a
snapshot so it takes

679
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,550
a snapshot that instead and then the
second but as a client that

680
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,810
HTML which doesn't really give you
anything but when you look at this

681
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,970
picture which is viewing in Firefox

682
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,920
and then this picture which is doing it
in their export actually this

683
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,890
I cap but its Internet Explorer you see
there's a third button there that isn't

684
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,250
rendered in Firefox

685
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,520
I so this is why I strongly encourage
people to view

686
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,930
if you're looking at web pages to view
them in different you know browsers

687
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,589
and and that actually comes at the
center consigue each year now

688
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:51,590
which it again you would not see that if
you were looking at it in Firefox

689
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,640
and I am NOT a I you guys but a

690
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,660
it's out there and this is what it would
take you to

691
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,670
and all those

692
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,330
all that although up Japanese over there
is

693
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,750
what's me again so this is where those
devices that you could do

694
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,119
United few you could just change things
left and right

695
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,820
whatever you want to do okay so

696
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,340
future I talk to jack shit so we want to
do with

697
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,030
showed I mean it's its I know he's his
cover blown away by all this penetration

698
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,340
says the fuck is not what he really
expected for

699
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,640
but I am so I thought we would be
looking at doing the future is talking

700
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:30,960
about

701
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,710
are an API for program interaction
integration sorry

702
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm the export option but to talk about
you must have some kind of a summary

703
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,310
report

704
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,130
he wants to give people you know the
bang for the buck you know he's asking

705
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,090
money from some people so we must be
given

706
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,320
their money's worth I want to talk to
include some fingerprints

707
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,490
and then he's also wants to collect its
TPS

708
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:57,680
may find some useful stuff in there okay

709
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,710
so could you

710
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,740
go home right now and do this

711
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,619
absolutely you could do this um you
could write the script in hand man up or

712
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:09,700
something and

713
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,970
and collect large amounts of data on the
Internet I'll

714
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,260
collect web and urs and and make them
searchable

715
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,660
you could do this but someone's already
done it so that's kinda that's kind of

716
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,250
the

717
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,770
the first point so were aggregating a
significant amount of information

718
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,590
that is an already widely available and
putting in it easy to understand for Mac

719
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:35,590
sessions a week reporting it also allows
you to think about it allows for some

720
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,580
sense of passive own ability and houses

721
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,529
because when I go to these um I S

722
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,020
5.0 or whatever 4.0 I

723
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,100
there might be a vote ability for
someone whose voice is that now

724
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,590
without me ever touching the target I
know that there's potential is that

725
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,320
they're horrible

726
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,750
I'm searching a particular domain for
two particular target a mine and I know

727
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,670
that they have

728
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,290
struck X number of Windows 2000 servers

729
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,420
have never touched her their IP space
and I know they make might be vulnerable

730
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,540
so there's a little bit a passive
ability analysis there

731
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,540
I'm now is shown in a takeover

732
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,190
no this is kinda wanted those tools that
you put in your toolbox

733
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,400
of well we look here we've got here

734
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,470
what about this can we can this find us
anything and it might

735
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,090
I think this is I think this will help
to shape for Billy assessments

736
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,359
and penetration test the future I don't
I can soccer your car

737
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,740
okay one more not done

738
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,680
I'm just

739
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,910
I know least there's no

740
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,499
views allies like in the background I'll

741
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:48,529
and annoying no

742
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:52,049
so I think this is gonna help shape

743
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:55,640
vulnerability assessment in the future I
think people can can and maybe find

744
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,009
something insuring that they don't know
it may help to

745
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:01,519
to give medicine additional information
John natalie:

746
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,210
his Twitter there's a sweater account
achille and and these are the guys about

747
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,839
those

748
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,049
add-ons for

749
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:13,440
Firefox we get to Cirque go to Firefox
add-ons for for showing

750
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,799
fine questions

751
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:22,140
how serious that a question yessir
absolutely

752
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:29,140
absolutely

753
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,120
right his comment was that it's not it's
not uncommon to find older systems

754
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,299
on also because sometimes things working
people don't wanna mess with them

755
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,090
and also I I know that a lot of order
you know SCADA systems and use all the

756
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,240
hardware and they're not compatible with
your stuff and

757
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,730
if it's not broken don't fix it
everything so it you you will run across

758
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:03,850
some other stuff out there

759
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:10,850
mayor he wasn't really looking in the
vulnerability

760
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,660
part at all she was asking about the biz
business applications I love

761
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,029
showed an he was looking for marketing I

762
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,930
he's is the developer guy so I don't
know his he wasn't looking for

763
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:35,930
for for phone down the path of all
abilities and featured

764
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:43,010
yessir

765
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,910
I am I don't he asked %uh

766
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,000
if there are any other tools simplex
similar to show in

767
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,810
do the same sort of thing there's a
couple there's some projects out there

768
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:57,670
there's a project which a is of I which
I can pick up the name of

769
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,860
which is intending to search every

770
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,700
HCP poor on the entire Internet can
report the date at which store the same

771
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,240
thing

772
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,330
but couple worldwide port scanner for
eighty I am

773
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:14,240
I wish they had the a the link and I
don't but that does the same for the

774
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,830
same thing

775
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:21,080
a job out to

776
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,240
to gather the data I talked to John
about this he said he wrote his own

777
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,160
I script to do to collect the data

778
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,810
I don't know exactly what if its Python
or Perl I'm

779
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,490
he didn't go into details bites I

780
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,920
its its kinda customize thing but he
said it was very easy to do

781
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,000
very fast he said anybody could recently
do the same sort of thing

782
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
in the back sir he's not collecting on
HTTPS yet

783
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,730
but he's talking about doing it in the
future he was a have the question was a

784
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,470
is he collecting Heps he is not
collecting on it yet but he thought

785
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,950
about the future or in the back sir

786
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:06,120
it just

787
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,920
eighty and then 21 22 and 23 right now
I'm if there are other ports

788
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,300
that you think would be useful I he's
always mention that you can just send

789
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,070
american

790
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,780
no on Twitter and say hey could you
clicked on this port he could be easily

791
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,310
at

792
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:23,890
I answer I am

793
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,240
IFE he just puts in recollect large
blocks love

794
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,290
and I don't know if he has like a
priority list love what he's looking for

795
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,550
hitting on a specific detail for you
he's always

796
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,370
adding large amounts of new data itself
but I don't know what his priorities are

797
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,100
questions about adding new data and how
we get it

798
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:47,110
i've seen

799
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,760
every week or so he's adding new data
and I don't know how often is going back

800
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,720
to the old data

801
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,170
I want the things you would typically
see on the

802
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,580
website is when it was added the result
see you may find that

803
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,040
you know that result is older but it
will typically tell you when it was

804
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,020
when it was added yes

805
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:14,020
arm

806
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,910
you could certainly ask him I don't know
if I'll give it to you but I think

807
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,210
he the question was could you could you
contact them to get this script to kind

808
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:21,720
of do

809
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,460
on internally for your site for your own
company wherever you can certainly ask

810
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,360
him I mean I'm not

811
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,800
I'm not gonna stop your stop you from
asking whether or not you could do that

812
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,020
five minutes to go any more questions

813
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:40,020
yes

814
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,329
I he question was about

815
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,670
any success in in looking at SCADA
systems ish terms of what you can do

816
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,950
with and controlling

817
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,479
valves in all sorts of things I A did
not

818
00:47:52,479 --> 00:47:55,599
I don't do a lot a skater stuff so I
don't really

819
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,710
gas to the I'm not really sure what to
look for so I haven't really

820
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,609
actively looking into what you could do
I suspect that you could probably find

821
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:04,529
something out there

822
00:48:04,529 --> 00:48:08,420
you could I don't know that you could
you know term term the house on and off

823
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,519
but you could certainly

824
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,089
probably get into some work do something
again

825
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:16,200
I from my perspective years trying to
give you know

826
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,880
what could you do as opposed to what can
you do because obviously that there's

827
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,059
there's a lot of maliciousness content
with what you could do here

828
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:28,289
sucks trying to like draw the line in
the sand and say okay I'll do this but

829
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:28,859
unlikely

830
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:33,140
for your questions think I'm gonna think

831
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,450
the hope staffer in the opportunity to
speak

832
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:41,299
this is a great conference its to come
to

833
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:45,160
its definitely more unique than I need
other most the other campuses that

834
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,529
that we go to in the community but I
it's really a

835
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:52,130
my favorites so thank you everybody
thanks for coming up here for

836
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:59,130
got and thank you

837
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:04,479
I'm just a reminder the keynote is going
to be simulcast

838
00:49:04,479 --> 00:49:08,229
in all three rooms I I'm not sure
whether this was gonna be open to the

839
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:11,200
other room which we do sometimes but
that might be one possibility so

840
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,739
it might be the one to save you seats
maybe maybe not other pending

841
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:17,799
others also be in love listening to be
in them on the big remember there
