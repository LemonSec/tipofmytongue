member I wasn't web sites where I see
that will open market a closed I just

19
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:07,390
assume

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,270
now I'm good everything's everything is
nice and safe turns out that that might

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,460
not necessarily be the case

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,630
are there some problems and there's some
good solutions out there

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,189
an hour such showing year's gonna
tartars marijuana

24
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:28,189
so on hi good morning

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,909
I'm over should I love you getting up
and coming out to hear me

26
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,439
own think it's pretty early I'm sure
many future

27
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,650
how many have you recommend he's here
talk last night cool

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,840
there seems to be rude huge contingent
have my keys for people rated

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,820
secular I'm a lot of the concerns that I
really talk about are actually the same

30
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,369
as the concerns that were expressed in
Macassar

31
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,759
and I'm scanners computer

32
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,210
with food lighting I'm I think gender
were expressed them more eloquently

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,640
Ben I i'm going to be able to you and
with cool diagrams which I don't have

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,670
so if you get a chance you should take a
look at the video

35
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,848
the monkeys here talk because I think
you will provide

36
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:15,170
really good explanation about some
concerns than you would represent

37
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,620
so a lot of you have probably heard
something like this

38
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,680
arm this is something that someone wrote
on the TLS list

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,050
about to weeks ago I love you may have
even said something like this

40
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,140
arm so the idea

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,280
in the conventional wisdom in some ways
third

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,730
it she did yes is for credit card
numbers I actually saw someone in the

43
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,369
elevator

44
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,349
with assured with a little picture a
padlock in it said disputes you can

45
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,619
trust me with your credit card number

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,690
on

47
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,050
I really want the truth but there's this
idea that this issue GPS thing

48
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,599
is for credit card numbers and that's
what it's for and you need to use it

49
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,890
there and you shouldn't do you expect to
see animals

50
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,360
I'm in the city has persisted to the
extent that someone is still reviewing

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,800
it on the US list like two weeks ago

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,239
and I sit in journalism about

53
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,900
its UPS and I see it all over the place
I'm

54
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,120
and obviously I'm going to say that this
new shoes

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,420
eroding and that's a good thing arm

56
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,209
there is good news for good reason for
this which is that netscape wanted to

57
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,640
reassure users that it was safe to send
their credit card numbers online

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,790
and to buy things online and so they
came up with this

59
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,459
original version SSL and he said okay we
have encryption

60
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,239
your credit card numbers are safe you
can feel confident we have these padlock

61
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,870
don't worry about it it's not really
clear

62
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,310
that this is actually a major factor in

63
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,090
preventing credit card fraud a lot of
credit card fraud

64
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,430
really occurs in other ways that don't
have anything to do with 22 Sep record

65
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,450
numbers on the wire

66
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,890
as people pay for things on

67
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,760
people may try to intercept record
numbers with key loggers he may try to

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,609
steal credit card numbers from the
e-commerce sites themselves

69
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,689
on the Metro yet another is so it's not
really obvious that this is a major

70
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,590
issue I'm certainly happy to their arm

71
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,488
but its far from the only thing but
maybe more important point is that could

72
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,060
occur numbers are not necessarily

73
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,070
anywhere near the most sensitive thing
you try to communicate on the web

74
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,699
so a lot of people give their credit
card number

75
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,419
and their credit card every day shoes
strangers

76
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,440
in stores and restaurants whom you can
take the credit card numbers into a back

77
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,960
room

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,299
and do something with them and then
bring them back our

79
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,270
I don't know if they would want to do
the same thing with their Google

80
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,940
searches

81
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,000
for their Wikipedia grossing I think for
many people that's a lot more sensitive

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,780
and so i think there's been a
recognition about

83
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,740
also people are very concerned about
protecting passwords and logins

84
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,759
and they're concerned about suffered
it's because they don't necessarily want

85
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,479
someone who controls the network

86
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,090
to be able to replace binary were

87
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,810
browser plugin and also people are

88
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,919
maybe finally starting to realize that
packs effing is really easy

89
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,359
actually want to make a video that shows
people how easy back to defuse

90
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,410
because I do think there are a lot of
people who don't

91
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,860
great perceived you may use wifi network
and not realize

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,259
that everyone from we're sure concealed
facts

93
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,460
arm I think this audience is not good
are going through that barrier

94
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,930
but I think there's a I think there's a
need for them but on our site operators

95
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,830
are nervous

96
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,159
and so they're starting to turn on issue
the ps4 non

97
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,870
financial transaction parts of their web
sites and I think that's a great

98
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,139
development

99
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,229
I'm here just a few recent examples

100
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:56,008
Google we're very grateful to them we're
asking for that for a long time

101
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:59,930
are very good for the data Facebook

102
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,060
on Twitter an identical

103
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,630
and thats for the ability to read tweets
as well as post tweets

104
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,350
so you don't have to be logged in to use
which i think is important

105
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,350
I love people miss you Twitter as
trivial but there are a lot of people

106
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,840
who use it for

107
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,610
things that begin a lot of trouble for
like political protest organizer

108
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,190
arm in places where they're not really
allowed to organize political protest

109
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,740
so it can actually be quite important
that people not know what tweets you

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,389
reading

111
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,530
and not know that you're the author
particular treats even though the

112
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,289
content of the tweets themselves is
public

113
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,710
others in anonymity aspect gmail

114
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,500
are Wikipedia this is really great and
in fact all of the Wikimedia Foundation

115
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,419
refuse

116
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,669
in every language on so which injured

117
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,930
with the news Wikipedia in every
language

118
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,960
on Amazon outside of the US I don't know
why they don't do it in the US

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,150
on would be nice notably for

120
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,169
browsing and shopping not just for
payment

121
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,698
so there's an issue I'll talk about this
a little later

122
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,860
you know not just with your credit card
number but what did you actually buy

123
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,139
and what did you actually look at and
browse through I'm

124
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,960
there's generally a lot of concern in
the physical world about privacy of

125
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,900
people's

126
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,190
reading habits an Amazon Services
bookstore

127
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,500
I and there's a concern and love I'm

128
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,030
law in the United States about
protecting people's confidential

129
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,090
arm purchasing and browsing history

130
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,060
as well as the box at the checkout
larger so it's nice to see a site like

131
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,800
Amazon make it possible

132
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,039
for you to you rosenfield shopping cart

133
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,560
in SUVs US Postal Service

134
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,620
Jim X which is very popular with no
provider in Germany and Europe

135
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,389
are several newspapers like the New York
Times and The Globe and Mail

136
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,629
on medical in genetic sites

137
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:01,360
like 23 NB blogging sites like WordPress

138
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,550
you know which is ur I'm trap and I am
interface

139
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,940
are so did your more than a hundred
other

140
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,979
sites that we know of for purposes other
than

141
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,110
credit cards ok that's great think it's
wonderful

142
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,060
development and relatively recent
development

143
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,400
sOooo issued UPS is also very fragile in
some ways

144
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,520
and I'm you talk about to have those
ways there may be others

145
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
arm one is in the tackle this is self
striping

146
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,240
and one is a problem about public key
infrastructure

147
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,839
and I'm going to talk a little bit about
what we can try to do about some these

148
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,010
things

149
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,718
so SSL serving as an attack that was
invented by mark Simmons bike

150
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,970
and it's a subtle point bud

151
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,290
it's a very powerful attack there are
some sites

152
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,540
try to require issue GPS because they
feel

153
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,550
the site operators feel that what goes
on on those sites

154
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,709
is very sensitive and should always be
private and confidential so you should

155
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,680
always be using HTTPS when you're on
that side

156
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,390
and the leading example if this in many
ways is paid now

157
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,160
so if you go to pay pal image GP they're
going to redirect you to be deleted it

158
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,949
should UPS

159
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,950
no matter what page on the site you went
you including the homepage

160
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,680
arm they don't want anyone to change any
if they reached him

161
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,290
they don't want anyone to choose any
other JavaScript they don't want any

162
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,719
content to appear anywhere on that side
but they didn't put their

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,850
I'm which kinda makes sense considering

164
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,170
thank you to the attacks against them

165
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,110
and service and your redirect so should
have become dot com you get this

166
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,810
redirect

167
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,890
well Moxey said: an attacker doesn't
have to let users see that redirect

168
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,080
the attacker can hide that redirect and
then proxy the entire session

169
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,000
the attackers and make a connection in
HTTPS and the attacker can make

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,420
unencrypted version I've the exact same
content

171
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,209
available to the user so the user
actually goes through the login process

172
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,610
and interacts with the site

173
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,779
that's not available United pretty
cheesy p

174
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,060
arm but the attacker makes it available

175
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,810
very powerful attack arm mark silly for
everything

176
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,290
is essential structural can replace the
sites feedback on

177
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,870
with the future have so losing someone
needs to experiment to see

178
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,880
what percentage of users get fooled by
this but please do it in a lab

179
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,990
and not your workplace for traffic

180
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,640
arm so it's very significant because

181
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,290
most users never typed in issued UPS

182
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,019
even if they're going to you aside that
supports it

183
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,540
even lots of users who knew what each
UPS use

184
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,300
and new why they should use it I'm

185
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,399
they don't necessarily have a bookmark
to the secure version of the site and so

186
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,079
they're potentially vulnerable to this
attack

187
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,779
on me never notice because they are
interacting with the real side

188
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,130
so there's proposal to address this is
so stupid

189
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,310
called strict Transport Security

190
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,660
and the basic idea is that a section say
this site uses GPS

191
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,740
only and the browser should only access
it in its UPS

192
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,940
regardless of what the user says
regardless of what links a

193
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,640
you should always look at the issue vs
region there's a bootstrapping

194
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,149
I can arm if the attacker doesn't let
the user communicate with the real side

195
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,700
the user may never learn about the
site's policy

196
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,230
I'm selects tricky

197
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,490
it appears that all major browsers are
going to implement this in the near

198
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,420
future

199
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,599
the first implementation that ships by
default in a browser

200
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,740
using Google prime and chromium

201
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,850
and that's great one of the difficulties
about this

202
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,709
is that sites have to wants to be it
should yes only

203
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,829
because if any browser that supports
this connects to you

204
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:03,800
the site in a GPS and learns about the
strip transport security policy

205
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,089
then at least from that grows his point
of view that site

206
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:13,510
is a GPS only and it will break if the
issue to PS version is unavailable

207
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,630
some sites as it turns out want to of
reach DPS but they don't necessarily

208
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,380
want to require

209
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,300
our forces one reason might be that
their site slowed a little bit slower

210
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,910
than it should be

211
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,639
yes because their additional ground
troops setup Trinity less brutal

212
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,639
relative to just setting up its GDP

213
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,130
I'm another consideration that's a bit
more insidious is that

214
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,760
they may fear that some networks would
block if they went issue

215
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,060
yes only I'm and there's a recent
precedent for that in terms of Google's

216
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,639
actions after they deployed even the
optional version

217
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,779
there include search

218
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,589
when who will deploy their injected
search they started receiving complaints

219
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,620
from schools

220
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,870
that were running sensor where that the
schools had to choose

221
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,950
between blocking a bunch of Google
services that the teachers were using

222
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,769
HTTPS

223
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:14,180
arm or letting students to searches that
would bypass the sensor

224
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,139
and the schools were gerrymandered that
they were confronted with the streets

225
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,740
because they wanted to be able to block
some stuff without blocking other stuff

226
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,180
and it was all in the same included host
they would be able to block it

227
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,079
arm so they complain to Google a lot and
you'll actually decided to move

228
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,100
they recruited search onto a different
host

229
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,290
soon it would be easier to block arm

230
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,639
so I think that's just one case the
covered that network operators

231
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,430
me pulled over sex decisions about
encryption

232
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,779
I'm by threatening or desiring to block

233
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,250
things in order to retain the ability

234
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,930
to observe users activities are

235
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,329
and that wasn't even making this a GPS
on

236
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:03,589
which would be a much bigger

237
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:07,240
so yes I found that were project are
collaborating on a thing called each

238
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,190
GPS everywhere %uh this is a Firefox
plugin

239
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,290
you can get a bureau here over 200,000
people have downloaded

240
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,139
and the basic idea is that we rewrite it
should leave you to it should be PS

241
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,269
on sites that we know will support it

242
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:28,410
arm interestingly in a couple of cases
that doesn't necessarily mean that the

243
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,769
site operator

244
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,420
particularly wanted you to access it
through HTTPS

245
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,260
but the permit you to you arm so we do
experiments with sites where we try

246
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,889
rewriting

247
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,500
various parts of the site in HTTPS and
we see if it breaks the cider

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,529
and it doesn't break the site will write
a rule

249
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:51,230
that does the transformation arm and so
I think there are cases where some sites

250
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,490
don't necessarily realize that their
pilgrimage

251
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,800
UPS but it's still a good thing for
their users I don't think we're doing

252
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,190
something bad to the site

253
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,310
by encouraging users to use them in
secure

254
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,690
so some people say well why don't you
just had an asteroid you just training

255
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,630
in essence if the connection succeeds

256
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,930
and the basic difficulty is that URL
patterns can be very unpredictable

257
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,550
and you can get portion other side
that's available in issue TPS in

258
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,000
abortion that's not

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,410
answer depends on particular path for
the particular URL

260
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,500
I if you want example if this could get
issued yes everywhere

261
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,050
and look at the rules for Wikimedia were
for Google

262
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,930
I'm just to start both have them send
you to a different host

263
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,019
if you're in issue DPS I'm

264
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,040
and then they may change the URL scheme

265
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,730
and then for Google their particular
Google services that will work

266
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,019
and particular users is that will work
initiative yes

267
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,810
so we have to actually know what those
are and regular expressions for them

268
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,040
and similar problems with somewhat less
complexity

269
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,610
her for a lot of other sites so we have
lots a regular expression rules it's

270
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,430
kind of a mess

271
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,060
on we have a big backlog user rules that
we need to merge

272
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,079
and we need to try to store them in a
hash table so that we can scale up to

273
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,149
more

274
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,019
rules and ultimately we think we need to
move to something like Adblock Plus

275
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:13,350
renew the subscription

276
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,750
I love user-contributed rules that make
sites work in the GPS

277
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,050
in a way it's kind of a mess I'm

278
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,709
but it actually does provide a lot more
privacy and security to users

279
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:31,529
serve that's nice even if it's a mess

280
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,680
now I wanna talk a bit about some of the
issues there were

281
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,389
reason that much easier talk yesterday
about certificate authorities

282
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:41,600
and certificate authorities rule arm

283
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,300
I actually just wrote an article about
this which is just appeared in

284
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,850
this month's are China rights form
published by human rights in China

285
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,680
so if you want to see on longer written
discussion of this

286
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,310
good human rights in China on take a
look at the generates for me to go

287
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,440
online

288
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,509
you can see my article about to just get
the 30s

289
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,490
is also called behind the padlock arm

290
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,799
so there's this concepts ohs who goes
triangle

291
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,379
xoxo says that you have to pick to have
these three properties for in naming

292
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,809
system

293
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,939
decentralized you meaningful and secure

294
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,929
that you generally kept at all 3 bomb

295
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,660
there's been a lot of discussion about
that in some people say it depends what

296
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,949
your assumptions are and so on

297
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:31,440
arm so we often use names that aren't
secure

298
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,580
in the sense that they're not
cryptographically secure and we can

299
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,620
protect us against a member middle
attack

300
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,660
on we often use names that are decent
reliance

301
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,299
in the sense that there's no party that
has to be trusted with the centralized

302
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,129
power to assign them

303
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,700
we often use names that argument
meaningful like

304
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,110
other people's first and last names I'm

305
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,390
apparently according to go we captured
all three at the same time

306
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,660
and so there's this choice about which
ones you want to give up

307
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,049
one idea is that we should give up human
meaningful and have the PGP Web of Trust

308
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,559
where people look at and talk about

309
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,918
views some hexadecimal strings

310
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,150
and they have to like to read them to
each other I'm

311
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,840
I visited a friend's hotel room here at
this conference I'm

312
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,209
two nights ago and I walked in and my
friend was

313
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,740
saying like Charlie Delta 34

314
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,299
0 alpha Bravo 7 3

315
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,110
I'm and I said yeah I walked in on
accident small party

316
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,230
on user find a fingerprint

317
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,140
and I'm was really proud like that's
really responsible thing to do

318
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm you can see that a lot of people
considered kind of a nuisance because

319
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,679
it's not really very human meaningful

320
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,640
stuff and you have to potentially read
the whole thing over the phone

321
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,830
I'm I mean there are interesting
alternatives like maybe

322
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,879
2d barcodes and you could have a 2d
barcode

323
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,850
mckeon if someone's can certainly have
it and they got it from you so they know

324
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,370
it's okay it's

325
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,660
arm but in some sense it's not you in
meaningful the way that your

326
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,549
first name is for the way that like
Google Talk homes

327
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:17,379
you could also choose to give up
decentralized and say

328
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,120
that there's a central entity or
entities that have the power

329
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,380
to you issue certificates

330
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,429
and that's the certificate authority
model and that's the model but netscape

331
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:28,660
chose

332
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,200
arm when they cooked up their
implementation SSL

333
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
and this idea actually historically
comes from a military chain of command

334
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,100
scenario

335
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,160
where there's this chain of command in
there someone who's in charge

336
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,010
and the issue responsibilities to people

337
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,080
and they also issued a graphic used to
people

338
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,149
along that same military hierarchy and
so there are some

339
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,640
concerns about this if you on

340
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,660
don't want to trust a single centralized
and there may be reasons that you might

341
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,539
not want to trusted

342
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,970
there might also be reasons that you
don't want to trust forty

343
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,120
or a hundred were two hundred such
entities

344
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I'm so there's this perennial concern
about

345
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,900
to certificate authorities there are a
lot of them

346
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't know how many if you have
recently looked in your browser at the

347
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,919
list researchers Giffords

348
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,330
but it's always an extremely alarming
experience if you really think about it

349
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,770
there's this question who are these
people creatures them

350
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,190
arm what happens if the certificate
authorities do something wrong

351
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,570
either because someone tricks them which
has happened

352
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,809
or because they didn't understand what
they're supposed to be doing

353
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,240
which has happened or because they have
a technical problem

354
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,890
up or because they get sold to another
entity or because someone just

355
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,530
ask them nicely to issue fix it if you
could and so on

356
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,440
soon how would we know if they did this

357
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,720
and with a suffer any consequences

358
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm also wire there's so many of them

359
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,760
because they're all equally trusted to
vouch for any side

360
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,020
it's not like there's Verisign that
consigned things for dot com

361
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,918
and the China Internet network
information center that can sign things

362
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,280
for .cn

363
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,418
and you can sign for each other that's
not the way it works they can all sign

364
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:20,929
for any damage

365
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,820
so also where they all could be trusted
to sign for any domain

366
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,918
I'm okay

367
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
so in practice there's been a lot of
scandals about this

368
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,909
arm one of the really impressive ones in
terms of

369
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,429
best use over PlayStation cluster on

370
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,890
was the md5 collisions paper where they
found

371
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,049
that a certificate thirty was still
using md5 which had been recommended

372
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:49,139
I'm by the cryptographic community to
stop using

373
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,289
for digital signature applications
because it was discovered that you can

374
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,250
actually create collisions

375
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,250
in the md5 hash function useful way to
the researchers took their PlayStation

376
00:21:59,250 --> 00:21:59,789
buster

377
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:03,158
and they're great for traffic school and
they said we're going to trick someone

378
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:05,059
into issuing a certificate

379
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:08,070
that does not mean what the video

380
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,830
use and they did and they got

381
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,539
I think many of you have probably this
paper but they got a certificate

382
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,679
authority

383
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,390
a mainstream trusted certificate thirty
to issue them a certificate that was

384
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,400
effectively

385
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,260
a full delegation evolve its authority
to them to do anything they wanted

386
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,150
now they're nice people so they made it
expired past but that was their choice

387
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,799
arm mark Zimmerman spoke also published
another

388
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,830
cool attack on the no prefix attack home

389
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,199
having to do with this perennial issue
about

390
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,580
string termination see you know this has
been hurting people for a long time

391
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,379
we just like never know where our
strengths and I'm

392
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,460
now even today we don't really know
where strings and where they don't

393
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,880
%ah partially browsers fault but it also
shows

394
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,049
that certificate authorities are willing
to sign pretty dodgy certificates if you

395
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,530
just give them money

396
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,190
like they're willing to sign
certificates that contain really weird

397
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,559
characters in really weird places

398
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,129
where that are kind of longer than they
appear to be crown

399
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,169
another weird scandal was that a
certificate authority

400
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,720
I just last year was issuing
certificates with

401
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,480
no checking so supposedly they're
supposed to check

402
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,120
that you own the domain that you're
buying a certificate for backs

403
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,940
the only thing that they're getting paid
for I'm

404
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,020
there was a certificate authority that
was

405
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,549
omitting that stuff and still collecting
money

406
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,940
and so I'm

407
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,299
ATM anger over rival certificate
authorities said well this is not

408
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,150
believe that good

409
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,890
and he went in just bought a certificate
for Missoula diverge

410
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,020
from the certificate authority he
doesn't want was ordered

411
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,010
he just said to taxes have a certificate
for Mozilla diverge you some money

412
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,299
and they said sure and u10 refuse to do
it was kinda scary

413
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:11,940
I'm there is also a paper from Chris ago
in and sits down

414
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,870
where the reported on a presentation
from a surveillance equipment vendor

415
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,929
call packet forensics

416
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:20,980
and in the presentation packet forensic
said

417
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,049
that they're cool appliance could do
automated men in middle attacks

418
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,779
and that you just had to load it with an
appropriate certificate

419
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:33,919
obtained in their words potentially by
court order

420
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,900
and seclusion and stamp set one you can
get a court order

421
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,809
for a certificate how does that work I'm
and then there was an enormous

422
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:44,559
controversy about the addition of the
China Internet network information

423
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,360
center

424
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,909
root CA to Firefox I'm which has gone
through

425
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:53,320
and it's in there it's in their roots EA
Store

426
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,720
I'm I actually think that the
controversy swirling missed the real

427
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,640
point

428
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,110
which is that olive view certificate
authorities are potentially suspect in

429
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,070
some way

430
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,129
and all of them have too much
unaccountable power

431
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,890
I'm people were particularly anxious
about the Chinese government and i can

432
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,409
understand the anxiety

433
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:15,460
but olive view certificate authorities
have this kind of power over you

434
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,070
and many of the other significant
authorities are also run

435
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,320
by other governments or government
affiliated organizations

436
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,889
arm my tentative count was that about

437
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:30,279
6 root certificates in Firefox were run
by governments

438
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,850
and about 24 in internet explorer

439
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,330
and that's I'm for years that's before
the addition

440
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,820
China Internet network information
center so I think it'd be kinda missed

441
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,889
that point but there are governments
that are in there already and there's a

442
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,299
question about

443
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:50,770
how do we know what the security
authorities are doing

444
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:56,299
I'm and so a lot of people and again in
case you talk this was articulated very

445
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,620
well

446
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,080
it seems that the city view thirties are
doing something very important

447
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,510
we do you actually want to know if we're
talking to the real site rather than

448
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,080
man in the middle rather than someone on
our wireless network rather I asked to

449
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,590
use

450
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,220
spying on over communications and
certificate authorities

451
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,169
to you give us information that could
help us make this decision

452
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,929
and that seems very important but it's
strange to think

453
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:25,919
that there's this listed entities that
everyone in the world

454
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,679
can trust and should trust for these
purposes

455
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,159
it's strange to think that there need to
be dozens

456
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,169
for hundreds of since every new
certificate authority is a potential

457
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:39,659
source of additional risk to users

458
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,340
home some interesting recalculation
about assuming that

459
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,450
v probability of misbehavior

460
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,870
from you certificate authorities
independent each other

461
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,500
arm and then choosing

462
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,360
probability value in choosing a number
of issues and you can make a little

463
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,220
graph

464
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,100
over the probability that no CA will
misbehave

465
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:08,049
I'm serve food it's kinda doubt

466
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:12,179
so one thing that we're doing over a DFF
is an SSL Observatory

467
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,909
which is starting with the survey evolve
the public certificates presented by

468
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:20,000
it should be a server's on the Internet
I'm

469
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,200
which we have done others in astor's you
can ask about the Astros

470
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,870
it's sort of all it's not actually I'm

471
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,140
it's actually hard to get all of them

472
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,100
for some interesting reasons what we
want to do is learn about how

473
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,159
certificate authorities are being used
and how they're behaving

474
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,110
and what they're signing and potentially
I retrospectively

475
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,539
discover if some of them are misbehaving

476
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,200
we can't necessarily prove that they're
not misbehaving that we may be able to

477
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,470
notice if the arms

478
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,799
I want to show you the really cool logo
for this

479
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,029
I'm which is going to be a woman
standing on a tower

480
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,100
holding a telescope and looking at the
night sky

481
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,990
and the night sky is going to be filled
with twinkling

482
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,630
yellow pad locks but our graphic
designers still working on it so I can

483
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,299
shoot you

484
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:11,779
but you can imagine let's go to love
padlocks and

485
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:14,820
telescope in the rig

486
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,960
outside it is being analyzed right now

487
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,159
my colleague Peter Eckersley is running
so much love

488
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,309
grease over the database looking at
interesting things

489
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:28,270
he's planning to have initial results
ready to present at DEFCON

490
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,789
I'm and there should be a lot of
interesting stuff even if we don't

491
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:32,179
directly find

492
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,299
an attack there should be some
interesting things and some surprising

493
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,110
things

494
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,659
just from looking at this data I'm we
hope in the long run

495
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,770
that will have a way that the public can
submit

496
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,320
certificate observations have their own
like I encountered the certificate

497
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,799
you should have it in your database one
reason for that

498
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,370
is that what you see on the internet
depends on where you are

499
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:02,370
I and that's true in many ways you might
see geolocation geo targeted advertising

500
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:07,340
it's also true in terms of certificates
which is kinda odd

501
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,370
but there these CBN's content delivery
networks and people have different

502
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,950
colocation facilities

503
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,279
in different places and will often send
you to the closest one

504
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,059
and different colours made actually have
different certificates

505
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:26,799
this is something that has really
antagonized me because it makes

506
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,570
some simple elegant solutions to these
concerns impossible

507
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,529
may be impossible I'm if different
colors have different certificates that

508
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:37,350
people in one place around whenever

509
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,720
me see a difference to to get than the
one that

510
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,230
other people see and that's why we could
really increase our coverage

511
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,409
by getting submissions from the public
on different networks rather than just

512
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:53,010
our particular scanning machine I'm also

513
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,559
if someone is doing an attack with a

514
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,559
Fig certificate concocted particularly
for that purpose

515
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,460
they would probably be well-advised to
do that attack against a very small

516
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,080
number of people

517
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,490
and for a very short time because the
certificates

518
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,309
are visible you could save them

519
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:17,200
and they provide evidence about what
happened in the sense that you can see

520
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,529
who signed

521
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:22,080
and what they signed and so if someone
did in the attack and they did the

522
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,129
attack for a long time against a lot of
people

523
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,080
I if any of those people

524
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,850
see if the certificate and looked at it

525
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,630
and compared to what other people are
saying they might realize that there was

526
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,539
an attack

527
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,049
and they may be able to deduce who was
responsible and so

528
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:43,210
getting wide coverage could be very
important in terms of

529
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,520
seeing attacks that are occurring in the
wild

530
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,610
so we hope to do that we also have to
allow the public to look at the data

531
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,720
that we gather

532
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,250
so if you run a side ideally you would
be able to go to the observatory

533
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,860
and look up all the certificates that
people have seen in the wild for your

534
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,809
site

535
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,350
which might be of some interest to you

536
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,519
a lot of people have also been talking
about trying to change browser security

537
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,919
policy

538
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,669
you were to try to address some other
concerns about the power

539
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:19,690
certificate authorities by adding other
information sources that people can use

540
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,799
so one of them that was presented here
hope yesterday's monkeys here again

541
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,090
this uses the PGP remove trust to make

542
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,380
assertions about the keys that website
should be using

543
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,649
and that's a really good idea it's
challenging because

544
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:39,000
a lot of people don't like being next to
a small stream through each other

545
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,110
I'm so we still have to figure out how
to you

546
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,159
may could would you be willing to trust
crew and make people

547
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:48,929
willing to participate in arm but
technically this is a really excellent

548
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:50,200
idea

549
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,580
because it provides a clear alternative
to having these

550
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,799
few entities with this unique power to
say things about cues

551
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,860
another proposal that a lot of people
have been excited about

552
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,049
is called perspectives where you get
information from a wide variety

553
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,399
ove surfers about what q's they're
currently seeing

554
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:15,330
and what q's they've seen recently for
particular site that you want to connect

555
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,370
you

556
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,370
and thus the project from Carnegie
Mellon and I use it and I think it's

557
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,980
really great

558
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,769
the difficulty is again that

559
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,399
sites can use different cues four
different

560
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,480
people so there might be

561
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,779
people in Russia who all see a
particular key for particular service

562
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:42,130
and the right people in the US who all
see it differently

563
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,600
and now they have to decide is the
russian government

564
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,059
attacking everyone in russia with the
man in the middle attack

565
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:53,168
is the US government attacking everyone
in the US with a min

566
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:58,110
attack or is the site just using two
different color facilities with two

567
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,019
different legitimate excuse

568
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,200
and there's no real way to make that
decision automatically

569
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,159
I'm because technically these situations
would be indistinguishable

570
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,559
the other concern is that a site can
actually use many different legitimate

571
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,820
queues at the same time

572
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,210
citibank's does this it's really
frustrating to go to the city backside

573
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,789
with perspectives and open up the
perspectives winner and see the history

574
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:21,850
graph

575
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,140
and you see this quilt because they have

576
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,299
dozens have Q's and the use all have
those Q's all the time

577
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,460
it seems that they have some
cryptographic appliances like

578
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,840
cryptographic load balancers and have a
different key in each one

579
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,110
and so the key that you get just depends
on random lock

580
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,000
and serve food you can't say oh that's
the same few that all the other people

581
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,039
are seen

582
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,029
because there's almost no chance that
all the other people will be seeing that

583
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,200
same key

584
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,600
but at the same I'm and

585
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,620
in the model as proposed by netscape and
as implemented by

586
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,919
all of the major browsers its okay

587
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,409
in some sense for Citibank to be doing
that I'm

588
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:11,960
there's new explicit rule anywhere that
you have to use the same

589
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,030
single key for site at a given time

590
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,149
we also had fun experience where I'm

591
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:25,259
we're running perspectives and we're
looking at some sites and I'm

592
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,000
you to the ppl site and there was this
key change

593
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,040
that lasted like four hours and then it
went back

594
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,070
to the original key I'm

595
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,970
and it was like we did why did the ppl
safety change for four hours

596
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,960
when hadn't changed for weeks and weeks
and then it didn't change for weeks and

597
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,449
weeks after that

598
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:49,658
I'm that someone like to BGP attack

599
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,790
and route almost there all those ppl to
somewhere else for four hours

600
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,040
so we got in touch with ppl and the pick
up people said

601
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,609
know that was okay on to worry about it

602
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:06,609
so yeah I mean

603
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:10,060
it's frustrating because you know we're
relying produced like

604
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,420
we want to worry about stuff arm

605
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,369
there's also a proposal to you use

606
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:21,390
individuals observed history like what
certificate authority have

607
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:25,250
I seen assayed using

608
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,109
others personal concert lock from
Scranton stamp

609
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:34,578
and there's also a DN a sec arm

610
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,770
so if you may be aware that the root
zone is finally signed

611
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,800
as a this week so you can actually
theoretically validate

612
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,810
things in the DNS cryptographically

613
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:50,400
I city in a sec is assigning system for
the domain name system

614
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,790
so you can actually get official
signatures over your DNS records

615
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,079
and through the first time this week

616
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,089
the root zone in sin arm

617
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:03,009
top-level domains that use are probably
actually not signed yet see probably

618
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,960
actually can't get your

619
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,010
your DNS records signed but you know
some people can

620
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,670
I had so there's a proposal that we can
use DNS sec

621
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,990
to publish search use and they can be
signed in the DNS which is cool because

622
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,079
it's another source

623
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,339
0 information and it's not the same as
the certificate authorities

624
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:26,349
I'm it still centralized

625
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,450
because the DNS authorities

626
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,270
instead of the certificate authorities
are in a position to sign things that

627
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,290
aren't true

628
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,509
to doesn't get rid of the centralization
you could say it's still progress

629
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,770
because now we have

630
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:42,759
another central authority that can work
in parallel to the existing central

631
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,829
authority

632
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:47,359
and if they disagree maybe we can look
into the matter

633
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,319
I'm doesn't get rid of the
centralization

634
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,420
I'll there's also a notion that there
should be

635
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:00,310
more standardization and how sites talk
about their security policies

636
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,660
there are a lot of mechanisms for this
on

637
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,140
so and east on Google and Jeff Hodges
from ppl have proposed that there should

638
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,890
be

639
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,920
a single place that browsers go

640
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,010
to learn about all these kinds of
policies

641
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,630
I think that would be a great
development and I think one of the other

642
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,930
things that mechanism could be used for

643
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,230
is for a site to talk about what q's

644
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:30,430
or what certs users of that site should
expect to see

645
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,629
for example a sacred say we

646
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:38,160
used this cryptographic key arm

647
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,549
but we're planning to change to this
other one in two weeks

648
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,079
so if you see s changed to this other
one in two weeks

649
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,200
that's okay I'm

650
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,150
you can actually do something similar in
monkeys here I A

651
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,170
but I think this would be a nice thing
because then you could say well if I

652
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,640
trusted the site then

653
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,660
if I thought at the if I

654
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,819
believe that my connection to the side
then was authentic

655
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,470
and I was talking to the real side and I
trust you decide to predict what did was

656
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,970
going to do

657
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,089
then I'm OK arm

658
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:17,240
you can also address the multiple
colours issue

659
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,359
potentially by having a mechanism for a
site to say

660
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:24,630
well issuer in Russia you can expect to
see this key

661
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,170
and that's okay if you're not in russia
you shouldn't see it

662
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,089
I'm or sacred try to promise to publish
revocation information

663
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:37,710
when there's a key change so that you
can expect to look for

664
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,530
that okay

665
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,990
this is all speculation because there
isn't actually a drafter proposal for

666
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,820
that mechanism but I think it's
interesting to think about sites

667
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,040
trying to you tell users more about what
to expect

668
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,349
in terms of cryptographic keys I think I
could potentially be a very powerful

669
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:59,020
mechanism

670
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,250
arm and so in monkeys here

671
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,589
and users can also save these kinds of
things like

672
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:10,599
that's totally agree cue for that site
I'm totally happy with it

673
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,930
I'm the pick up people our little bit
anxious about this

674
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,848
because they say well say operators are
the real authorities about what their

675
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,270
keys are

676
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,800
and they can change them at any time for
any reason

677
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,200
and you shouldn't necessarily expect
that some outside party

678
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,520
would know what the key ought to be

679
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,490
arm and so that's a challenge in
conceptual issue

680
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:40,470
so basically if you want actually have
private communications with the same

681
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:44,130
you decide operator to have a way to
reliably communicate to you

682
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,180
what publicly for the site should be I

683
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:52,089
lots of people want to interfere with
whatever kind of process we may have

684
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,150
to facilitate that process at the same
time a lot of people are trying to

685
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,070
improve it should be

686
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,829
yes and also to make it more widely used

687
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:05,819
I'm so if you run a site it would be
really cool if you turn on your GPS

688
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:10,369
you can also tell us about it we may be
able to put into each DPS everywhere

689
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,490
I'm you can run each DPS everywhere

690
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,589
and suddenly got a lot of your browsing
image DPS that you might not have

691
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:21,109
explicitly sought to you do securely

692
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:25,770
I'm you can try out some the plugins
that implement some of these ideas

693
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,119
us and bug reports try out my key sphere
chair

694
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,540
perspectives there's one called
certificate patrol that will warn you

695
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,740
when things change

696
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,849
kinda message style I'm

697
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,270
and that's about it so thanks a lot

698
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:49,270
and I'd be happy to have a new questions
that anyone

699
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,210
hi I was wondering if our

700
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,320
so sign to certificates if you could
speak a little about their expression

701
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,950
for people

702
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,950
who may be running home to informational
web sites

703
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:08,360
thank you yeah so sensitive to get so
this enormous controversy

704
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,840
because web browsers recently

705
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,660
have taken a lot of steps to you try to
discourage the use of sensitive its

706
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,129
so Firefox change their interface

707
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,550
in the last release of Firefox arm

708
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,660
someone described it as you get the
scary screen

709
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,339
and it asks you would you like to go on
to the other scary screen

710
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:38,240
or give up and then if you say you want
to go into the other scary screen

711
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,060
in its carrier so the relieve

712
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,850
you know don't like self-signed
certificates and

713
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,950
the core of this controversy in the
status quo

714
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,830
is not really about centralization

715
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,870
were decentralization but it's about

716
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:02,420
defending against passive use rubbers
versus active member middle attackers

717
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,750
I'm because if someone is just running

718
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,610
Wireshark van if you have a self-signed
certificate

719
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:15,540
you're still completely protected
against them if someone is running an

720
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,140
active man in the middle attack

721
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,170
then you need away a finding out if the
key is authentic

722
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,890
and in that case self-signed certificate
by itself without

723
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:28,710
having some other tool or some other
information arm

724
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,950
weatherman piece here were you remember
the hexadecimal word

725
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:36,770
you call someone up on the phone for you
have search patrol and US its style key

726
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,440
continuity

727
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,350
without some other two will you be
vulnerable to an active attack

728
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,730
so there's this trade-off actually
that's come up in a lot of crypto

729
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,790
between protecting against the passive
person who's just listening

730
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,200
and putting some infrastructure in

731
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,340
to protect against the activity occurs
changing packets

732
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,380
whose modifying communications I'm

733
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,530
one cool solution to this

734
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,540
has been off-the-record messaging

735
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,150
LTR arm which is a retrofit for

736
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:14,380
I am to add crypto to I am and what they
basically do you

737
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:20,590
is start out unverified start out with
the way to defend against

738
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,950
passive eavesdropper and then if you
want

739
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:28,670
you can do an additional verification
step to protect against the

740
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,120
active use proper I'm it seems like
that's

741
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,509
easy to do you because the protocol is
interactive

742
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,410
and because you can send messages back
and forth even in the middle of the

743
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,160
conversation

744
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,310
it seems like it would be harder to do
that on the web um

745
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:48,440
so you can just defeated the question
because I just said that

746
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,460
self-signed certificates are very
complicated arm

747
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,760
but are you disappointed that there is a
trade-off between the passive in the

748
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,080
active adversary protection

749
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,190
and browsers have been moving in the
direction up trying to protect us

750
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,720
against the active adversary

751
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,050
potentially at the expense I've passive
adversary protection

752
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:11,030
arm I'm not going to try to use a

753
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,160
whether that's good or bad but I agree
that it could be annoying

754
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,470
if you're trying to exist solely outside
of the CA system

755
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,540
and you have people are not

756
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,670
trying to just outside the system I

757
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,980
to I have a bunch of questions um

758
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,710
the first one the STS the problem with
this suggestion that if you have been to

759
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,950
the site for it cannot know that the
site should be

760
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:38,610
SBS only there is a list which I try to
start up using Chrome at the moment if

761
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,760
you type a powder comin to chrome bike
today it will not let you go to the HTP

762
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,240
site

763
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,720
ever even for a fresh install if you
want to be on that list if you wanna

764
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,220
site

765
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,370
please email me or just do a google
search for

766
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,290
chromium sts and you'll find a site with
details um

767
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:59,360
Citigroup the fact they run these tense
if it gets there not just being stupid

768
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,970
I believe that the senate's elevators do
not haven't option for exporting

769
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,870
trying to keep so they buy them they
come loaded with private key in every

770
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,890
never again should achieve that box
which is an interesting trade off

771
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:13,859
but I think that's what he do it I am a
CBS

772
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,990
for your site is probably slightly
slower I hope by this time next year

773
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:22,470
that's the latency hits would have been
eliminated

774
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,570
in chrome I can't speak for other
browsers but with chrome you should be

775
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,900
able to do a zero bound trip

776
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,920
SSL connection by this time next year

777
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,530
up and for the the cells on stiffing
apart

778
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,570
certificates are now free I star SSL dot
com we'll give you a certificate for

779
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,260
free

780
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,640
so there is little that it's very small
barrier these days getting feels figure

781
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,540
and frankly the value of your users to
go through this Gary page is probably

782
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,259
higher

783
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,950
things on I am

784
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,540
a GL above ground level ako dork and if
you have

785
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,740
any security firms you any big sites we
want to help you

786
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,850
be can only leave affect chrome we might
affect five Oaks a bit maybe offer

787
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,549
but we want to make out uses more secure
see if you have any issues

788
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,680
please email me we are responsive

789
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,290
up so I'm really grateful for all your
work on issue DPS

790
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,710
and I'm really excited about it and I'm

791
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,020
thank you for everything that you do to
make this UPS better

792
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,330
and all those points are exactly correct
and very useful and I'm sorry that I

793
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,720
didn't mention that before

794
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,720
but thank you %ah

795
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:38,700
what is your opinion I love EV certs and
would there be any benefit to

796
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,450
making browsers require sites likes it
is paid calvert

797
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:45,640
are was a love that has EV you see users
in the past

798
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,390
always use them arm

799
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,859
my a colleague Chris Palmer give a talk
about menu the same issues

800
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,710
where he said is very um cynical and we
beefing about

801
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,310
the the surge issue so I don't think I
can be as cynical

802
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:09,310
whereas with the as Chris Palmer so I
refer you to his presentation for that

803
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:16,240
I'm but just imagine something cynical
and body

804
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,650
who imager comment about up a pound and
a question for you

805
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,300
I'm just about Patel's how policies
enough anyone familiar with this but if

806
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,210
you are merchant

807
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,730
their I'm signing up policies very
liberal just take you

808
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm and then their compliance policies
very strict

809
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,130
so if you're an adult merchant doing
anything questionable you can process

810
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,330
like ten thousand dollars in the
shutdown

811
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,549
thank you for money so that's how
they've been very successful

812
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:44,260
on but anyway of a pic of I'm about so
sensors

813
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,630
do you have you seen or time understand
or know of any interest in the community

814
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,220
for us to actually create our own

815
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,250
certificate in this way now should be
responsible for ourselves

816
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,420
the same way like monkeys here but for
SSL well lucky she actually does work

817
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,440
with us

818
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,660
so I think probably what you're looking
for all tingly there would

819
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:07,359
be money user did I'm a very interesting
mixture but I mean in the sense

820
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,500
love a a community-run I'm spruce
certificate

821
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,100
authority in the same way that that
exists out there but is from my house

822
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,750
and on some

823
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,130
corporation arm I'm not really but

824
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,620
I'm not sure that's that would address

825
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:27,420
the particular concerns that I have I
think email address some concerns

826
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,720
but are

827
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,360
I don't think that the particular thing
that makes me concerned about the

828
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,940
certificate authorities

829
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,650
is that their for-profit businesses or
even impersonal corporations

830
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,390
I'm potentially this certifying role is
something that could be done

831
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,150
well by an impersonal for-profit
business I'm to the extent that it can

832
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,020
be done well by anyone

833
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,370
arm I think it's an interesting idea and
I wouldn

834
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,290
really oppose it but I don't think that
it would address the concerns that I

835
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,630
have

836
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,660
arm Arizona com is sorted usable

837
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,759
over HTTPS until recently searches

838
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,530
were were working but now the just
redirect to

839
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,770
me p2p but if you know the a scion

840
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,460
you go to product page but you don't
know the S an issue and on the searcher

841
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,390
unless you like heaven runs from another
where'd you get it from another source

842
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,490
yeah um I guess I'm thinking

843
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,030
I I definitely agree that there're lots
of parts have the Amazon said even the

844
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,990
Amazon US site that are usable energy
DPS

845
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,370
gonna give you the card yes

846
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:39,200
yeah I mean a check amazon has done a
lot of good it's your support on the US

847
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,530
side

848
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:44,020
to you I'm just thinking basically about
the browsing experience when you first

849
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,920
show up at the site if you start to
browse things

850
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,910
arm for your initial search if you don't
know the ASA man and you don't have

851
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,710
things in your cart and so on

852
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,740
year in in the mood current iteration of
the site

853
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,210
arm I mean I tried reading the rule

854
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:04,280
to do you all Amazon euros in a GPS unit
should get everywhere

855
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,540
arm and in the current iteration the
side it does bring side

856
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,320
I'm so but I'm optimistic certainly
because Amazon's

857
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,720
non-u_s_ sites all that you do
everything it should yes

858
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,680
so I hope that will become available
again for the US in

859
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,919
I'm thanks F this some

860
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,470
I work in a month for projecting spanky
for mention it folks

861
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:30,710
I wanna %uh just makeup observations
about

862
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,800
said just two observations self-signed
certificates

863
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,040
I'm actually are the equivalent BOE your
SSH host keys

864
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,529
so if you're comfortable connecting to
%s ish servers and just

865
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,470
either verifying or not verifying
fingerprint and then relying on the key

866
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,640
continuity

867
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,430
then accepting so sensitive it is the
exact same thing but with website

868
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:53,589
if you have sir um if you have certain
federal

869
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:57,620
good know if you accept the certificate
incest or this exception for me

870
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,880
that action is the same thing as saying
yesterday ok message prompt

871
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,050
arm youngest the warning

872
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,930
the freezing of the warning is a little
different the pressure was on how the

873
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,410
user interface is a totally different

874
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,879
okay during the day that if you if you
choose to do that that is

875
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,540
is fundamentally equivalent I mean just
does not sufficient for folks who are

876
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,350
currently using SSH one-way

877
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,370
and web browsers the other way if you're
if you feel uneasy about one or the

878
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,299
other

879
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,420
think about how to reconcile those
feelings cuz that's the same thing

880
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,230
I'm and then the second observation is
that about the scary page

881
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:34,070
that you get when you see an unknown
certificate I'm

882
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,450
when we work around that is to get a
quote real sir right from wannabes

883
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,350
unaccountable

884
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,970
certificate if there is but another way
around if you're doing an SSL stripping

885
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,510
style attack I haven't seen anybody
actually implement this but if you're

886
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,990
interested you should do it

887
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:49,460
I'm if you can do the SSL strip thing

888
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,050
then you can actually feed a mime type:
that is

889
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,820
a certificate authority certificate that
will prompt the browser to import data

890
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,150
into their root certificate

891
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:01,270
store so you can not just

892
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:04,630
not just replace the city with your sis
certificate but if you can convince the

893
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,450
user

894
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:08,980
to actually import your own certificate
authority you can %uh man in the middle

895
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,980
all other communications by doing that
one day so and that actually that

896
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,380
workflow is much simpler

897
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,830
then the difficult workflow for looking
and sell some certificates so

898
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,069
a there's a is an issue with the
browser's choices have you I

899
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:25,000
their dunno maybe another great you I
experiment to see

900
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,160
what percentage of users without a new
root certificate

901
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,750
if a site first give them a story about
why they should

902
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,090
and then known ask them to you

903
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:39,600
I would be interesting I agree it is
remarkably easy to add a new root

904
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,370
certificate

905
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:46,040
you touched on dr. government's
influence on certificate authorities

906
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,300
and that probably be a whole like talk
unto itself

907
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,510
but what do you see for the a potential
implications on trying to secure HTTPS

908
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,050
as a result of that special like the
intelligence community obviously has a

909
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,500
home a strong desire to be applied

910
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,000
be a man in the middle by sign their own
certificates

911
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,440
I'm sowee when you see that morning well
i think thats basically

912
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,880
one of the points on my knee mister
reasons that people are nervous

913
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,950
I'm group yeah %uh

914
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,290
so I guess I just said that I'm

915
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,310
nervous I

916
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:27,900
I met it's basically

917
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,950
here are some reasons why people are
worried about

918
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:35,020
the unaccountable power certificate
authorities and one of them used to

919
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,240
governments all around the world are
probably applying various kinds of

920
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,170
pressure and influence on some embassy
to divert is

921
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,800
I'm that's not the only reason that
people would be

922
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,350
anxious about whether this to be the
thirties are doing the right thing but

923
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,569
it's one reason

924
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,080
just one run several om

925
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,080
I'm lazy and I'm miss the first have
your

926
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,090
presentation so sleeping but

927
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:01,780
may be touched on this already but can
you come at you the previous guy come

928
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,440
cuddle that they can you comment on
politics with CA inclusion in various

929
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,460
browsers

930
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,020
and how that a little works how you
expected to work in the future

931
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,670
arm you could take a look at the thread
about the proposal to add the China

932
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,780
Internet network information center

933
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:21,500
CNNIC in Missouri and it would give you

934
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,740
microcosm those politics I guess

935
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,680
had expected to go in the future what is
your

936
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,430
what do you think I will someone unknown
first row just called out

937
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,370
worse such a person sounds like a good
answer

938
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:40,529
I mean it's I'm it's quite difficult
because

939
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:44,260
browsers have a lot of very complicated
incentives about this

940
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,890
because for example new browser really
wants to be the only major browser

941
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,410
that left out a particular root CA

942
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,819
because then there would be sites that
I'm

943
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,370
don't work in that browser but work in
other browsers

944
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,420
and in fact one of my big concerns about

945
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,110
attempts to fix many of these issues is
that

946
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:11,830
if a I'm safe doesn't work because the
browser successfully protected the user

947
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,230
against an attack

948
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,410
very likely user behavior in response is
to say

949
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,720
I hit this browser to give me this
crazier

950
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,270
I'm gonna open Internet Explorer and
it's going to work fine

951
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:30,730
FAQs sure so thank you very much

952
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:30,980
%ah
