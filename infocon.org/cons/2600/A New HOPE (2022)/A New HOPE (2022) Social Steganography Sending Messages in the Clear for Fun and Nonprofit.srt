[Applause]

animated gifs so uh and it's also done

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,879
completely in libreoffice and the

52
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,480
combination of these two things keeps

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
making my computer want to crash so we

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,519
might have some pauses

55
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,599
um but hi i'm greg uh i don't have a

56
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,720
hacker name

57
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,640
uh it's a long story that we'll get into

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,319
and wonderful it's freezing

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,440
yep

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,120
this is gonna throw off everything so

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
before we begin

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
like this started basically on the

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
underground comedy circuit uh back when

64
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,519
everybody got their vaccines and

65
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,879
everything and you're able to go back

66
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
out into public i saw a sign on a pole

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
that said there was an open mic and so i

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
just kind of wandered in and started

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,959
talking

70
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,599
uh and uh people didn't always like what

71
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,640
i said

72
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
um and so this talk is what i call about

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,840
what i call the idea that propaganda is

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,599
the selective telling of truths we have

75
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,400
a society nowadays where people think

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,799
they can just lie all the time and then

77
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
it's this kind of idea i'm going to

78
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
challenge you

79
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
to prove me wrong just be exhaustive

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720
and people forget that we live in this

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,799
society where truth is an absolute

82
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,280
defense against libel so if you know

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
things that are true about somebody uh

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
you can just be like well you know gdpr

85
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,360
is a european law and uh i haven't been

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
irb certified in a while so let's do

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
this um but in all seriousness in this

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,040
talk there's going to be sex

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,400
is it going to freeze up every time i

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,040
try and move a slide

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
there's going to be some talk about drug

92
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
use

93
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
come on this is going to throw off the

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
entire thing

95
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,959
it was not like this yesterday

96
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,720
might be some discussions of violence

97
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,239
come on you can do it

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
oh we can't even see it

99
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,040
i'm connected

is this the correct cable

101
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,719
it's not the hdmi port is it

102
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
this is the chord right yeah and then

103
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,400
unfortunately not too many options up

104
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
there

105
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,579

143
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,199
people who make a big deal about like oh

no i'm not allowed to uh trigger people

145
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
that's that's not nice

146
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
and it's not how you make friends it's

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,599
how you end up at deathcon as like a 50

148
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
year old guy who has no friends

149
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,479
um because yeah in all seriousness i

150
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,560
extremism really worries me i was a

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
really reactionary 18 19 20 21 year old

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
people maybe knew me by the handle greg

153
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
norris g-r-e-g-n-o-r-c on the game fax

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
forums i was unsupervised anyways

155
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
trigger warning we may discuss in this

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,360
talk some sex

157
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,039
might discuss drugs

158
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,120
there might be some violence

159
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
and this was when it started to freeze

160
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
that's why i was freaking out a little

161
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,039
there might be some logan act violations

162
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
or discussion of them apparently it's

163
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,840
one of these things it's like one of

164
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,039
these laws that's on the books that they

165
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
never enforce it's like you're not

166
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
allowed to sit in a basement in

167
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,960
appalachia and do your own foreign

168
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,199
policy it's like well

169
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
you weren't supposed to hack my laptop

170
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,800
anyways about the speaker three things

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,919
my legal name is gregory

172
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,160
my hacker name

173
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,879
greg that's me on a boat in seattle

174
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,360
i told them on a boat in seattle you

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
stop having elections we're going to do

176
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,039
whatever we want with the computer

177
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,760
it's a social contract

178
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,159
i'm a censorship circumvention expert i

179
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,360
put out a talk at the hot pets which is

180
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,519
an academic workshop they have this

181
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,958
thing if you're doing a phd they have

182
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,640
this idea as what is peer-reviewed

183
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
versus not so if you do what's called a

184
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
workshop it's kind of like submitting to

185
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
hope or defcon or whatever you have

186
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
peers

187
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,440
they review you

188
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
you go to a foreign country and eat a

189
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,760
bunch of tapas and talk about it but it

190
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,600
wasn't peer-reviewed and then if you try

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
and take it further into the actual

192
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,959
peer-reviewed venue then they have this

193
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,880
attitude of like i've seen this before

194
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
one's like well what am i supposed to do

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
i gotta preview my methodology and all

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
that

197
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,000
uh

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,880
so

199
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,720
yeah i did a master's thesis it was

200
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,440
called why johnny can't blow the whistle

201
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
and we made that title before snowden

202
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,600
made privacy cool

203
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
uh before that i was an altar server at

204
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
our lady of grace

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
our lady of grace closed the boy scouts

206
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,519
closed this is what happens when you

207
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,959
insist on a very weird neo-liberal view

208
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,279
version of economics everybody leaves

209
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
pet pittsburgh that's where i'm from i

210
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,320
haven't been out of pennsylvania for god

211
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
oh no well i haven't been out of the

212
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
country since the since before trump

213
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,560
took office

214
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,399
um

215
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
and i'm a former staffer i was the staff

216
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,320
technologist at the center for democracy

217
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
and technology i was the guy who got

218
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
everybody onto two factor i was the guy

219
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,279
who was teaching them how to spot

220
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,279
phishing messages and i was the guy who

221
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,240
was told in about september of 2016.

222
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,760
ah you may have backed the wrong people

223
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
in the primary we're kind of done with

224
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,839
you and then of course you know the

225
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,399
election happened by that point i put

226
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,160
all my [ __ ] into a ryder truck and moved

227
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,760
back to appalachia and just had this

228
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,440
attitude of like well you know you think

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,240
you know more than me have fun

230
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
so at that point what i did was i took

231
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,920
my twitter handle and i changed it to

232
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
don't be nebby and i went out to las

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
vegas for defcon yet again i've been

234
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,000
going since defcon 17.

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
uh the first one was a little bit

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,079
awkward i had an expungement that was

237
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,880
arranged by a motorcycle gang i did not

238
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
know it was arranged by a motorcycle

239
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
gang i thought it was arranged by a

240
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
therapist at my catholic college who

241
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
connected me with a lawyer people don't

242
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
just roll up on me and tell me these

243
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
things but it explained why some people

244
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,959
who i thought were absolutely

245
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
reprehensible would tell me that they

246
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
liked my research because they want to

247
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,079
be rude on the internet it's not why i

248
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
like tor um so anyways we have three

249
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,120
easy rules for influencing in cyberpunk

250
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
america uh the art of creative cyber

251
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
nonfiction i was thinking about going

252
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,839
back to pitt and doing an mfa in

253
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,519
creative nonfiction that was what i was

254
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,440
originally going to do and i was like

255
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,800
well

256
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
be an artist there's not a lot of money

257
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,920
in that turns out there's not a lot of

258
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
money in being a phd dropout either um

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
but the three things oh wait

260
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,839
for

261
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
uh are to be ambiguous

262
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
uh

263
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
to tell selective truths

264
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
um consent matters and we're gonna get

265
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
into this this isn't like a sex thing

266
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,079
it's more about two-party consent

267
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,360
recording laws and things like that

268
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
because these interplay because if you

269
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,519
know when you can record someone then

270
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
you can take their words and play them

271
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
back and make them own their evil and

272
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,360
then of course truth is an absolute

273
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
defense against libel

274
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,959
um i really don't like when people go

275
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,240
around and think that they can just tell

276
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
whatever lies they want and then you've

277
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
got to prove that it was a lie but

278
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
conversely it is extremely extremely

279
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,279
powerful if you're just willing to go

280
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,440
you know what i'm sick of these people i

281
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,959
won't call them pedophiles but people

282
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,800
who met me as a child who feel that they

283
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
can shape my career path shape my

284
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
political choices shape my bodily

285
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,639
decisions

286
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,680
uh

287
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
and well anyways

288
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,800
yeah so for example when we talk about

289
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
being ambiguous

290
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
why do i have a screenshot of an article

291
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,360
about nixium with uh some highlighting

292
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
about richard branson on the left and

293
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
then a thank you for coming to my ted

294
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,720
talk on the right with an image of ted

295
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
kaczynski

296
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
who knows that's my right as an american

297
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
again be ambiguous own that on social

298
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,279
media you are not required to explain

299
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,040
what the [ __ ] you mean

300
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,560
there are these people they want to be

301
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,959
offended on purpose they want to go

302
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,880
find your social media and find

303
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,639
something to be offended by and they

304
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,440
want to ask clarifying questions in bad

305
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,120
faith so they can point you at paint

306
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,440
using being aggressive mentally ill this

307
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
that or the other

308
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
um meanwhile i don't know if people know

309
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,279
this back in appalachia we had people

310
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,720
who were going straight up onto the

311
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,639
radio saying things like oh i think you

312
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,480
should straight up shoot somebody if

313
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
they mess with a statue of like columbus

314
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,600
or whatever

315
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,880
but if i make one little joke on twitter

316
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,399
done

317
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,399
so yeah be ambiguous

318
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,279
uh

319
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,040
you know uh

320
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480
like i'm talking now does this kind of

321
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
like oh you know i'm like this cool guy

322
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
i like stand here just

323
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
you know make them uncomfortable

324
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,399
but also be specific

325
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,480
be specific show up in their mentions

326
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
uh so i found this uh the new york daily

327
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,240
news put this out jose and matt giselle

328
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,519
i had this whole thing i would always

329
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,959
try and learn how to say the

330
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
international student's name i thought

331
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,920
it was really disrespectful they'd have

332
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,519
somebody come over from china or india

333
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
or whatever and then they're learning

334
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,639
english and they would just straight up

335
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,920

347
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,880
to delete the entire post like that kind

348
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,839
of energy

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
yeah i'd never been to philadelphia even

350
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120

nobody threw batteries at me it's not as

352
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
bad as you'd think

353
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,560
so yeah to give like the actual oh sorry

354
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,199
what slide is this

355
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,240
okay yeah the origin story so i would go

356
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,519
out to defcon 17. i was working at cmu

357
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,480
in some random lab uh and i didn't even

358
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
get pto so it's like i very rarely would

359
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
take it i was doing a ton of overtime

360
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,639
uh i was like can i take off for def con

361
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,839
they're basically like you want to not

362
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,040
be paid sure uh go ahead uh and i went

363
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
out there i had a little little

364
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
expungement uh and uh i wasn't really

365
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,399
supposed to be drinking and they

366
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,680
basically told me you know what we

367
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
really don't want you to do is like

368
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
drink 40 beers and fight somebody but we

369
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
want you to be professional network all

370
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
that good stuff

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
um but at the time if you were a defcon

372
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,560
newbie in order to get your hacker name

373
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
and all that you had to go up on stage

374
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,000
and do a shot of alcohol now number one

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
some people are like alcoholics or

376
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
muslims or whatever they just don't want

377
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,639
to drink alcohol and it shouldn't be a

378
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,399
combined thing then i come back at

379
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,720
defcon 18 it's like well i could do a

380
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,120
shot if i wanted to and you know like

381
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920

383
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,320
whatever

384
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,600
came up and screamed in my face like

385
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,079
you're not a newbie and so by that point

386
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,279
it's like well

387
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,800

391
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,560
uh

392
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
but uh

393
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,599

394
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360

course and now it's freezing okay so

397
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,839
yeah around this time you know you've

398
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
got julian assange coming out with the

399
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
wikileaks uh

400
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
at the time we didn't know that he was

401
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
just a real jerk but he's also a real

402
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,920
jerk that we shouldn't invent crazy

403
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,120
loopholes in the law they're gonna be

404
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,639
used against people who aren't as big as

405
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,920
jerks that's all i'm gonna say on that

406
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,959
guy

407
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,199
uh so yeah what the [ __ ] greg you know

408
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
what the [ __ ] kind of thing uh also a

409
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,360
lot of americans references i did not

410
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,839
watch the americans until like

411
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,600
2018 but

412
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,120
some of these feds really like to quote

413
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,000
that thing yeah

414
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,160
so what the [ __ ] what we're talking

415
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
about is three things cults crypto and

416
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,759
cognitive psychology

417
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,560
uh what i did back in 2016

418
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
is i completely delete my facebook

419
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,079
because i was talking about maybe doing

420
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,199
something with a clearance and they tell

421
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,040
me well if you want to do a security

422
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,000
clearance you're gonna have to fill out

423
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
what's called an sf86 and everybody

424
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,360
who's on that facebook friends list is

425
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
gonna be listed as a foreign contact

426
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,399
well wait a second i built my career on

427
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
being a censorship circumvention expert

428
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,320
some of these people don't necessarily

429
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
want to broadcast that they know me to

430
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,880
put it mildly some of them are from

431
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,320
countries like

432
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,480
say iran or

433
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,359
hopefully not north korea um and so it

434
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,039
was a thing where

435
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
i come back to appalachia trump has been

436
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,079
elected i delete the facebook and then

437
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,919
what i did is i started going down to

438
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
the township library teaching myself how

439
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
to hack again really abusing that wi-fi

440
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,640
and using the interlibrary loans to get

441
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,280
like 20 different books on ted bundy uh

442
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,679
ted bundy's big secret by the way uh he

443
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,120
did a bunch of volunteer work for the

444
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
republicans uh he got somebody to write

445
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,799
him a letter to go to law school and

446
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,240
then he went to a shit-tier law school

447
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,919
in like utah or something and then had a

448
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,679
mental breakdown that uh

449
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,039
even at shittier law schools you have to

450
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,120
do work you just won't ever work off the

451
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,039
debts

452
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,840
so yeah be

453
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,879
ambiguous selective truths

454
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,200
um so

455
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,360
the idea here and i'm articulating

456
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,320
poorly is what i call a sin flood s-i-n

457
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,080
basically you're just throwing facts at

458
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,320
people rapid rapid rapid rapid rapid and

459
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
it's just like it's not going to be

460
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,559
to give context because i'm realizing

461
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
not everybody spent their time binging

462
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,080
the americans and trying to pass the

463
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,679
oscp

464
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
this character is talking to her kgb

465
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,120
handler who is like a full-on stalinist

466
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
and apparently i forget what the plot

467
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,160
line was they put her kids in danger or

468
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
something she's like i'm going to murder

469
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
the kgb or something

470
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,000
um

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,919
that one's a bit too much

472
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,440
or conversely you can flip it around and

473
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,799
be specific you avoid references you

474
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,440
speak simply you use logic or and not

475
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,360
and rapidly escalate if they

476
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
misunderstand on purpose so here we've

477
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
got a scene from the americans

478
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,760
uh the character on the bottom uh he's

479
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
not in like the little you know phone

480
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,280
room communications room or whatever and

481
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,799
he's trying to ask something of one of

482
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,520
the com communications people so the guy

483
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
opens his door he says is president

484
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,520
reagan personally

485
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
scaling our walls in his cowboy hat no

486
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
never knock on my radio room door again

487
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,360
that's what i'm talking about when i say

488
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,720
be specific if you want to be a good

489
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
propagandist i sent out this meme at one

490
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
point when i had my twitter

491
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
i had the city of pittsburgh police come

492
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,960
and bang on my door and claim that

493
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,280
vanguard had done a wellness check on me

494
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,480
at the time i thought it was because i

495
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
sold shares of shares out of a vanguard

496
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
account but it may have been a reference

497
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,400
to some neo-nazi group i don't know i

498
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,640
don't care

499
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,679
uh or

500
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,679
you know um another example of this i

501
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,840
was the author of

502
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,760
oh there should be an e there but i was

503
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,120
working on this quite late uh

504
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
pedagogy of the depress this was an

505
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
article i wrote about being a special

506
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,039
education student in the 90s

507
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,760
um boing boing was going to bring those

508
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,559
comments back import them in and decided

509
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
not to because

510
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,760
it's my understanding they're just

511
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,240
embarrassed about what went down uh they

512
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
didn't pay me for the article they put

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,080
it out at like 6am without giving me a

514
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,559
final say-so on it uh and then some of

515
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,039
my old teachers showed up in the comment

516
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,440
section to basically question whether i

517
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,159
should well you can't see the scar here

518
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
um or somebody was telling me earlier

519
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
they were telling me about somebody who

520
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
i won't name them because i don't want

521
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,480
to violate their privacy but apparently

522
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,159
before they died during covet they were

523
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,559
doing a bunch of cocaine

524
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,960
uh anyways

525
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,520
case study time consent matters

526
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,559
uh

527
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,360
so

528
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,440
i got a lot of phone calls

529
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
during covid uh people have this

530
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
attitude in pennsylvania of it's a

531
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
two-party consent state

532
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,080
so i can say whatever the [ __ ] i want on

533
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,600
the phone and then you can call the

534
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,039
police and maybe they'll do something

535
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,720
about it kind of thing

536
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
um it's a very manipulative thing to do

537
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,520
you should not be changing

538
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
what you say based on whether somebody

539
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
could record you

540
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,159
you shouldn't be engaging in this weird

541
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,679
gaslighting behavior um and the thing is

542
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
um you can flip that around because let

543
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
remember

544
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,840
felons can't own guns to put this in the

545
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,760
context a lot of this starts like this

546
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,600
energy bubbled up during the

547
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
insurrection but they've been going for

548
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,200
a while so we've got these people who

549
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
just kind of act

550
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,280
insane and then um they're so they do so

551
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,559
many things that could get them locked

552
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,080
up and i don't understand why we

553
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
tolerate it

554
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
uh so back when i worked in dc i told

555
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
them on the way out i was like you

556
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,640
should be more worried about free

557
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,080
expression you should be more worried

558
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,280
about people using their first amendment

559
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
rights you're obsessed with this ideally

560
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
i might not write you a letter of

561
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
recommendation i might say that you

562
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,080
should never work in public policy again

563
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,120
it's like well

564
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
you know what if you continue on this

565
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,159
path they are going to come with guns

566
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,679
into the capital and try and just take

567
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,039
over congress

568
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,240
and that's actually what they did

569
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
um so yeah in all seriousness if you are

570
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,559
in pennsylvania california connecticut

571
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,480
florida hawaii illinois you've got this

572
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
two-party consent thing going on but

573
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
it's kind of useless people are you know

574
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
doing ss7 and all this good stuff

575
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,120
um consent matters ss7 is a thing we had

576
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,679
a thing back in pittsburgh um

577
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,679
the health department and two one one

578
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,520
learned that inner calls were

579
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,600
intercepted at a carrier level so we had

580
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,039
this thing going on where some poor

581
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,200
bastards trying to get like food stamps

582
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,120
or whatever and then some phone scammer

583
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
jacks the call

584
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,400
apparently what they were doing is

585
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,760
they'd actually get them the food stamps

586
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
or whatever allegedly and then also take

587
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,039
the information but sometimes they'd

588
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,320
straight up just take their information

589
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,559
and hang up on them

590
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,240
these calls never made it to two one one

591
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
like this is a thing imagine that you

592
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
are like sitting in a coffee shop and a

593
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
literal [ __ ] nazi comes up and

594
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
harasses you you start walking down the

595
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,960
street you try and call 9-1-1 and then

596
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,440
the call goes to like some random person

597
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,120
on your street like somebody sitting in

598
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
like a lawn chair on the corner rather

599
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,280
than going to 9-1-1 dispatch that was

600
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,640
the life i was living during covid

601
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,760
and yeah i don't know i guess i should

602
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
call the fbi or something i don't seem

603
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,159
to give a [ __ ] about anything except

604
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,559
running up on the capitol um so again

605
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,840
this is where we start getting into the

606
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,600
good stuff getting into the good stuff

607
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
uh

608
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
so you know here's an example of this

609
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
propaganda is a selective telling of

610
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,080
truth this idea of throwing people

611
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,679
putting them on tilt

612
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,200
oh because i forgot that i had also told

613
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
people like welcome to the cyberpunk

614
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,520
helpscape learn poker like learn a trade

615
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
because you know there's not gonna be

616
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,559
computers for a while

617
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,280
um so this is a real thing i walk into a

618
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,120
graveyard i'm telling somebody anything

619
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,919
like i'm sick of these nazis um and then

620
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,799
they're just like we're going to make

621
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,640
this woman senior advisor to the

622
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,440
norwegian military

623
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,039
i've got an expunged from knife crime

624
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,880
for a lawyer i found via therapist i

625
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
didn't it was in some kind of motorcycle

626
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,679
club and

627
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,360
after that i started my phd where i

628
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
focused on designing usable anonymity

629
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,520
tools for dissidents in oppressive

630
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,000
places like the middle east and

631
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,640
midtown manhattan occupy wall street by

632
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
the way they are unionizing the

633
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
starbucks in bloomfield little italy and

634
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,400
pittsburgh so

635
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
hell yeah one of my first girlfriends

636
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,400
was a starbucks barista they need to

637
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,570
treat them better

638
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,760
[Music]

639
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
here's another good one

640
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,039
i told the head of some weird obscure

641
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,799
lab they need to stop busting drug

642
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,799
dealers and go after the pedophiles then

643
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
some dumb feds got their heads blown off

644
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,880
shortly after in florida did people see

645
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
this the sunrise shooting biggest loss

646
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
of fbi

647
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,679
uh since 9 11 apparently um they were

648
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,559
going and rating some absolute

649
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,240
bad person

650
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
and this was like two months after i had

651
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
this convert i was absolutely [ __ ]

652
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
livid i literally walked my ass down to

653
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,320
a university and just like why why why

654
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,400
do you care about like some guy who's

655
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
selling shrooms on the internet when

656
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,760
these [ __ ] people because i don't

657
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,520
know if people know this tor used to be

658
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,679
really slow it was really [ __ ]

659
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,880
useless when i started doing this

660
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
usability research they've added a lot

661
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,360
of capacity i didn't really play around

662
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
on the dark web very much i was more

663
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
interested in is like an open source

664
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,559
intelligence tool a censorship

665
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,080
circumvention tool

666
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
and when i was attempting oscp i went

667
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
out onto the dark web and some people

668
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,840
are real [ __ ] and deserve to die

669
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
so yeah uh this is from hard candy by

670
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
the way uh this is uh

671
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,200
what's her face she's pointing the gun

672
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
at the guy telling him you know hang

673
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,720
yourself that's the end of the movie

674
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,679
consent matters i'm not a lawyer

675
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,440
so let's talk about the state for a

676
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
minute this is this on the left is a

677
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,559
meme i made i didn't make the one on the

678
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,559
right

679
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,080
uh so this is greek

680
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,400
uh render under caesar um because i meet

681
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,520
a lot of these people they think that

682
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,600
taxation is theft and it's like well

683
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,480
okay

684
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,919
i think you can move to syria and live

685
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,120
in the autonomous zone or whatever

686
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
this is something i found i was at the

687
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,960
hospital visiting my dad at one point

688
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,559
and then i pulled up that they've got

689
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,120
this uh these bible verses i think this

690
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
is actually a really interesting concept

691
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
this idea render under caesar render

692
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,000
under god like this idea you have to

693
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
have something even if you're doing this

694
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,279
burning man crap we're all going to give

695
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,279
each other beads well you know you've

696
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,480
got to give some of the beads to like

697
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,039
the guy who runs a camp or whatever

698
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,360
um

699
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
basically means there's no such thing as

700
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,640
free money from the government not truly

701
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,720
now we can set things up that if you're

702
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
having hard times we've got like a

703
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,480
social safety net

704
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,320
but it also means

705
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,159
purchase private security

706
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,039
um i was at a protest at one point i do

707
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,559
not go to protests i have designed

708
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
technologies to enable them but if i am

709
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,159
at a protest it is because i think

710
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,440
they're literally going to start

711
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,559
shooting

712
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,919
it means this is on like donkey kong we

713
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,320
need things to change and that's what

714
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,720
ended up happening they had a literal

715
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,400
riot outside the former mayor of

716
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,240
pittsburgh's house well not a for

717
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,159
literal riot they went had a peaceful

718
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,600
protest they started tear gassing the

719
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,360
[ __ ] out of them uh one of the people

720
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,799
who got tear gassed apparently now is

721
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,159
like the mayor's secretary or something

722
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,559
so that's [ __ ] hilarious uh and we've

723
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,320
got a new mayor of pittsburgh now he's

724
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,080
black because people kept telling me you

725
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,960
know

726
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
you aren't like involved in your

727
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
community maybe you should do some

728
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
volunteer work for the democrats you're

729
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
too far to the left it's like whatever

730
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,799
and again truth is an absolute defense

731
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,360
against libel uh the uk style is you

732
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,960
gotta prove you're correct and that's

733
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
difficult

734
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,360
uh there was a whole case about this

735
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
this mcleible thing look it up

736
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
um because again i really cannot

737
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,440
emphasize enough i

738
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,039
got i've got

739
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,000
wounds

740
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
like literal wounds

741
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,360
because some of the crap that's gone

742
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
down because of the things i've said on

743
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,880
the internet not things like everybody

744
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,200
should get in an oven but things

745
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,799
positive

746
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,600
and i'm i'm really really sad that i do

747
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
not have the traffic and analytics data

748
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,880
that i would have liked to show during

749
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,799
this presentation because apparently if

750
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,559
you get knocked off twitter

751
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
uh you do your take out the one thing

752
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
you don't get is that view data how many

753
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,919
people um because

754
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,600
i can't articulate this well because i

755
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,039
have the data anymore but there would be

756
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,880
situations where maybe you only get like

757
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,399
three four five hearts maybe one retweet

758
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
but you're getting like five hundred

759
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,640
thousand views it's like they saw that

760
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,559
like the the jane maxwell one where it's

761
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,480
like i think you meant socialite a lot

762
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,600
of people saw that tweet

763
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,720
and then the other thing is we have this

764
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,080
post-columbine threat model somebody's

765
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
gonna interact with me when i don't want

766
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
them greg

767
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,679
is gonna come and he's gonna dm me or

768
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,120
he's gonna show up at my house or

769
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,360
something and this is our entire model

770
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,039
it's like we're gonna make sure

771
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,960
uh that you do not interact with

772
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,120
somebody without their permission

773
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,799
uh and that's how we've structured all

774
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
of this neoliberal society so flip it

775
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,120
around repeat after me this is your new

776
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,559
mantra karen i'm not your caregiver and

777
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,279
i'd prefer not to interact

778
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,679
you need to take this language that

779
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,760
these weird alt-right people have

780
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,240
developed and flip it back on them if

781
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,919
you run into somebody from say your old

782
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,520
catholic church who feels entitled to

783
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,840
comment on how you're living your life

784
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,279
just say to them

785
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,720
why do you feel the need to come and

786
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
touch me just because you met me as a

787
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,760
child what is it by the way with people

788
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
who who went to catholic churches in the

789
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,120
suburban pittsburgh that they'll just

790
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,480
walk up and start rubbing your head and

791
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,240
stuff it's like it's weird don't do that

792
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,880
um but one thing i am really interested

793
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
in is i hear all these people they talk

794
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,919
about the idea of states rights or

795
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,880
whatever um so how does that intersect

796
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,679
with a computer because you know as you

797
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,520
most people know when you send packets

798
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,960
they're crossing state lines most of the

799
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,399
time

800
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,559
um so maybe we can apply this model more

801
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,600
if you're hosting a server in

802
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
pennsylvania that's when things get

803
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,399
interesting and this is when the talk

804
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,399
goes from being more of a 4chan brand to

805
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,440
actually being substantive um so no

806
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,880
conviction shall be had in any

807
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,399
prosecution for the publication of

808
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,159
papers relating to the official conduct

809
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,480
of officers or men in public capacity or

810
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,880
to any matter proper for public invest

811
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
investigation or information so to give

812
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,080
you a specific example distributed

813
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,760
denial of secrets one of the things that

814
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
they published was a list of uh people

815
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,559
in i think it was oaf keefers or a few

816
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,600
other

817
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
right-wing groups

818
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,799
and then our pittsburgh city paper did

819
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,399
an article about how some of them were

820
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
police officers or employees of the city

821
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,919
and things like that

822
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
um i think it's really interesting to

823
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,039
sort of flip this state's rights thing

824
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,279
around and go like oh you know what yeah

825
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,720
i'm four states rights let's put the

826
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
[ __ ] onion server in pennsylvania and

827
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,720
blow your [ __ ] up

828
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
um here's another good one you know how

829
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,159
we were talking about two-party consent

830
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,039
um there's a part of the pa code they

831
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,480
say exceptions to

832
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
prohibition of interception disclosure

833
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
of communications any victim or witness

834
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
um to

835
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,600
a

836
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,640
a crime of violence that may even just

837
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
may occur now you can start recording

838
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,480
calls so imagine that you've got

839
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
somebody who phoned you up and they say

840
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,840
for example uh i don't want you going to

841
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
protests and

842
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,240
if you go to a protest i'm going to come

843
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,720
and run you over with my car

844
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,399
and then you get really angry and you

845
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,320
report them to the fbi or whatever and

846
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,559
the the it all boils down to basically

847
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,799
he said versus she said kind of thing

848
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,399
so then imagine you start recording this

849
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,159
person's calls and then they're going to

850
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,840
be like oh well you're in pennsylvania

851
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
so i want to hit you with a felony for

852
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,000
recording me threatening you

853
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,279
there is a long long long list of

854
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,600
offenses in pennsylvania that may make

855
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,200
you able to suddenly record those phone

856
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
calls

857
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,279
eco-terrorism that's interesting uh

858
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,559
i'm not even gonna list all these off

859
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,960
but there are so many exceptions and the

860
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
thing is i have had conversations with

861
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
these milk toast democrats for over 10

862
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
years they are obsessed with this idea

863
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
that they can say whatever they want on

864
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,519
the telephone it's protected by this

865
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,360
legal mechanism

866
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,960
and then they have like this offline

867
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,559
thing that they can do i don't know if

868
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,159
any of you ever worked for like an ngo

869
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,240
or a law firm but you'll see people like

870
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,679
picking up the phone and talking to each

871
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,200
other as they're emailing they have like

872
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,519
this back channel it's the most annoying

873
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,960
crap

874
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,760
and then here's another good one

875
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,159
uh intent to deprive thereof a person

876
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,240
commits an offense if they unlawfully

877
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,880
access or exceed their authorization

878
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,120
uh with the intent to deprive

879
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,480
so you know for example let's say you're

880
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,760
somebody from internet archive and

881
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,039
you're willing to pull a bunch of [ __ ]

882
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,080
down

883
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
maybe find find a library in in

884
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,080
pennsylvania to do it because as i'm

885
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,240
reading this i'm not a lawyer

886
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
uh but as i'm reading again i really

887
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,799
can't emphasize enough i'm not a lawyer

888
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,240
uh but it sounds to me like they're

889
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,200
saying if you're just doing something

890
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,279
like scraping that this is giving you

891
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,640
some pretty good

892
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,559
uh legal basis for it not being a

893
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,039
computer crime

894
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,720
and again we've also gotten the state

895
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,159
constitution that we're allowed to you

896
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,360
know do these things about public

897
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,840
officials

898
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,519
and then uh they have this thing here i

899
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,600
need to find out about this um attorney

900
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
general shall have concurrent

901
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,159
prosecution jurisdiction

902
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,120
um

903
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,720
i'm not clear if that means that the

904
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,840
attorney general can also prosecute

905
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,559
um or if it means they can override uh

906
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,200
the more local county district attorney

907
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,000
um but to be clear because i'm realizing

908
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,320
i flew through a lot of this

909
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,640
a lot more quickly um

910
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
than i intended

911
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,760
to put it all together

912
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
uh what i'm trying to get at is this

913
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
idea is we've got a state constitution

914
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,159
in pennsylvania that seems to

915
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,480
protect the right to scrape information

916
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
from the internet

917
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,039
it seems to say that if you're

918
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,320
interacting with a computer system

919
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,640
sorry

920
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,760
when i tested this it was not

921
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
we've got a situation where if you at

922
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,519
least if you're in pennsylvania

923
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,120
according to this state state

924
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,440
constitution and some of the combining

925
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,360
that with because again we're going to

926
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,200
read our state constitution and that

927
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,279
should be informing the laws back and

928
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,559
forth

929
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,000
so it looks to me like they're saying if

930
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,279
you're not depriving somebody if you're

931
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,600
not knocking a server offline

932
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
uh

933
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
it even seems to me because look at this

934
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,679
it unlawfully accesses or exceeds

935
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,120
authorization

936
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
with intent to deprive

937
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,480
so does that mean that if i

938
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,239
am you know doing some web application

939
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,679
testing fuzzing

940
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,599
doing a little nmap scanning things like

941
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,280
that a lot of the things that we've

942
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
really argued about at the federal level

943
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,199
about this this idea of what is like

944
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,040
good security research

945
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,480
it sounds like it's written in plain

946
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,239
english in the pa code that if you're

947
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,760
not depriving somebody if you're not

948
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,359
crashing their system if you're figuring

949
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,839
out a bug or something

950
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,799
you're good

951
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,040
and

952
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,719
you know i'm sorry i rambled a bit but

953
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,118
again

954
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,119
this was

955
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,879
really kind of

956
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,239
i wasn't even sure if i should do this

957
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,520
talk but uh i am frankly

958
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,320
just completely

959
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,839
completely tired of this model of

960
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,280
policy civil society whatever

961
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,320
where we need to hide basic things like

962
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,079
uh i'm queer

963
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,920
i'm just speaking for myself i'm queer

964
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,720
i'm autistic i'm a trauma survivor i

965
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,480
have bounced from precarious position to

966
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,720
precarious position for over 10 years

967
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,640
trying to put things together so that

968
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,920
things like distributed denial of

969
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,800
secrets can occur the wikileaks stuff

970
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,079
they were doing the swiss bank stuff a

971
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,480
while back uh that was good that guy

972
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,839
went off the rails

973
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,599
um

974
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,839
what i'm gonna

975
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,280
do um

976
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,599
is

977
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,599
i think what i'll do is i'll open up is

978
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,680
anybody have questions because this is

979
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,919
yeah sure

980
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,079
oh yeah i'm sorry i wasn't able to get

981
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,760
into this as much because again i lost

982
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,800
my twitter i don't have a lot of these

983
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
things but the idea is that you're when

984
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,680
you're doing like let's say you're

985
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,160
sending an email you're speaking in the

986
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,280
clear

987
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,040
like people seem to like the forward

988
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,359
emails around and also just on on the on

989
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,800
the protocol level it's a clear text

990
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,920
protocol

991
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,680
and then you have this this thing with

992
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,920
ss7 i don't think i i articulated this

993
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,440
well

994
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,960
it used to be i i saw uh

995
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
the packet i'm

996
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
purposely avoiding the first name

997
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
because i can't remember what their new

998
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,240
one is i don't want to name somebody um

999
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
the but they did this talk about

1000
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,680
intercepting cell phone communications a

1001
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
long time ago and it used to be that the

1002
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,760
equipment was really expensive

1003
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,880
um

1004
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,000
and

1005
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,839
now it's moved to this model where

1006
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,079
anybody who has about five grand can set

1007
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,720
up an mv what's called an mvno like a

1008
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,480
mobile reseller

1009
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,040
um so basically and then you combine

1010
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
that with some of the stuff i read about

1011
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,400
you if you read some of the stuff on the

1012
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,240
intercept and a few other places when

1013
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,960
they broke into belgium they took some

1014
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
of the data they took if you read about

1015
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
how 4g encryption is done there's this

1016
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
one like like cryptographic primitive or

1017
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,440
whatever that that like if you have like

1018
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
it's encrypted but if you have like

1019
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
there's like one primitive that's like

1020
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,760
from the manufacturer another from

1021
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,720
something else and combining them

1022
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
together that basically they stole the

1023
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,680
thing that when you combine them

1024
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,880
together like you could decrypt

1025
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,320
communications basically just like if

1026
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
you had like a wpa

1027
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,880
psk network if you get that key to kind

1028
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,280
of oversimplify um so basically people

1029
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,599
have this mental model of if i'm walking

1030
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,200
around if i'm using like 4g or whatever

1031
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,240
like you know it might be a little more

1032
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,000
secure to like make a telephone call i

1033
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,440
would run into people in washington dc

1034
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
it'd be like very taunt like oh i don't

1035
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
have a smartphone

1036
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
i've just got like this 2g nokia

1037
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,240
attitude

1038
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,599
um so that's what i'm talking about when

1039
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,640
i'm talking about speaking in the clear

1040
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,280
is the idea is sometimes you will very

1041
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
purposefully i will give you a specific

1042
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
example

1043
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,440
i felt like i was being stalked

1044
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,280
so i sent a text message to somebody

1045
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,880
saying meet me

1046
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,960
coffee shop a

1047
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,400
you know you're going to pick me up

1048
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,839
we're going to go someplace gave

1049
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,680
ourselves a nice little date

1050
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,560
then

1051
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
i text them on signal

1052
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
actually change my mind

1053
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
we're going to coffee shop b

1054
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,240
and that one i had to get on a bus to go

1055
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,960
to

1056
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
so then it's like i walk out of my

1057
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,200
apartment i go in front of where i was

1058
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,040
supposed to meet somebody i've got

1059
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
weirdo mcstalker sitting outside and on

1060
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,640
a long enough timeline i notice things

1061
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,000
like this

1062
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and then you immediately get onto a bus

1063
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,760
and go just like two streets over and

1064
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,560
get off at the other place now what has

1065
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,480
to happen is if it's not like an

1066
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,240
intelligence service if it's just like

1067
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
weird ass like q and on type people

1068
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,800
they're not that organized so then this

1069
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
person has to get up from where they

1070
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,640
were previously and come to you so the

1071
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
idea is sort of um that there are these

1072
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,599
people that they abuse their access that

1073
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,480
um

1074
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
it's my perception that what people are

1075
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
doing is like you saw the thing with

1076
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,880
twitter right where people were abusing

1077
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,800
access to dms or whatever i think when

1078
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
you see something like that at one

1079
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,560
company it's happening at all of them

1080
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,920
and i think that you're also having

1081
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,280
things like i was just discussing with

1082
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,960
the belgicon thing that basically often

1083
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,320
people can like i don't think that just

1084
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,599
happened at belgium i think that's

1085
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,079
happened with a lot of mobile carriers

1086
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,079
and so one thing you could do is you

1087
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,160
could throw a vpn on your phone but then

1088
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,520
you're funneling all the traffic through

1089
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,800
a vpn we had a criminal case i read

1090
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,280
about in back in appalachia there was a

1091
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
guy who was uploading csam to the dark

1092
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,440
web and apparently he got he was using a

1093
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,720
vpn when he did this um if you read if

1094
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,359
you're using tor over a vpn like you're

1095
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,520
collapsing everything oh sorry you're

1096
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,920
collapsing everything together tor is

1097
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,240
circuit based if you open up tor and

1098
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,560
then i go to like cnn.com and i go to al

1099
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,720
jazeera i'm like doing my you know daily

1100
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,320
like read the news from seven different

1101
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
perspectives everybody does this right

1102
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,560
you read russia today you re read npr

1103
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,839
and then you read al jazeera to make

1104
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,680
sure you understand the world

1105
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,160
yeah um so

1106
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,839
uh

1107
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,480
yeah like is this making sense this idea

1108
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,440
of

1109
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,400
um

1110
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,000
number one

1111
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,599
um that when you are speaking in the

1112
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,520
clear how to really communicate

1113
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,599
effectively and again a lot of this got

1114
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,440
dropped i was going to talk a lot about

1115
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,760
some techniques that i developed uh to

1116
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,560
sort of what if like your actual phone

1117
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
is being examined by like border guards

1118
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
something like that sort of like

1119
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,760
preparing for like a trip moscow to

1120
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,640
china

1121
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,960
um i decide not to talk about those

1122
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
techniques that's why this talk is all

1123
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
over the place i decided not to publicly

1124
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,880
discuss a lot of that because what ended

1125
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,760
up happening is i went down to cmu and i

1126
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,680
told somebody you know i just got laid

1127
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,560
off

1128
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,119
sick of these epstein people uh i want

1129
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,200
to go to vietnam because they have

1130
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,880
e-visa so they check if you're some kind

1131
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,119
of epstein guy before you arrive

1132
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,880
uh and then i want to maybe do like a

1133
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,640
moscow beijing train or something like i

1134
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,560
want to be like a travel writer

1135
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,160
um

1136
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,760
and i then i told them you know please

1137
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
you know start busting these pedophiles

1138
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,359
instead of the drug dealers

1139
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,720
um and then i started

1140
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,680
just i don't know i got a medical

1141
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,800
marijuana card and just started

1142
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,720
listening to a lot of techno it's not

1143
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,400
been a good covet for me

1144
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,359
any other questions

1145
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,720
was at least a good talk

1146
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,010
okay

1147
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:28,070
[Applause]

1148
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
if there are no other questions i'm

1149
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,720
probably just gonna like wrap up a

1150
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,240
little early rather than eat up people's

1151
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,760
time but i really appreciate people

1152
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
bringing me out uh if anybody wants to

1153
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,119
talk afterwards more serious

1154
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,359
conversation i'd love to talk about

1155
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,200
censorship circumvention talk about

1156
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,520
