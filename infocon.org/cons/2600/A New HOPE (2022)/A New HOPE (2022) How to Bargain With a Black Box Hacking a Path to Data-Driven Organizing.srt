1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,680
i just

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:29,980
[Music]

3
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,040
[Music]

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
welcome back how's the sunday coming

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
along all right

6
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,520
all right

7
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,760
all right this is it you uh you didn't

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
quite make it but you almost made it

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
through the endurance test which is a

10
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,360
new hope there's so much to do so much

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,520
to see fantastic program thanks to all

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
the speakers um

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,119
this before we get to this next talk

14
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,080
i'll make a couple of brief

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
announcements first is that uh closing

16
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,880
ceremonies is at six we're going to be

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,280
simulcasting that to room 206. so if

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
this room gets a little full 206 is a

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,119
place to go rather than a little theater

20
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,560
that just makes logistics a little bit

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
easier for everybody

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
also uh with closing ceremonies

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
which is a fun event we just sort of

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,240
thank everyone summarize how things went

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
uh afterwards we have a band they're

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
going to start out there they're going

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
to march down to the outside area and

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,240
you're welcome to hang out enjoy some

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
salsa music after the closing ceremony

30
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,320
is done and after that or maybe even

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,000
during that we do need a lot of help

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
with packing up a lot of relatively

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,199
heavy labor but unskilled labor so

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,720
you're welcome and encouraged to stick

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
around if you have time after closing

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
ceremonies help out with the packing up

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
that also includes packing up some

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
outbound rental trucks tomorrow morning

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
starting at around nine in the loading

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
dock and d'angelo so we do put out a

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
call for volunteers you'll hear this a

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,560
few other times during the during the

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
day don't forget to stay hydrated it's

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,000
still a hot day hot sticky day out it's

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
pretty nice air conditioned

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
inside and i don't need to remind you as

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
much anymore to be excellent to one

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
another because we have all been

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
excellent to one another haven't we and

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
that's been yeah thank you and that's

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
been really excellent so and we'll talk

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
about that more in closing ceremonies so

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
if you're thinking oh i got a bus to

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
catch i got a plane to catch i got to

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
wash my hair

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
this afternoon maybe stick around

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,760
because it's going to be fun as we get

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
towards the end of our three-day event

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,239
here so up next is dan kalachi and we're

60
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,000
going to hear all about how to bargain

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,599
with a black box please welcome dan

62
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,000
thanks hi um

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
i'm dan i'm a phd student at mit

64
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
um and today i really want to talk to

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,680
you about why i think the future of the

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,599
labor movement needs

67
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,239
hackers so i'm going to talk about

68
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,120
one project that i've worked on with a

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
group of platform workers worker

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,239
organizers

71
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
who sort of led a uh basically a project

72
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,879
to audit an algorithmic page change in a

73
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,799
delivery platform and then a bunch of

74
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,040
other little pieces of things that are

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
moving around in the labor movement

76
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,959
related to building technology making

77
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
technology accessible and increasing

78
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,440
digital literacy for workers around the

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
globe um i'm going to try and convince

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,760
you that

81
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
working on this stuff if you have the

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,400
technical skills is worthwhile and

83
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
needed

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
so this is sort of the thesis the

85
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
argument here the future of the labor

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
movement needs hackers i'm going to

87
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,280
quickly just um

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
acknowledge the

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,799
colleagues of mine that work on these

90
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,120
projects with me johnny

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
uh christina kochliff and nathan freitas

92
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,680
um we all sort of work on different

93
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
related labor and technology pieces uh

94
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
together in tandem and volunteer in

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
other capacities

96
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,199
if you're interested in this stuff i

97
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,600
highly recommend you go

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
check out their twitter profiles

99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
websites etc

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,759
so on to the

101
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
convincing so to start i'm going to give

102
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,240
you a motivating example of why building

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
technology for the labor movement is

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,040
crucial now and will be increasingly

105
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,199
crucial in the future

106
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,560
so um

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,320
in the summer of 2020

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
shifts which is target's delivery

109
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,479
platform it's like instacart but just

110
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,600
for target

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
they changed their payment algorithm for

112
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
workers they went from a

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,199
really clear pay scheme to basically a

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,120
black box algorithm they used to pay

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
seven and a half percent of an order

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,479
total so if you paid a hundred bucks for

117
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,479
a bunch of items from target your

118
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
delivery worker would get seven dollars

119
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,240
and fifty cents plus a five dollar base

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
fee this was good for workers because

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
they could see exactly what they were

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,759
going to make for a given job their

123
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
contract workers they get uncertain jobs

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
they get delivered them by an

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,639
algorithmic system

126
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,320
one that nudges them pushes them in

127
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
different directions controls them in

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,639
some capacities

129
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,280
and this is a piece of clarity in an

130
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,000
otherwise very murky system for these

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
workers

132
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
but in the spring of 2020 ship decided

133
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,720
to move to a black box algorithm

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
this algorithm as it started to roll out

135
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
to different workers who

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,479
randomly essentially got the new version

137
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,639
of the software on their phones

138
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
found that their pay was dipping

139
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
um workers started protesting they

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,639
started sharing their stories online so

141
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,039
online facebook groups and organizing

142
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,639
forums were full of people just sharing

143
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,880
screenshots of pay that uh you know

144
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
here's an order from three months ago

145
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
where i made 50

146
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,919
but here's you know a really similar

147
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,919
order today where i made 30. this is a

148
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
big pay cut for a lot of workers and

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
these workers are low wage folks doing a

150
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,440
lot of very critical work and this was

151
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
in the middle of the pandemic if you

152
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,080
remember

153
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
the whole narrative around essential

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
workers around people delivering these

155
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
goods to folks who are staying at home

156
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,080
trying to stay safe and healthy

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
this

158
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
was a huge affront

159
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
so

160
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
um the original pay structure

161
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:37,919
uh

162
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
like i said was seven and a half percent

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
of that order total was five dollars and

164
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,639
this new algorithm people started

165
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080
basically

166
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
going online and speculating about what

167
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,880
it was doing how is affecting people

168
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
you would get a change and you would

169
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,919
think it would work one way you would

170
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,680
speculate oh maybe they're trying to

171
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
give me an hourly wage based on my

172
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
distance or miles and you get a new shop

173
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
and it would completely you know change

174
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,039
your hypothesis

175
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,520
so i want to introduce you next to

176
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
willie this is willy solis willie

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
sillies is a worker organizer he's a

178
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,199
good worker

179
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
and during that spring and summer of

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,160
2020 willie started seeing these posts

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,000
on forums online on facebook groups um

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
and

183
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
he started collecting these screenshots

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
the ones i mentioned before that show

185
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
worker pay

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,759
and

187
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
he started asking people to send them to

188
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
him and they started

189
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,720
pouring in so these screenshots are

190
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
screenshots of people's record of their

191
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
pay for specific shops over time so they

192
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
include you know how much

193
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
someone paid for their order includes

194
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,599
the tip amount includes the amount of

195
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,360
time that it took to deliver the order

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,599
it includes the date it happened all

197
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,400
this information and so the plan was

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
or i guess willie had this idea that

199
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
he could collect these screenshots and

200
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
look at how people's pay changed over

201
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,280
time

202
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
but once he started getting the

203
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,680
screenshots

204
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,000
it became really overwhelming he would

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
take them and put them into a

206
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
spreadsheet and also once he got it into

207
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,440
the spreadsheet he didn't really know

208
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
what to do he's not trained using data

209
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
he doesn't know how to build tools oh

210
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
i'm sorry i'm i think i'm screwing up my

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,759
slides

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,039
um

213
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,319
he didn't know how to build tools to uh

214
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,800
to look through this information in ways

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
that

216
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
could really help him and other workers

217
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
make sense of what was going on

218
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
um

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
and that's when i got connected with

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,919
willie

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,360
i got connected to billy through an

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
advocacy organization called coworker

223
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
you can look them up they're great if

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
you have any interest in organizing your

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
workplace they're a good place to start

226
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
for resources

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
this is 2020 so we're meeting virtually

228
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
over zoom willie with his phone in his

229
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
car and me with my computer in my office

230
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,560
and

231
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,279
we

232
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,640
talked for

233
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
a couple weeks and basically as soon as

234
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
i saw this

235
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,080
this system of those screenshots plus

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,959
this

237
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,480
back end i knew that we could do

238
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,839
something way more effective than

239
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,760
someone manually coding a bunch of

240
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
screenshots into a spreadsheet

241
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,240
so what we did

242
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
was we made a texting bot

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,839
this texting bot would take screenshots

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,120
from workers

245
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
and would parse out people's pay all the

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
details that i mentioned before from the

247
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,120
screenshot and at the first pass upload

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,560
it to a google sheet

249
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
we would do a google sheet because it

250
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
would allow organizers like willy to

251
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
look at workers data and be able to sort

252
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
of track the process as we got

253
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
submissions in

254
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
and i want to sort of make note as i go

255
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,839
along of these different really common

256
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
tools that are useful for these projects

257
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
because there's a lot of organizers who

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
want to be able to use technology to

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
expand their organizing efforts collect

260
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
data like this but using like a database

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
for an organizer who's untrained is an

262
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,680
impossible ask it's people are not

263
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
you know trained as computer scientists

264
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,640
or as data scientists in

265
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
when you're driving

266
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
delivery work or you're doing low wage

267
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
like contract labor it just doesn't

268
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
exist

269
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
even within large organizations like

270
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,640
groups that you know do worker advocacy

271
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
that digital literacy and maturity

272
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
isn't really there at the moment it's

273
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
not there yet

274
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,079
and this is a big asymmetry between the

275
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,120
workers

276
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
who need information to start proving

277
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
things about their work and employers

278
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,079
who are increasingly using data to

279
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,640
manage workers and make important

280
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,160
workplace decisions for them

281
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,519
so we started collecting these

282
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
screenshots using this tool we developed

283
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
it over a couple of months um there's an

284
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
academic paper we have a little a

285
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,279
documentary video that details the

286
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,800
process uh it's like a very co-designed

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
uh piece of work because this was

288
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
something that willy started workers

289
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,480
started they started asking the

290
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,320
questions they created the method really

291
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
all i did as a technologist was

292
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,240
walk in and make it go faster and at

293
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
scale but the process was the same the

294
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
goals were the same

295
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,519
and as we were doing that

296
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
we started to be able to counter

297
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
a narrative that shipped had pushed

298
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,000
about the new algorithm they had

299
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,399
repeatedly claimed you know they see

300
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,079
workers online talking about it they

301
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,519
repeatedly claimed that the new

302
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,279
algorithm was more fair than the

303
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,560
previous one

304
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
and their sort of

305
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
accounting of how the algorithm worked

306
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,079
is that it

307
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,240
would pay you for your effort

308
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,360
now what effort means was never defined

309
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
um and people obviously got upset

310
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,160
um

311
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
but as we created as we started to

312
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
collect

313
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,040
data people started to feel a little

314
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,519
more empowered about speaking up and

315
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
speaking back against that narrative

316
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,920
from ships they got to the point where

317
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
we collected hundreds thousands of

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
screenshots from hundreds of people uh

319
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
over the course of just a few weeks now

320
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
i don't know if anyone here has ever

321
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,079
done like a for me i'm a researcher so

322
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,920
this is sort of like a field experiment

323
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,360
i don't know if anyone's done a thing

324
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
where they try and get several hundred

325
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,399
people to participate in a like

326
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,320
uh even even a collective action sort of

327
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,760
thing or something they think is is good

328
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
for them is benefiting them but it's

329
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
really hard

330
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,240
we had 200 people sign up and start

331
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
using this spot

332
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,839
in like the first two weeks it was

333
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,959
amazing

334
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,160
and a big uh part of this is that the

335
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
bot would actually give people feedback

336
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
about their pay

337
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,680
to them specifically which i'll talk

338
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,279
about in a second

339
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
these are this is sort of the upshot i

340
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
would say of the

341
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,560
study of the sort of blog post after i

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
analyzed a bunch of the data and talked

343
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
with workers about what they wanted to

344
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,639
see

345
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,480
and these are they show two different

346
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
things the the plot on the left

347
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
each square represents a worker

348
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,040
and it's colored by

349
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,079
how much

350
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,120
they

351
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
were getting paid their pay difference

352
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
between the first algorithm which we

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,279
call v1

354
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,200
that was like the colloquial name for it

355
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
in the organizing circles and v2 the new

356
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,480
black box algorithm so everyone in the

357
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
green is actually making more on average

358
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
with a new algorithm there are a group

359
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,839
of people who are making more money per

360
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,120
shop

361
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,880
than they were before

362
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
but then if you go down you see all

363
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,360
these folks in the yellow in the orange

364
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
and the red who effectively got between

365
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,000
you know a small to a very big pay cut

366
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
now this is effectively

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
you know for some folks it was 20 30 of

368
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
their take-home pay suddenly like that

369
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
is gone

370
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,839
they have to work more hours they are

371
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,959
less certain about how much they're

372
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,720
going to take in per week they don't

373
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,519
know if the algorithm is going to change

374
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,279
and so that was the working reality for

375
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,920
folks who experienced this difference

376
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
and interestingly

377
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,199
the plot on the right one of the things

378
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,279
that i tried to look at was

379
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,720
well you know did they just get a bad

380
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
hand like they get bad orders during the

381
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,480
time we're looking at this we did get

382
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,360
people when people submitted these

383
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,800
screenshots it was like six months of

384
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
their pay so we could see really over

385
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,199
time how much that they were making

386
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,600
and on the right uh over of course a few

387
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,760
weeks after the algorithm the new

388
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,320
payment system was instituted we looked

389
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,160
at the difference between folks in the

390
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,720
green line who were making more under

391
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
the new system

392
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,199
and folks in the red line who were

393
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,639
making less

394
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,839
and

395
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,199
what this shows is that people who are

396
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,680
making less making less consistently

397
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
there's something about those

398
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,639
workers

399
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,120
that the algorithm doesn't like the way

400
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
they shop the amount of time they spend

401
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,320
etc this is something that we've tried

402
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
to investigate further but we don't have

403
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,959
enough data and chip did not respond i

404
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
think really adequately to

405
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
these concerns we created a report they

406
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
responded saying that the data was not

407
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
representative which you know to be fair

408
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
it's true we got a bunch of people who

409
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,079
were already interested in organizing

410
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,160
wanted to donate their screenshots but

411
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,199
that's still

412
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,959
for those 40 of workers who got a pay

413
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,920
cut

414
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
and they didn't acknowledge that

415
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
but this was beyond trying to get a

416
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,240
response from ships

417
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
really useful in

418
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
drumming up support within the

419
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
organizing community for folks like

420
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,360
willie because they could show that

421
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,839
their narrative their experience was

422
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,560
actually happening

423
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
and

424
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,480
basically after the report dropped

425
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,560
another series of protests

426
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
happened

427
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
these were happening you know not

428
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,199
because of the report i want to just

429
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
make that really clear but

430
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
i don't know if you can see there's one

431
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,399
person in there with a sign that says

432
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,880
mit says ship keeps cutting pay

433
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,680
so we we got to

434
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,279
basically support

435
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,880
all of these movements

436
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
around different parts of the country

437
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,560
with this data-driven report and the

438
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
tool that we built

439
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,519
i'd like to remind you it's a texting

440
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,000
bot it like does some ocr and some

441
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,680
screenshots i hacked together the script

442
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
in an afternoon and sort of tweaked it a

443
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
little bit over time

444
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,839
that's not that bad i'm sure a lot of

445
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,519
people in this room could build that in

446
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,279
a weekend um

447
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
but it had this kind of impact

448
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,199
so i want you to sit with that a little

449
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,279
bit

450
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,079
so beyond

451
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
platform workers

452
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
which are this

453
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
big interesting important category a lot

454
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
of my work focuses on them because

455
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,759
they're managed by algorithms

456
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,600
and in the future data will be more and

457
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
more important to sort of proving a

458
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,440
counter narrative to those algorithms

459
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
data and technological tools can also

460
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
really help just everyday workers normal

461
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,040
folks folks in office jobs folks who

462
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
do manual labor folks who work in

463
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
warehouses and so i want to share with

464
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,320
you

465
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,759
some of

466
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,880
our work building tools for more general

467
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,199
organizing and again one of the things i

468
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,639
just want to stress is how simple a lot

469
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,399
of these tools are they're not super

470
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,040
complicated um folks here can work on

471
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,280
these so

472
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
i'm going to motivate this also with

473
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
another big problem

474
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,039
wage theft

475
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
so

476
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,799
wage theft is an enormous problem

477
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,799
globally and especially in the united

478
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,679
states wage left happens when you work

479
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
some hours and you don't get paid for

480
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,839
them or you're supposed to get benefits

481
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
but you don't

482
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
some folks argue that many platform

483
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,039
workers are experiencing wage theft

484
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,720
because they are misclassified as

485
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
contract workers instead of employees

486
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
and so if they're misclassified they

487
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,760
don't get benefits they're entitled to

488
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
that's one form of wage theft another

489
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
might be

490
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,559
you work overtime but don't get paid for

491
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,640
it or you

492
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
are given sick days as part of your

493
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,000
contract but you're not allowed to take

494
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
them

495
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,720
and all of that value all that money and

496
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,640
benefits that people lose every year

497
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,480
basically costs low wage workers almost

498
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
three thousand dollars

499
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
a year in uh in costs and when you scale

500
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
that up to

501
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,200
every low-wage worker lots and lots of

502
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,799
people in united states this is an

503
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,200
enormous problem one study looking at a

504
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,799
few major cities united states estimates

505
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,320
that about 70

506
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,160
of workers

507
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,200
have experienced some kind of wage theft

508
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,080
and

509
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
this this study the 70 percent doesn't

510
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
even count you know not getting a break

511
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,080
those overtime violations and other

512
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
problems that we do consider wage theft

513
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,120
which are

514
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,760
close to impossible to measure right

515
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
it's really hard to report it's hard to

516
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
get information about it

517
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
but data-driven tools where people

518
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
contribute information or share it and

519
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,679
then aggregate it can help with problems

520
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,960
like this

521
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
i'm going to put it

522
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
talk about wage theft like sort of in

523
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
scope a little bit more to like give you

524
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,799
a sense of the scale of the problem

525
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
this is this circle represents the

526
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
amount of money that gets stolen in all

527
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,559
robberies every year in the united

528
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,160
states this is

529
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
uh people you know robbing homes

530
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,640
burglary violent robbery on the street

531
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,160
i i don't remember actually if this

532
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
includes white collar crime probably not

533
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,039
um

534
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,200
but 438 million that's that's a lot i

535
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,640
mean you can see how tiny the circle is

536
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
we're about to get bigger

537
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
this is how much money is stolen from

538
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
workers through just hour violations so

539
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,880
you work hours

540
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,760
you

541
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,559
get your paycheck it pays you for less

542
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,000
and you're left sort of wondering what

543
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,880
to do

544
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,080
um

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
that's i mean this is not to scale

546
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,280
that's 15 billion with a b

547
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,720
dollars every year that gets stolen from

548
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
workers and that just goes from low wage

549
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,840
workers to management to owners of

550
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,960
companies

551
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,240
it's just this massive wealth transfer

552
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,280
and

553
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
people estimate that all wage theft

554
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
which includes those overtime violations

555
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
other benefits stuff like that

556
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
might be up to around 30 billion dollars

557
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,640
a year

558
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
this is huge this is like a really

559
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
important problem and this is a big

560
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,840
issue if you think about income

561
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,080
inequality

562
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
and one thing that we're trying to do

563
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,440
is build tools that let people record

564
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,400
their work

565
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,159
share that information with researchers

566
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,440
advocates and organizers and use it to

567
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
prove working time

568
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
prove working conditions and support

569
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,480
workers narratives

570
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,039
there's a whole host of like different

571
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,600
projects around this kind of work but

572
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,720
the thing i want to really talk about

573
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,159
here is this

574
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
tool that we're building called we clock

575
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,880
so we clock which is this app on the

576
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,799
left you can download it it's sort of

577
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,720
like weird it's like a research app

578
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,559
basically at the moment but it basically

579
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,120
operates like strava for work it

580
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
basically takes all the sensors on your

581
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
phone location movement

582
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,159
it connects to like health kit and

583
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,039
samsung health uh environmental noise so

584
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,960
it uses your microphone if your phone

585
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,799
has one it'll measure temperature

586
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,080
because for workers in places like

587
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,360
warehouses that can be really important

588
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
and all of these different pieces of

589
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,240
just like raw data get stored privately

590
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,039
on people's devices so this is not an

591
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,280
extractive tool where i'm a researcher

592
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,679
or a company and we're storing a big

593
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
data set of people's information at work

594
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,120
this is you use this and you get the

595
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
data and you get to choose what to do

596
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,039
with it

597
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,200
which is crucial i think in the working

598
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,120
in the worker movement workers are

599
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,799
already

600
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
sort of subject to enough extraction

601
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
all of these tools are tried we try to

602
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
design them so that they're empowering

603
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,480
rather than extractive

604
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,280
and the idea here is

605
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
to automatically track

606
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,280
basically anything you could think of

607
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
that would be

608
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
relevant to

609
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,799
proving your experience as a worker

610
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,520
and one of the issues here is that even

611
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,159
with you build an app it creates a data

612
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,039
set

613
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,440
unionists are still not technologists so

614
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,600
we have to do work to

615
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
build up a digital literacy and the

616
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
capacity inside of the movement so

617
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,440
another thing that we do and that folks

618
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,679
could participate in is doing things

619
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,440
like running workshops sharing how to

620
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,159
use tools like weak clock or even just

621
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,000
like even spreadsheet tools honestly

622
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,480
with some worker organizers to track

623
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,880
time track hours and create a working

624
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
record

625
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,760
so we've done this over the past year

626
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
where we

627
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,480
we run digital workshops over zoom with

628
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,200
trade unionists from around the globe

629
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,640
and some of these folks these are folks

630
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,200
who don't have laptops who you know zoom

631
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,120
in on a phone uh

632
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
with inside of like a barn with a bunch

633
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,200
of chickens and they're trying to

634
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
figure out how to use their phone

635
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,000
to

636
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,080
make it easier for their

637
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
workers that they represent to prove

638
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,960
that they worked some hours

639
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,000
and

640
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
that sort of

641
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,039
practice of

642
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,320
teaching people how to use data how to

643
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,520
think about it

644
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
is also a crucial important part of the

645
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
movement i want to i want to suggest

646
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,919
that you can think about it as

647
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,840
sharing information with folks making it

648
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,480
more accessible to to people who don't

649
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
have access to training about how to use

650
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,200
these tools

651
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,280
and but we know that building tools like

652
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,440
that are just the start so we're trying

653
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
to create something

654
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,480
it would be lovely if some of you became

655
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
involved in this in the future as we

656
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,640
build it out called the workers tech hub

657
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,600
this aims to be a kind of

658
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
community of practice for technologists

659
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
public interest folks workers worker

660
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,440
organizers advocates researchers to help

661
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,919
build a technology practice around labor

662
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,559
organizing and collecting workplace data

663
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,840
but from the worker perspective

664
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,760
this uh these are sort of the main

665
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,320
things that we think it entails for the

666
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,960
most part right so engaging workers

667
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,360
engaging labor unions

668
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,960
not all workers especially united states

669
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,799
are in labor unions a lot of them are in

670
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
informal or other kinds of worker groups

671
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,440
like worker centers but they can also

672
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,480
help

673
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
collect data and aggregate it

674
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,159
but when data gets aggregated

675
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,600
understanding data stewardship and

676
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
governance so who gets control of the

677
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
data who gets access to it how do you

678
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,720
mediate that access and how do workers

679
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,120
maintain consent over who can actually

680
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
see their working time because some of

681
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,279
that stuff is very sensitive

682
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,360
that needs work

683
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,039
like doing stuff like we did in that

684
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,080
first project i mentioned where you

685
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
audit new algorithmic management

686
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,440
technologies is a huge interesting

687
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,960
future and now area of work um doing

688
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,240
these kinds of community audits of uh of

689
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,520
management tech

690
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,720
um

691
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,000
these kinds of technologies like

692
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,440
platforms that

693
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,080
give contract workers a job based on

694
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,520
some criteria

695
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,000
uh are going it's going to spread to

696
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
other areas of work in the near future

697
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,360
um

698
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,440
already there's plenty of new platforms

699
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,919
that do things like try to giggify

700
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,279
nursing

701
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
try and do this do this often for

702
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
freelancing work creative work

703
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
writing

704
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,559
and as people's jobs are more and more

705
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,120
algorithmic algorithmically mediated

706
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,919
we're going to need access to data and

707
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,559
tools to try and counter test and

708
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,240
inquire about how those systems work

709
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,919
so

710
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,600
these are these are two examples of

711
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
tools we built as part of so we clocks

712
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
the app

713
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
but

714
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
you do generate all this data uh and

715
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
it's

716
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,080
um you know as far as data goes it's

717
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,559
clean it's generated from a phone um it

718
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,760
sort of looks like that that's basically

719
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,600
the raw data on the right

720
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,799
and

721
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,760
but like imagine a

722
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
construction worker opening a google

723
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,919
sheet to that

724
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,720
um hard to know what to do so

725
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,000
we're building a bunch of different

726
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,520
tools and these are like very hacked

727
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,600
together all of it is open source

728
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
the one on the left is a

729
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,679
little app that i'm building that lets

730
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,559
folks

731
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,080
that lets folks

732
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
basically upload their

733
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
a zip file of data they export from

734
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
weclock

735
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,679
and this focuses on location data so for

736
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,080
workers who

737
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,400
work in a particular location an office

738
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,120
a

739
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
work site

740
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
often location is all you need to prove

741
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
that you are working during a certain

742
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,559
time of day

743
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,720
one example of this for is construction

744
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
workers who work on a work site often

745
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,320
get paid informally they get paid like

746
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
cash right and so

747
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
sometimes some departments of labor have

748
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,400
told me that construction workers will

749
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,919
get paid in cash months and months and

750
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,799
months

751
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,880
then not get paid

752
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
how do you prove that you stopped

753
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
getting paid or that you were even

754
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,360
working there if you don't have

755
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
contracts you got paid using this

756
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,080
informal mechanism for months and months

757
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,000
the employer says oh i never even hired

758
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
that person

759
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,720
what do you do

760
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,440
one way is to

761
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
this this uses some clustering and

762
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,960
location analysis or just geofencing to

763
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,840
figure out when people were at work

764
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,159
and signs that information so that you

765
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,080
know it wasn't tampered with

766
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,360
and we're building in tools to allow

767
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
people to do things like take photos of

768
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,640
that pay

769
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,440
and to prove uh using something called a

770
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,720
tool called proof mode out of the

771
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,559
guardian project

772
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,720
that if that wasn't tampered with so you

773
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,320
can take that to

774
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,200
a department of labor make a wage claim

775
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
and suddenly the worker has better

776
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
records than the employer

777
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,760
done deal

778
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,440
that's the idea anyway

779
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,679
in this tool on the right i wanted to do

780
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,760
an interactive thing but it's sort of

781
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
difficult to be honest from the stage so

782
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
i'm just going to show you a picture of

783
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,399
one of the one of the screens

784
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
it's just basically another example of

785
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,159
trying to look at uh

786
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,919
pay

787
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,039
so

788
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,600
we can do things like

789
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,120
look at

790
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,760
people's movement so front of house back

791
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,720
of house workers for example in new york

792
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,080
you get paid differently if you're

793
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,640
waiting tables or if you're in the back

794
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
doing scheduling or reservations or in

795
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,679
the front doing scheduling or

796
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,880
reservations

797
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,120
but that work looks different from your

798
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,799
phone's perspective if you're waiting

799
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,840
tables you're moving around really

800
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,279
quickly you're

801
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,600
bouncing up and down you're on your feet

802
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,880
but if you're doing back of house work

803
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,240
you're sitting

804
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,080
those two things get paid differently

805
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
improving those hours is one form one

806
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,760
big form of wage theft in the service

807
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,960
industry

808
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,679
so

809
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,240
one thing you can do is really easily

810
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,000
it's rough but you can like just set

811
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,840
thresholds for some of that sensor data

812
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,200
apple health samsung health make it

813
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,559
really easy to measure things like

814
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,720
standing time walking time etc

815
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,679
and workers can use this tool to mark

816
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,480
off

817
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,080
you know when they were standing sitting

818
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,760
have the associated data

819
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,360
and then calculate their what their

820
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,720
wages should have been

821
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,679
and then look at the difference

822
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,919
this is early but you know you can see

823
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,360
it's just hacked together it's a google

824
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,440
sheet like just basically a template but

825
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
that's actually the best version of this

826
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,039
for folks because

827
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,120
anybody who is not trained as a computer

828
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,919
scientist or you know is a hacker can

829
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,919
sit on a spreadsheet at least and like

830
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,880
poke around and make plots

831
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,799
with like minimal training

832
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,240
so making these tools accessible is

833
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,559
really important again

834
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,559
as part of our workshops you know we

835
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
focused on wage theft but some of the

836
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,440
workers had really interesting campaigns

837
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,960
um they had different ideas of how to

838
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
use the same tools

839
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,919
so another thing that i thought was

840
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,640
really nice is that i sort of

841
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,240
we clock is this really general purpose

842
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,080
thing if you download it you'll see that

843
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,799
it has no direction it just sort of like

844
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,480
collects a lot of information from your

845
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
phone for you

846
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
and i've always wanted it to be more

847
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
pointed more specific maybe geared

848
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,080
specifically towards wage theft and

849
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,240
calculating those lost wages but the

850
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,440
flexibility of the tool has actually

851
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,679
been really beneficial because

852
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,039
workers themselves come up with these

853
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,480
creative ways of using it so the these

854
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
are three campaigns that came out of our

855
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,000
workshop that workers created and

856
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,080
started using weclock to collect data on

857
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,640
and then these tools the spreadsheet the

858
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,039
little web app thing to

859
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,760
uh all through on the one on the left is

860
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,799
probably the one where i thought that i

861
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,240
thought was most

862
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
creative and different that we like you

863
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,520
know we just wouldn't have thought about

864
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,159
it um this campaign was about workers uh

865
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
who often had to leave the workplace

866
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,520
really late at night so

867
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,480
you're uh you know i think this was in

868
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
london and people are getting home late

869
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,360
at night they're taking the train

870
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,120
they're taking public transit

871
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,039
and some folks felt really unsafe during

872
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,760
their transit getting home they wanted

873
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
the workplace to

874
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,840
a like kind of like see them validate

875
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
that like they felt unsafe in these

876
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,799
particular locations and then b

877
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,080
provide them with alternate transit

878
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,360
options like a bus a shuttle something

879
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
but to actually

880
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,960
like convince

881
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,720
management that folks were feeling

882
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
unsafe and where and what commutes they

883
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,320
should really focus on

884
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,480
this organizer took the weclock app gave

885
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,360
it to workers and had them record their

886
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
location which happens

887
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,559
by default

888
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,720
and then answer little survey questions

889
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,679
about um you know when did you feel most

890
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,360
feel unsafe during your commute what

891
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,399
location did you like do you wish that

892
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,600
you had

893
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,519
maybe been inside or something like this

894
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,559
um

895
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,640
and this is a really creative use of the

896
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
tool

897
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,360
this campaign's still ongoing so i don't

898
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
know exactly how it's rolling forward

899
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
now

900
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,559
but

901
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,720
one of the lut design lessons here is

902
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,200
when you are building tools for workers

903
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
make them extensible make them things

904
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,120
that folks can play with and mold to

905
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,760
their own needs because workers know

906
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
sort of the problems they have

907
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,120
this is a core problem in designing

908
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,720
technology right is you have a group of

909
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
folks you're the technologist you're the

910
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
designer you have an idea of what their

911
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,640
problem is in the worker context it's so

912
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,880
diverse it's so varied but they have

913
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,159
such a

914
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,559
domain expertise in the issues that

915
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,840
they're facing

916
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,440
that working with them not just like

917
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,960
designing for them but working with them

918
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
and having them be a part of that

919
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,760
process is really crucial so if you do

920
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,440
engage in any of this work build any

921
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,039
technology with workers

922
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,360
try to have them just at the table

923
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
like we did with the black box thing

924
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,960
like we're doing here where folks design

925
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,480
their campaign and we'll use this to

926
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,240
design the you know the tech in the

927
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,200
future to make this this workable

928
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,799
um

929
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,440
i'm i'm almost finished i want to talk

930
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
about some

931
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,159
general obstacles to these projects um

932
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,799
because it's not i keep saying how easy

933
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,559
it is

934
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,919
but it's not super easy

935
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,799
there's a few different pieces here that

936
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,799
are moving that are part of like larger

937
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,640
conversations around technology as well

938
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,559
that

939
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,120
are big hurdles for technologists and

940
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,200
workers alike

941
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,279
so i'll use an example to talk about

942
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,720
some of them

943
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,960
this is something called

944
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,120
the module platform

945
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,000
it's

946
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,120
basically

947
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,519
a belt

948
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,720
that you wear

949
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,559
and the belt buckle is packed with

950
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,519
sensors so it tracks your location it

951
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,279
tracks your uh

952
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,799
actually like blue i think it uses

953
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,799
bluetooth

954
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,159
signal strength to communicate with

955
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,080
other belts to figure out how close you

956
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,919
are to other warehouse workers i think

957
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,200
that's how they do their contract

958
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,840
tracing um that's labeled up there

959
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,159
and it just has temperature detection so

960
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,039
like

961
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,039
you know a lot of stuff actually that

962
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,960
our app does

963
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,480
but on behalf of the employer

964
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,960
and their killer feature is really

965
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
measuring when people bend down in an

966
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,799
unsafe way in a warehouse to reduce

967
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,720
injuries so this plot this plot over

968
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,040
here on the right is their

969
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,159
analysis of injury rates after

970
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,679
implementing using this technology

971
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,359
but there's a problem here just like

972
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,119
there was a problem with

973
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,440
ship's narrative about

974
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,719
the new algorithm how do you verify that

975
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,679
and how do you know how they're

976
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,040
measuring injuries

977
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,879
or what the sensory data they're using

978
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,159
looks like to actually measure when

979
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,760
people are bending

980
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,440
and picking stuff up

981
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
if you're a worker and you're organized

982
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,599
and you have a team of folks who is

983
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,200
critical of that what do you do

984
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,800
right now

985
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,839
you have

986
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,760
really no recourse you can try and

987
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,839
collect that data yourself using tools

988
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,199
like we clock that's part of why we're

989
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,399
building them

990
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,399
but if you wanted access to that data

991
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,320
even if you're in california under the

992
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,719
ccpa the new privacy law that allows you

993
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,880
to submit access requests to companies

994
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
like the gdpr for folks who are familiar

995
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,480
with privacy law

996
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,400
you can't get access to that information

997
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,160
because you're a worker everything you

998
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,839
generate is the property of your

999
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,960
employer for the most part

1000
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,560
a lot of that information is covered

1001
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,720
under trade secret ip law

1002
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,359
and this directly butts heads against

1003
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,200
our notions of privacy

1004
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,760
and against what's uh useful and really

1005
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
needed in the worker movement in the

1006
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,880
near future

1007
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,320
we don't have uh there are no good

1008
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
answers to this right now

1009
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,200
not in the eu really and not here these

1010
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,359
are like really big open questions about

1011
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,160
how

1012
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,560
legal institutions should treat data for

1013
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
folks who are

1014
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,359
working

1015
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,400
um

1016
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,599
i actually have one of these belts i

1017
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,119
bought one

1018
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,680
um if anyone's interested in poking

1019
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,200
around and figuring out how they do what

1020
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,520
they do

1021
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,960
but there are some

1022
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,720
motions towards this this is a lot of

1023
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,000
text i'm sorry i just cripped these

1024
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,160
slides from a talk i just gave last week

1025
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,640
or a couple weeks ago

1026
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,880
so there's one really cool

1027
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,480
bill that if you're interested in this

1028
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,839
you should pay attention to it's called

1029
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,359
ab-701

1030
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,160
so

1031
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,040
ab-701 was a bill pushed by the

1032
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
warehouse workers resource collective

1033
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,280
in california

1034
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,240
and like i said ccpa california privacy

1035
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
law doesn't allow workers to request

1036
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,520
data about their work

1037
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,760
but folks who work in amazon warehouses

1038
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
like those poor folks who are wearing

1039
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,359
those module belts get instrumented

1040
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,880
constantly

1041
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
they have production quotas they have

1042
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,839
you know

1043
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,200
actual rates that they need to hit

1044
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,040
otherwise they get

1045
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,920
fired often automatically

1046
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
and

1047
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,240
these quotas have led to workplace

1048
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,400
injuries skipped breaks you know talk

1049
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,560
about wage theft

1050
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
and

1051
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,079
workers wanted to

1052
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,280
have

1053
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,680
some evidence about how these quotas

1054
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,000
were changing over time and how these

1055
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,440
quotas were affecting their working

1056
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,720
conditions

1057
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
so this bill

1058
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,440
allows workers and a third party that's

1059
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,119
the really important part because you as

1060
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,280
a worker might like you know be

1061
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,720
experiencing this but may not know how

1062
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,560
to engage in this data conversation you

1063
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,839
need a third party to be able to submit

1064
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,400
requests on your behalf

1065
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,960
lots of privacy

1066
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,720
just suggested bills or regulations

1067
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,520
don't

1068
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
really accomplish this they don't have

1069
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,119
they make it difficult for third parties

1070
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,520
to submit requests or they don't think

1071
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,599
about this collective idea of

1072
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,680
aggregating data that's about you that's

1073
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
collected by companies or by your

1074
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,079
workplace

1075
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,599
but this bill does this bill allows

1076
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,520
third parties to send those requests on

1077
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,000
behalf of warehouse workers and when

1078
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,240
they do amazon or it's you know any

1079
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,839
warehouse build but it's really about

1080
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,599
amazon um

1081
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,680
any warehouse has to respond

1082
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,920
within 90 days with basically a bunch of

1083
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,240
data about your production quota your

1084
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,119
work times any sensor data used i

1085
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,000
believe to calculate them

1086
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,839
these kinds of bills

1087
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,720
are those are the things that will push

1088
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,160
this work forward without us having to

1089
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,839
build all of this technology that just

1090
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,520
collects the same data these employers

1091
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,280
do already

1092
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,960
another benefits to doing it yourself

1093
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,440
right because you can do things like

1094
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,320
in that campaign where the worker asks

1095
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
workers questions the organizer asks us

1096
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
questions about how safe do you feel at

1097
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
this certain period of time

1098
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,119
the employer is not going to have that

1099
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,160
information

1100
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,920
right

1101
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,400
but it this makes it a lot easier

1102
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,720
for folks to be able to interrogate

1103
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,480
question and do

1104
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,720
what i call worker inquiry

1105
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,760
into

1106
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,359
algorithms and into these systems

1107
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,400
in the gdpr there's some stuff that

1108
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,960
people are exploring how to apply to

1109
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,839
these contexts so like specific states

1110
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,359
basically have to

1111
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,760
come up with rules for in the workplace

1112
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,520
context it's kind of happening now

1113
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,000
especially as folks look at more ai

1114
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
regulation

1115
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,480
a lot of this is going to get lumped

1116
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
into artificial intelligence regulation

1117
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,800
instead of data protection which is

1118
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,640
interesting

1119
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,920
there are these things called data

1120
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,599
trusts and data cooperatives and data

1121
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,760
unions which are all different

1122
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,000
ideas around

1123
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,640
aggregating and governing data

1124
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,839
collectively um consumer reports uh the

1125
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,599
consumer union the group behind them

1126
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,839
basically is building stuff around

1127
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,599
consumer data unions

1128
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,400
um

1129
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,760
but these can also be used for for

1130
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,040
workers all right he's got union in the

1131
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
name doesn't it so

1132
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,720
the idea of a union or a worker

1133
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,800
collective worker group aggregating that

1134
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,520
information but having it under you know

1135
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,359
tightly bound under legal conditions

1136
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,880
workers of the beneficiary they can't

1137
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,400
sell the data without their permission

1138
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,480
they can't use it to make something

1139
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
that's going to harm the workers

1140
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,280
these are helpful legal tools to solve

1141
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,599
really thorny issues some people try to

1142
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,760
solve these using

1143
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,920
technical approaches so you know put

1144
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
data on the blockchain audit

1145
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,160
when people access it give people voting

1146
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,000
rights um but we have way simpler legal

1147
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,320
solutions to some of those problems

1148
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,839
um

1149
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,800
the

1150
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,760
the main the main thing um

1151
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
that i i mean the main message here with

1152
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
data rights is that workers need to be

1153
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,880
involved in data stewardship they need

1154
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,319
access to the information that they

1155
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,240
produce while they're at work in order

1156
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,680
to use it for whatever they want but for

1157
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,520
organizing

1158
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,440
and we need more technologists to be

1159
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,000
building tools that allow workers to

1160
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
collect and leverage that data

1161
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,119
i'm going to end on this

1162
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,720
this is one of my favorite

1163
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,160
images from

1164
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,640
sort of deep dives into

1165
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,720
labor history in the history of

1166
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,560
scientific management which is sort of

1167
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,520
like the old school

1168
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,720
intellectual

1169
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,960
grandfather of algorithmic management

1170
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,599
that we now see on platforms

1171
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,640
this is called a stereocyclochronograph

1172
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,040
this was taken in 1913

1173
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,319
1913 this is a long exposure photograph

1174
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,079
of someone's hands

1175
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,079
with light bulbs on the end of their

1176
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,280
fingers

1177
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,119
this is taken by frank and lillian

1178
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,480
gilbreth

1179
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,119
they're sort of like the grandparents of

1180
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,440
scientific management they developed all

1181
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,960
these insane technologies to measure

1182
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,440
how people did certain jobs in factories

1183
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,839
and in textile

1184
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,880
mills and i think in hospitals

1185
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
and the goal of these photographs these

1186
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,359
are some of the first stereo

1187
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,640
photographs that were ever taken

1188
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,560
stereoscopic photographs was for

1189
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,640
measuring worker behavior at on job um

1190
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
the goal of a stereocycle chronograph

1191
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,960
like this i think that's how you say it

1192
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,720
is to help decipher those precise

1193
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,119
movements associated with faster or

1194
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,040
safer performance on some task nobody

1195
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
knows what this is actually illustrating

1196
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,560
what task it is

1197
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,599
but i think the image is kind of cool

1198
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,240
enough by itself

1199
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,040
and the thing i want to sort of

1200
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,280
bring to folks attention is that

1201
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,079
back

1202
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,040
then

1203
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,599
getting your photograph taken was a kind

1204
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,720
of event

1205
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,119
not an everyday occurrence

1206
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,280
this was think of this as like early

1207
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,800
data collection

1208
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,720
your motion getting collected by a

1209
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,079
camera

1210
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,880
by

1211
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,000
two folks

1212
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
you know on the other side of the table

1213
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,000
from you it's personal and

1214
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,760
a lot of these workers when they were

1215
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,920
studied in this way they got a picture

1216
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,720
back

1217
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,359
they got a copy of their

1218
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,560
data

1219
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,720
and it was something that showed them a

1220
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,880
different perspective on their own work

1221
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,760
and their own life

1222
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,359
that process was not quite as extractive

1223
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,680
as the ones we have today where people

1224
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,760
wear a belt and you never see the result

1225
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,640
and the company posts a report that

1226
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,280
talks about reducing your lumbar injury

1227
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,440
but all you feel is a vibration on your

1228
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,119
back every time you lean down to pick up

1229
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,520
a box

1230
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,119
while this this was used to measure

1231
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,240
their work but this is still a

1232
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,319
photograph of someone and the process by

1233
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,319
which it was generated

1234
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,720
speaks to that it's it's

1235
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,680
it was personal and it presented folks

1236
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,560
with this alternate idea

1237
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,000
as we build tools as we build

1238
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,319
algorithmic management tools tools to

1239
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,280
organize tools for workers to take hold

1240
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,800
of their own data

1241
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,560
this is something i want folks to think

1242
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,280
about is how do you still make those

1243
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
in a way that still keeps the person

1244
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,440
there and keeps it

1245
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,680
reflective and personal

1246
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,359
i think that's all i got

1247
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,160
yeah thank you

1248
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,079
um if folks have questions um sorry

1249
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,240
there's a there's a microphone

1250
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,800
under the spotlight um you can go up and

1251
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,440
ask you can also yell one out if you are

1252
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,200
so inclined

1253
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,680
that's cool too

1254
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,000
hi i love your talk and um one of the

1255
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,440
things that you didn't

1256
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,920
exactly speak to about

1257
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,599
why people should you know have some

1258
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,599
access or control their own data is just

1259
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,599
the concept of dignity and i think that

1260
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,079
also like personal dignity that like you

1261
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,640
shouldn't be turned into an actuator for

1262
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,359
a machine that you know you're not like

1263
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,040
a claw arm like

1264
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,480
if you don't want to have sensors put on

1265
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,640
you you shouldn't have to do that but

1266
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,720
my question about the

1267
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,680
uh

1268
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,440
was about what you showed

1269
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,599
earliest on with shipped

1270
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,280
and um

1271
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,359
to sort of take a devil's advocate role

1272
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,000
there it said you highlighted that 41 of

1273
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,440
people were making less

1274
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,000
what percent were making more and

1275
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,240
is this the type of thing that

1276
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,560
any time you shift these things

1277
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,960
it's going to re it's like by the nature

1278
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
of changing it

1279
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,800
some behaviors are going to now be less

1280
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
rewarded some behaviors are not going to

1281
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,200
be more rewarded and what's like what

1282
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,359
would you say to the idea that

1283
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,760
you know they're still paying people

1284
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,000
a lot of people were winners here

1285
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,880
um

1286
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,359
you know what's the problem thank you

1287
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,760
yeah thanks thanks for the questions um

1288
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,000
i want to just respond to the dignity

1289
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,359
comment one of the things that they said

1290
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,160
was

1291
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
that another argument for

1292
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,240
worker about around worker data and

1293
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,400
ownership is just dignity around data

1294
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,800
collection and agency

1295
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,480
i wholeheartedly agree with that

1296
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,359
sentiment the idea that being

1297
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,720
instrumented

1298
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,960
is especially without my consent in a

1299
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,920
coercive relationship with an employer

1300
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,960
um

1301
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,480
is a little dehumanizing and it removes

1302
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,000
agency from folks especially when they

1303
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,599
don't have access to the information

1304
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,720
that gets that they're producing

1305
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,560
and your second question uh so you asked

1306
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,319
essentially uh

1307
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,079
in that system it seems like in the when

1308
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,280
the algorithm changed it seems like

1309
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
there were some folks who went out and

1310
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,599
and some folks who lost out and that

1311
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,119
might just be a natural dynamic of

1312
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,040
changing the system and so

1313
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,480
the algorithm

1314
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,119
uh the algorithmic pay cut is

1315
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,880
maybe less interesting or less important

1316
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,680
under that scheme under that that lens

1317
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,119
and we might expect that with any kind

1318
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,359
of paid change to workers

1319
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,240
get that right kinda

1320
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,400
yeah pay cut or a pay raise under the

1321
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,839
algorithm so yeah right so so the

1322
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,240
algorithm i i've speculated on what it

1323
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,839
does i'm pretty sure that what it did is

1324
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,359
it actually estimated the amount of time

1325
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,119
that it would take a shopper to go out

1326
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,000
and grab the items in a shopping list

1327
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,319
and deliver them by using like the

1328
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,079
actual spatial characteristics of each

1329
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,319
target store and where they stocked

1330
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,079
items

1331
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,480
and so there are some folks who don't

1332
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
walk as fast as their you know average

1333
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,960
walking speed concepts so they probably

1334
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,240
made poor predictions for those folks um

1335
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
for example i'm sure that there's other

1336
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
things that went into

1337
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,960
them not being able to hit the right pay

1338
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,440
amount for some folks but it's important

1339
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,200
i think two things sort of change the

1340
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,240
framing of that because i've been asked

1341
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,800
that quite a bit um the first is that

1342
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,880
the old pace game the v1 pace scheme

1343
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
although sort of like the baseline that

1344
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,480
i'm looking at um

1345
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,640
it's not like uh

1346
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,319
they their this new pay change was not

1347
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,760
necessarily they they argued that their

1348
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,680
new pay change was raising pay across

1349
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,520
the board and was fair

1350
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,559
um hey that's certainly not the case uh

1351
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,359
and certainly not like certainly not

1352
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,200
fairer um we i didn't see that same

1353
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,599
distribution of like winners and losers

1354
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,280
under the old pace game it just that

1355
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,000
didn't exist this new one created this

1356
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,040
divide

1357
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:35,920
um

1358
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,559
and that difference in pay

1359
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,880
for reasons that i don't know but

1360
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,839
are

1361
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,400
seem arbitrary to workers

1362
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,280
um

1363
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,160
strikes me as particularly unfair um and

1364
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,680
then the the second response is that

1365
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,359
that's still 40 of workers who got a pay

1366
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,440
cut that was unannounced

1367
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,920
even if this is not really about is it

1368
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,480
ethical or is it good to institute a new

1369
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,760
payment algorithm

1370
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,040
and

1371
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,800
blah blah blah like

1372
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,640
they did not disclose that folks were

1373
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,960
going to get a pay cut they didn't talk

1374
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,839
about it they didn't share that

1375
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,760
information workers didn't know

1376
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,200
this is the only way that workers found

1377
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,359
out is by aggregating that information

1378
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,640
and it's the only way that some workers

1379
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,079
knew that they were getting a pay cut

1380
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,520
because they could just think about it

1381
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,359
but all the app shows you is your list

1382
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,599
of orders over time it doesn't show you

1383
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,520
comparisons of your aggregate pay by

1384
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,040
algorithm

1385
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,839
and

1386
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,760
so that you still need to do the work to

1387
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,720
show that transparency

1388
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,520
yeah

1389
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,960
it's a good question

1390
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,280
thanks

1391
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,800
hi thanks for your talk um

1392
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,559
as a technologist who's interested in

1393
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,000
getting involved in this stuff what's

1394
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,720
the best way to start getting involved

1395
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,640
oh yeah good question i guess i didn't

1396
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,100
say that um

1397
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,280
[Music]

1398
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,200
i would say that the best way to start

1399
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,119
getting involved is to

1400
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:55,650
talk to

1401
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,800
[Music]

1402
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,599
uh

1403
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,720
local worker groups so go to work the

1404
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,240
way that i started working on this i'll

1405
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,520
share my experience about that i think

1406
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,800
that's maybe maybe probably the most

1407
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,839
helpful

1408
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,160
um i touched on that briefly earlier is

1409
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,920
i got in touch through a friend who is

1410
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,400
kind of an advocacy nerd um with folks

1411
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,599
within

1412
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,599
ships who were doing this project with

1413
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,760
willy and i was lucky enough to to meet

1414
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,800
with willie and we connected and i have

1415
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,440
the mit name behind me so it's easier

1416
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,040
it's easy for me to sort of like get

1417
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,880
folks to

1418
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,160
pay attention to me and give me

1419
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,760
opportunities honestly it's perfect it's

1420
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,839
a privilege

1421
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:36,559
but

1422
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,280
at its most basic is i talked with him

1423
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,200
and a bunch of other workers about what

1424
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,680
they were experiencing and i learned

1425
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,319
about what they were trying to do and i

1426
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,400
saw an opportunity where my skills could

1427
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,599
sort of match

1428
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,200
and help

1429
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,720
there's been plenty of other projects

1430
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,960
other situations where workers share

1431
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,040
what they're trying to do to

1432
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,839
you know fight for more equal wage or

1433
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,599
fight wage theft that

1434
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,400
don't

1435
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,760
you know sync with what i can offer as

1436
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,200
a researcher or advocate

1437
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,640
so

1438
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,119
those cases you leave alone

1439
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,160
but

1440
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,440
you can go to worker centers and the

1441
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,359
people who organize them and folks who

1442
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,520
are organizing platform workers or other

1443
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,400
folks

1444
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,160
in your local area just with like some

1445
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,920
searching shoot them an email or go to

1446
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,880
their office

1447
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,480
and just like say like hey i have 10

1448
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,800
hours a week and i have built things

1449
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,640
that look like this is there anything

1450
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,319
you know can we think of something and

1451
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
what are you looking at right now and

1452
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,359
how can i have help

1453
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,559
it's kind of like a trite thing just go

1454
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,839
talk to people but

1455
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,559
it it's really honestly true

1456
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,839
um the 15 billion dollars um that you

1457
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,599
mentioned in your presentation

1458
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,400
is that mostly from um private companies

1459
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,559
i mean public companies like amazon

1460
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,760
target or

1461
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,760
you know is it like privately held as

1462
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,520
well

1463
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,920
i don't know

1464
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,000
i'm not sure yeah

1465
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,920
where did you get that number i'm just

1466
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,920
curious um i have a source i can share

1467
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,280
with you um uh i don't remember

1468
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,680
i don't remember off the top of my head

1469
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,759
i have it in the original slides the the

1470
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
i imagine it's across public and

1471
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,400
privately held companies i i can't

1472
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,319
imagine that that number was specific to

1473
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,480
one or the other

1474
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,079
although i don't know if there's even a

1475
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,440
difference in

1476
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,520
rates of wage theft between the two

1477
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,559
not sure

1478
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,839
i imagine probably it's higher in

1479
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,200
publicly traded companies if only

1480
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,119
because of the clear profit motive for

1481
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,200
folks but

1482
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,558
yeah not sure interesting question

1483
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,839
i can't see uh really well with the

1484
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,440
lights so if people are raising their

1485
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,280
hands or something you might not be but

1486
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,599
if you are i can't really tell so if you

1487
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,000
could go to the mic

1488
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,160
no okay

1489
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,960
okay cool

1490
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,359
thanks for your time

1491
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,920
you
