00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
along a little bit faster just so we

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,119
really get to the q and a session

27
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,240
because that's

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,560
really what um we like to do and enjoy

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
and have this conversation about but in

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,399
short we're tesla science center many of

31
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,759
you have been coming here on a

32
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
consistent kind of years and checking us

33
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,280
out and our progress of what we've been

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,840
doing but back in 2012 we had run the

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
world's largest crowd fundraiser what

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,439
you don't know is that we've actually

37
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,079
been at this since 1996.

38
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
since 1996 we've been trying to save

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
nikola tesla's laboratory and it wasn't

40
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
until 2012 when we partnered with the

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
oatmeal that we were able to fundraise

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,878
1.45 million dollars and that really

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,720
allowed us to purchase the property in

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
combination with some state funding

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
so right after we purchased the property

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
you know we went to the negotiation

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
table made a lot of concessions and

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
understanding that the intrinsic value

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
for us was so much greater than the

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,800
monetary value right it wasn't anything

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,560
about that so we did a lot of

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
concessions and we had a lot of learning

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
lessons to do over the couple years

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
months weeks everything so

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
in short we purchased the property and

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,720
we went into development mode and we've

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
been able to fundraise now 11 million

58
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
out of the 20 million dollar project

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,519
it's still a long long road ahead of us

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,920
and this has not been an easy feat for

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,360
us at all but we've made some pretty

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
astronomical progress over the last two

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
years kovid has been not advantageous

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,440
for anyone for obvious reasons but it

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
really gave us some time to regroup and

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
rethink and put a year down to the

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,760
ground and adapt to some things and

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280
situations to

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
uh the way that i think a lot of us were

70
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
already thinking inside of this room but

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
the general public wasn't right so how

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,680
do we incorporate the virtual zone and

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
how do we incorporate aspects that

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,159
expand our community far beyond the

75
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,560
geographical territory of what it is and

76
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,879
the reality is that we are we have a

77
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,200
physical location but tesla science

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
center is global nikola tesla is a

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
global citizen and it's really

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
consolidating that community into some

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,879
capacity that is

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,159
not everyone can come out to warden

83
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
cliff whether that's physical because of

84
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
your limitations financial or whatever

85
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,200
it is

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
so anyways um

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
just you understand our our mission it's

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,480
up on the screen i'm not going to reread

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,519
that to you but i'm going to give it to

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,599
you really simple our goal is to really

91
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,280
make more nikola teslas right and i

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
don't mean that in terms of we're not

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
going to make a single person every

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
single one of you have an uh an aspect

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,280
of nikola tesla and so we do a lot of

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
educational programming to train and get

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,760
people to break the mold of who they are

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
right so society generally kind of puts

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
us in a little box we try to break that

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
box at box turn it upside down step

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
outside of it you know the the general

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,640
understanding is to give them the tools

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
that they need to be successful but take

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,639
it beyond and question because when

105
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,680
we're two years old we always ask why

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,519
then we get to three

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,680
we still ask them why we start getting

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
older and older and less of us really

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
just start asking and begging that

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
question why

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,680
and why is a really important question

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,400
as to who nikola tesla is you know you

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
question society what you should do the

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,479
ac distribution motor that's created by

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,560
nikola tesla was commonly questioned by

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,479
individuals and saying the science isn't

117
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
there why are you doing that nikola

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,479
tesla today the power that we have

119
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,639
inside of this room and even though that

120
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
mode ac distribution motor is over 100

121
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,759
years old we're still using it today and

122
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
this is technology that sure has some

123
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,560
improvements right but nonetheless it's

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
all about the science and it was nikola

125
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,240
tesla asking and begging that question i

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,919
was like well i don't understand why

127
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,759
we're doing this so

128
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
please question everything

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
so this is just one of my favorite

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
quotes about nikola tesla i think it

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
just tells his relationship and

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
to and taking a page from nature but

133
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,360
still working with every single one of

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,039
us in this room nikola tess is an

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,520
individual that was always working with

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
nature not against it and it's been

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,639
around for

138
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
depending on what the species is or item

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
is or whatever it is but can be millions

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
billions or even longer of years so

141
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,639
there's no need to

142
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,160
work against it it's really just take a

143
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,720
page let's learn from it

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
so let's talk about nikola tessa and

145
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
really being the futurist so

146
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,360
nikola tessa is just an astronomical

147
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,440
individual but really you got to

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,639
understand the dynamic of when he was

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,479
right so nikola tesla died in 1946

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,639
but prior to that

151
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
most people were and depending on the

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,400
timeframe he was you know he lived a

153
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,000
pretty decent life in terms of lifespan

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
but nikola tesla was surrounded by

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,400
individuals where a light bulb

156
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
was kind of at the forefront of

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,919
technology he identified as an

158
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
electrician

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
right and we don't think we think of

160
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,479
electricians today as someone you may

161
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
call you know jeff you something happens

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
in your house right you're like oh no

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,960
the electrical power maybe not jeff

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
because jeff takes care of all of his

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,199
own stuff

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,560
but

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,160
you know someone like me i'm not great

168
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
with that stuff you know this is not so

169
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,639
i'm like oh you know i'm going to touch

170
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,360
the wrong wire i'm going to get

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,199
electrocuted something's going to happen

172
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
not into it right so you call an

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
electrician they fix your house this is

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
when nikola tesla was identifying as an

175
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
electrician it was emerging science

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,280
there's a different dynamic of what it

177
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,120
is this is someone that at the time if

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
you had a light bulb you were considered

179
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
an affluent individual or have a luxury

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
inside of your house radio radio

181
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,759
communications and radio distribution

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,919
was kind of at the forefront of what was

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
happening i'm not talking about radio

184
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
today is freaking awesome and what

185
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,240
they're doing with the technology is

186
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,520
beyond however the most simplest form of

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
radio of communications was being

188
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,720
utilized back then and that was a luxury

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
so this is an individual where

190
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,080
horse and buggy were very common but yet

191
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,360
was able to think so far beyond and set

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
the tone for in things that we are

193
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
dealing with today right this is an

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
individual that would go on to predict

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,919
ai right and vehicles that can drive

196
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,840
themselves anyone ever heard of a

197
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
vehicle that can drive itself

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,039
yeah

199
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,479
it'd be go on to just have really

200
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,759
interesting predictions and we'll get

201
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,080
into those into a little bit but

202
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,319
um right here i've got a couple kind of

203
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
dynamics of different inventions that

204
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,160
nikola tessa had

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
been involved in

206
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,039
and it doesn't mean that he invented all

207
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,560
of these it means he had a hand in a lot

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,639
of these things so

209
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,919
i'm not going to read those i'm going to

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,520
share these slides with everyone so you

211
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
have these

212
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,599
but

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,680
i want to introduce first who is up on

214
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,800
this um

215
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
on this panel here so a couple things

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
unfortunately dr brian uh had pulled out

217
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,240
on this he accepted a job with the

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,840
department of defense and is going to be

219
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
working on some really astronomical

220
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,919
physics and he had to pull out so he was

221
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,759
our historian and physicist that was

222
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,120
going to be on this panel and

223
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
unfortunately mark alessi had a had a

224
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
personal issue that he had to manage but

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
was able to put together a video message

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,599
but

227
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,560
why don't we have everyone just

228
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
self-introduced on the screen let's go

229
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,560

230
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
hello everyone i'm jeffrey belez um

table talking to you wonderful people

235
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
about nikola tesla

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
um

237
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
but i figured oh my goodness gracious i

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240

240
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,279
man i've been wanting to uh

241
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
get in front of you folks for a while as

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
a speaker and um so it's it may go a

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
little bit off the rails so i apologize

244
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
about that

245
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,480
you know the presentation was supposed

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,680
to be you know we're still trying to

247
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,920
stick to it uh tesla's predictions for

248
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
the future um

249
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,279
i'm already getting ahead of myself uh

250
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,160
but

251
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
been with the organization for nearly

252
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,640
about a decade or so just been trying to

253
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
do everything i can for tesla and um

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
we'll share a little story for you uh

255
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
mid-90s

256
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,600
since the computer scene the hacking

257
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
scene bulletin boards and then came upon

258
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
2600 and then

259
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
my buddies getting into 2 600 and then

260
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,959
we find out about these meats that they

261
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,959
have in the city so mid-90s we're going

262
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,720
into the meats and just

263
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
what a different time it was you know

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,040
just meeting these individuals who had

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,640
you only knew them by their handle you

266
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
know you didn't know anybody by their

267
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
name and it was very kind of just

268
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
something very special about it so in

269
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
these meets we'd be going through the

270
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,519
city and this does tie in i'm not just

271
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
rambling too too much here um

272
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
we'd pass by different landmarks in the

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,000
city and one of the ones that i remember

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
the most was the new yorker hotel

275
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,519
and then so here we are all these

276
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,040
hackers just going through the city and

277
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
i see this plaque like oh nikola tesla

278
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,120
he lived here interesting that name's

279
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,800
popped up before

280
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,240
we have another meet we're going to

281
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
bryant park and boom something else

282
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,360
about tesla

283
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
and then other areas in the city just

284
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,959
keep bumping into tesla and then just as

285
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
everything progressed with um what i was

286
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,399
doing

287
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,000
my and you know things that i was

288
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,120
interested in

289
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,519
learning more about tesla living on long

290
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,200
island and then just finding out reading

291
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
about you know his warden cliff lab in

292
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,519
shoreham new york which is like holy cow

293
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,680
it's a town over from me so what i'm

294
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,640
really trying to get to is just the

295
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
weird connections it's like now from mid

296
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,440
90s to now

297
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,839
20 30 plus years later and here we are

298
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,240
now i'm with the tesla science center

299
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,279
presenting it hope you know with 2600

300
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,680
just being really kind of integral part

301
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,720
of my journey into to finding tesla so

302
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
tesla is just amazing to me being you

303
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,640
know an enigmatic figure from the past

304
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,519
that is still just so relevant today if

305
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,240
not more so today because we need

306
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
someone with a visionary like tesla and

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,959
the ideas that he had that we're going

308
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,440
to expand upon a little bit

309
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
so just super excited to be here

310
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
glad i got that out so we're going to

311
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,200
introduce my my good buddy ed wilson hey

312
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,440
i'm ed wilson uh amateur radio operator

313
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,079

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,680
uh long time

315
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,160
reader of 2600 so i'm really excited to

316
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,279
be here um i'm fairly new to the tesla

317
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
science center so i'm part of the b team

318
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,040
i was the backup speaker

319
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,399
so don't expect a whole lot out of me

320
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,240
i'm pretty new with the tesla science

321
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,959
center as a volunteer um

322
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
they reached out to me with my i don't

323
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
want to say expertise in radio but my

324
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
many years of experience in amateur

325
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200
radio so just recently we had started

326
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,079
the

327
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
tesla science center amateur radio club

328
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,120
and uh there's four members of the club

329
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
right now and three are on the stage and

330
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
one's in the third row

331
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
so um we're a new club that's going to

332
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,320
start out we're not going to be your

333
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,720
grandfather's amateur radio club we're

334
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,200
going to be a local as well as global

335
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,120
amateur radio club uh

336
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,440
touching on diversity and inclusion and

337
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,399
all sorts of really cool kick-ass things

338
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
uh i'm also part of the m17 project for

339
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,560
those who are in the room for the talk

340
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
before steve k2gog in the in the front

341
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
room was talking about so i've been

342
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,920
around radio a very long time and i hope

343
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,399
to help out and build a kick-ass club

344
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,000
for the tesla science center that's

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,120
going to reach a global audience take it

346
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
yeah absolutely

347
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,959
i want to expand upon that too so we're

348
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,480
just getting started so we're also

349
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
soliciting feedback so if anyone wants

350
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
to reach out to us

351
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,720
club ideas or other ideas we've got a

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
visitor center opening relatively

353
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
soonish as soon as we get the thumbs up

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
from the dec

355
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,720
but once we open that up it it really is

356
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
a pivotal point for us for educational

357
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
programming and this is a hub for us to

358
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,560
start expanding upon this so again

359
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
come on over and

360
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,120
talk to us at our booth we're going to

361
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,880
be here all weekend

362
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,399
thank you thank you and thank you jeff

363
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,680
so

364
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,800
make sure

365
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
this is the video we're having issues

366
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
with so let me make sure that this works

367
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
and the audio is good to go

368
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
yes understanding that nikola tesla is

369
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,920
pretty much the ultimate white hack

370
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
hacker and it really is the

371
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
representational story of who he is

372
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,639
right it's it's about doing something

373
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,880
for the betterment of humanity fixing

374
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,040
the problems that we have here the

375
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,920
problems of that he was working on then

376
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
continue to be persistent problems of

377
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,800
today and tomorrow so

378
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,079
let's see if we got this video working

379
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
should be some audio on this one

380
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,839
i can restart it

381
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
oh wait that the thing isn't connected

382
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,680
oh no it is it is

383
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,920
thanks

384
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
so the tesla science center we're

385
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,560
looking for audio visual people to help

386
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
us out with future talks

387
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,000
see me afterwards thank you

388
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,440
it's just trying to kick over the hdmi

389
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
oh it's there it's just really low

390
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,720
all right if we can crank it up a little

391
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,839
bit that would be awesome

392
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,399
it was a spirit of rogue experimental

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,680
rebellion

394
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,760
disruptive of established existing

395
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,920
systems with the goal of replacing them

396
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
with something better

397
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,839
he locked out conventional thinking and

398
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,760
he was a provocative force to

399
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,279
presumption

400
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,120
when people think of hacking there's a

401
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
sort of nervous admiration for the

402
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,279
genius with that special kind of talent

403
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,360
and nikola tesla certainly incited

404
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,959
feelings of nervous admiration from

405
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,519
those around him particularly his peers

406
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
he was a kind of alternative scientific

407
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
artist

408
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
like a physics punk rocker at a

409
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
different point of view to start tesla

410
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,199
saw himself not as an inventor but as a

411
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
discoverer one that reveals solutions

412
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
already in the framework of existence to

413
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
harness the real work of nature

414
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
uncovering natural secrets rather than

415
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
construction built on its limitations

416
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,759
such an improvisational spirit of

417
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,240
exploration led to the concepts of radar

418
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,199
radio x-rays robotics remote control and

419
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,199
even early computer tech

420
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
in fact his tele-automaton patent in

421
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
which a prototype was demonstrated at

422
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
madison square garden in 1898

423
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,360
utilized patents for radio wireless

424
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,519
remote control and type of early logic

425
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,920
circuit known as the nano and d gate

426
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,639
which is sort of the key to binary code

427
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,800
outside the garden it was horse and

428
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
buggy technology

429
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,839
inside

430
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,759
there was a remote controlled boat under

431
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
intelligent control

432
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,120
onlookers thought it was a trick that

433
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,360
tesla had a trained monkey inside it

434
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,240
that's how unimaginable the concept was

435
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
but of all his innovations it was his

436
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,079
induction motor an engine that could

437
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
efficiently run on alternate current

438
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
electricity that revolutionized the

439
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,480
status quo propelling the world into an

440
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,399
age of progress

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,519
without it

442
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,199
most likely electric power would have

443
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,959
been a rare luxury

444
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,600
only accessible to the wealthy

445
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,839
this motive born of tesla's fertile and

446
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,240
untarnished imagination was previously

447
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
considered an impossibility by the

448
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,880
scientific community one not achievable

449
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,639
through the laws of physics

450
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,240
tesla hacked through perceived

451
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,079
limitations of science and nature to

452
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,759
move the world forward

453
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,519
he was a rogue scientist whose

454
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,519
unconventional application of physical

455
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,520
principles created a sense of unease in

456
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,599
the world around him

457
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,760
he was a genius with an amazing talent

458
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,959
that you'd hope would be used for

459
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,520
benevolence and not maliciousness

460
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,959
one whose brilliance could reward the

461
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,520
world with free wireless energy

462
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,599
or punish it with a death ray or

463
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
earthquake machine

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
fortunately for the world

465
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,160
tesla wore a white hat

466
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
and in a way

467
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
one can describe his mission at warden

468
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
cliff as the ultimate hack

469
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
a way to disrupt the entire global

470
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
system of energy and information to help

471
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,039
the world evolve to point out the flaws

472
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
of an antiquated system

473
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,840
and spark a movement of positive change

474
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,320
to battle the titans of power and usurp

475
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
their control to place it in the hands

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
of the people

477
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,360
at wardencliff he had promised j.p

478
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,760
morgan a radio tower but his covert

479
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,080
plans were much more ambitious

480
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
free wireless power to any place on the

481
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
globe

482
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,200
with a 187 foot high tower he would set

483
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,559
energy not through the air as his

484
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,480
contemporaries were attempting

485
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,039
but through the earth itself

486
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,120
such a radical endeavor was far more

487
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
expensive than morgan's radio tower

488
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,600
according to legend after tesla revealed

489
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
the true potential of the wharton cliff

490
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,520
power station jp morgan questioned how

491
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
one would be able to meter free

492
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,960
electricity

493
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,919
just prior to defunding the project

494
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,760
sadly this would ultimately lead to the

495
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,799
end of tesla's dream at warner cliff

496
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,480
whether or not he could have achieved

497
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
the practical transmission of wireless

498
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
power is an open debate

499
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,799
one i would personally urge caution with

500
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,039
after studying his life for so long for

501
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,640
how many times did tesla achieve his

502
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,799
goal despite the prevailing scientific

503
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
consensus

504
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,280
for many

505
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,600
tesla remains a true inspiration an

506
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,480
intellectual rebel a scientific agitator

507
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
a fighter who violated the most

508
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
respected preconceived notions of what

509
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
was deemed possible a slap in the face

510
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
to a narrow-minded scientific consensus

511
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
tesla's spontaneous spirit of discovery

512
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
in my view made him the coolest radical

513
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,919
thinker on the planet

514
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,440
launching an insurrection movement

515
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,160
against the accepted scientific norms he

516
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,960
was a visionary so far ahead of his time

517
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
a genius loner

518
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,360
in a white hat

519
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,799
thank you and and thank you to joe

520
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,559
sikorski who put together that video

521
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,320
here for everyone at the hope conference

522
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
um joe sikorski sits on our history and

523
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,799
collections committee and is one of the

524
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,440
historians that helps guide and check

525
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,679
the authenticity of the history that we

526
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
articulate we are very poignant and

527
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,280
strict on what we try to talk about in

528
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
relationship to the history of nikola

529
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
tesla as it's not necessarily a linear

530
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,559
path and it's mucked by

531
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
a lot of propaganda that's circulated

532
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
around it whether it's related to edison

533
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,919
uh ac dc current wars right or

534
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,600
other kind of government conspiracy

535
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,520
theories or different things there's a

536
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,000
lot we don't know about nikola tessa and

537
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,320
even though our history collections

538
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
committee members are considered the

539
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,159
experts around the globe we continue to

540
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,000
learn as individuals and continue to

541
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,720
gather information so um you know by all

542
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,559
means always approach us you got an idea

543
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,840
got a thought you know got some

544
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
documentation send it our way we're

545
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
still people and

546
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,480
we make mistakes as well so we we try to

547
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
be correct the record as much as we can

548
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,840
right so thank you joe

549
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,320
so next thing i want to tell you

550
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,840
unfortunately mark leslie couldn't be

551
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,600
here he's our executive director he's

552
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,720
normally here on an annual basis uh our

553
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
final just kind of fell apart just

554
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
circumstances that they had going on i

555
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
think post covid um and i don't even

556
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
think we're post coveted but nonetheless

557
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,880
whatever um there's some covid situation

558
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
and ultimately some personal decisions

559
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
that needed to be made for some members

560
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,159
of our panelists and i really want to

561
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,320
thank jeff and ed for coming here today

562
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,240
and putting this together to make sure

563
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,600
that we can give you the best

564
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
presentation possible

565
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
um but we do have a message from our

566
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,200
executive director just opining upon

567
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,919
what we have done over the last year uh

568
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,200
in relationship to some of the

569
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
educational program and progress that we

570
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,919
have made i want to preface this with um

571
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
understanding we're not done

572
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,919
although it's been a long road to get to

573
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,440
where we are today

574
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,000
it's still a long road to finish

575
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
at the end of the day we've been able to

576
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
hit the 11 million dollar mark on a 20

577
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
million dollar capital campaign project

578
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,320
and in short this past year we had been

579
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,360
able to

580
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,159
uh

581
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,159
basically when covet hit reposition the

582
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,400
organization in relationship to some

583
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,480
analytical data

584
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,440
and progress reports to document it to

585
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
do what we're doing this year i'm i'm

586
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
happy to say we've applied for about 15

587
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,799
million dollars worth of grants this

588
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,679
year

589
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,520
and we hope to get a couple of those

590
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
grants and start working on the

591
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
philanthropic giving and get the musk

592
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
foundation and other organizations back

593
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,039
involved in the next step of

594
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,480
philanthropic giving so we can bring

595
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,799
this vision together and have the hope

596
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,640
conference maybe at tesla science center

597
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,039
next time right

598
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,760

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,840
center at warden cliff

605
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
site of the great inventor nikola

606
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,799
tesla's only remaining laboratory

607
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,679
tesla once said the future for which i

608

you how we're working to ensure the

611
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,360
future for nikola tesla

612
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
at the tesla science center our vision

613
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
is a world where people appreciate

614
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
tesla's contributions

615
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
are inspired by his scientific audacity

616
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
and engage in the future betterment of

617
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,600
humanity

618
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,080
by following this vision and our mission

619
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
tesla science center made important

620
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,080
progress in 2021.

621
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
i want to share those details with you

622
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,799
now along with our plans for 2022

623
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,440
and beyond

624
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,360
2021 was a challenging year globally for

625
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,400
everybody

626
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,480
including not-for-profits and the tesla

627
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,799
science center is no different

628
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,200
in fact as we were getting ready to

629
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
launch the tesla science center

630
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,799
a lot of our potential construction was

631
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,039
put on hold as permits were delayed

632
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,520
but we took the past year to look inward

633
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
and go through a strategic planning

634
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,360
process it was important for us to

635
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,679
stress test the vision we've always had

636
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,400
for the tesla science center so we hired

637
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
museum management consultants

638
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,039
mmc one of the premier strategic

639
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,120
planning firms from museums and science

640
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,279
centers nationally

641
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,679
they brought in aecom an international

642
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,840
engineering firm that actually has a

643
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,679
department that concentrates on

644
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,400
forecasts for visitorship and financial

645
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,559
operations for museums and science

646
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,799
centers prior to opening

647
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
we're excited and motivated by the

648
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,880
positive results which will help ensure

649
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
that once we open the doors to test the

650
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,440
science center next year our programming

651
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,640
and operations will be sustainable

652
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,760
furthermore in 2021 we were able to move

653
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,159
toward hybrid and in-person programming

654
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,440
again

655
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
the gates of warden cliff were open to

656
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,559
visitors from around the world for

657
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,120
historic tours and unique investigative

658
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,440
tours

659
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,799
we hosted our annual tesla birthday expo

660
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,640
to honor the inventors life and work

661
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,720
with an outdoor event that featured

662
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
robotics demonstrations steam exhibits

663
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,279
maker space lab tesla's inventions and

664
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,919
our new 3d scan of the interior of the

665
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,400
tesla lab

666
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,679
architect helped electrify the event

667
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,000
with a show that featured tesla coils

668
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
electric guitars and plenty of lightning

669
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,679
warden cliff became an open-air theater

670
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
for sounds of science an immersive

671
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
musical evening that celebrated the

672
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,159
wonders of tesla's universe and

673
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,600
connections between science and music

674
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
we collaborated with another

675
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
not-for-profit rights of spring music to

676
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,559
present a truly unique show that fused

677
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,480
music technology and tesla one of the

678
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,200
highlights of 2021 was the medal for

679
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,960
tesla program that combines

680
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,480
environmentalism

681
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,120
education and fundraising

682
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,799
it was conceived by founding board

683
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,480
member gene genova

684
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,000
who has been recycling the metal at

685
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,559
warden cliff since 2013 with a group of

686
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,120
dedicated volunteers

687
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,799
metal for tesla raised 14 tons in 2021

688
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,159
for a whopping total of over 71 tons of

689
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,440
metal collected since 2013 to help

690
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,679
preserve warden cliff and the planet

691
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,480
we're now ready to energize 2022 with

692
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,600
more bold transformative education and

693
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,679
enrichment programs

694
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,720
as host of our tesla unwired webcast i

695
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
invite you to join us for new episodes

696
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,039
in 2022 that feature real-time

697
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,240
conversations with global innovators

698
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,200
and learners of all ages will benefit

699
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,360
from expanded tours and events

700
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,520
both in person and virtually

701
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,600
these new programs include youth coding

702
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
classes and cutting edge steam programs

703
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,279
in collaboration with morrison mentors

704
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,279
we're also excited to break ground on

705
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,080
our new visitors

706
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,679
and continue renovations on tesla's lab

707
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,120
thank you for exploring the progress and

708
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,360
future at tesla science center we

709
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
welcome your involvement and invite you

710
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,320
to learn more at teslasciencecenter.org

711
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,120
so unfortunately marcolessi couldn't uh

712
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,640
join us he had a family thing that he

713
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
had to take care of but um

714
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,080
uh he wanted to make sure that uh

715
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,240
everyone knew he's been consistently

716
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
coming here every year and i get lost in

717
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
the sauce just like jeff does

718
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,080
so my job day in and day out is the kind

719
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,399
of analytics of the organization and

720
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,320
leveraging those for what is our end

721
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
goal

722
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,279
so mark alessi really gets into what

723
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,840
would be the high level information

724
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,640
i get myself lost in what is the the

725
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,000
details of what we're trying to

726
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,919
accomplish in relationship to scaling

727
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,679
the organization

728
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,480
which i generally tend to lose audiences

729
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,840
with so i won't get into

730
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,200
it but really what we want to start talk

731
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,880
start talking about is kind of some of

732
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,120
nikola tesla's uh inventions right so

733
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,440
let me just turn this up so nikola tesla

734
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,279
beyond the fact that he was an

735
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,720
individual

736
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,120
uh that was

737
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,840
really thinking about the future in such

738
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,480
a way that to the to this day some of

739
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
his predictions haven't come true right

740
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,480
or some of those predictions are still

741
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
stagnant or maybe some of those

742
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
predictions are a little bit too

743
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,000
far-fetched but um they're far-fetched

744
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
for us now and these were far-fetched

745
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,279
ideas from back then right so nikola

746
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,880
tesla being one of the individuals that

747
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,080
had the prediction in terms of

748
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
the wi-fi i'm gonna get into a couple of

749
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,720
these things artificial intelligence

750
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,799
wireless power transmission

751
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,360
and also smartphones so i'll work my way

752
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
backwards here and then i'm gonna really

753
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,799
call upon the panel just to expand upon

754
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,240
a couple of things and just have a

755
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,520
conversation and we're going to open up

756
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,799
for q a i'm trying to save us some time

757
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,000
we're going to skip probably some of

758
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,240
these but join us at our booth we're

759
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
here like i said all weekend we're going

760
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,760
to be here for as long as we want ask us

761
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,080
questions we don't have all the answers

762
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
but we will give you our business card

763
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
and we will take your information and we

764
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
will circle back so

765
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,679
um just going into smartphones really

766
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,440
it's one of those devices that i think

767
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,520
every single one of us can't live

768
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,840
without these days and um

769
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
even if

770
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,960
you're i just i don't know anyone that

771
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,919
doesn't have a smartphone at this

772
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,000
particular point right and it's really a

773
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,520
vital part where nikola tesla had

774
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,240
predicted in 1903 the prediction of the

775
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,919
cell phone right at warden cliff a

776
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,200
device that would be inside of your

777
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,440
pocket that you'd be able to take out

778
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,919
and communicate with people all over the

779
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,039
globe

780
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,240
you take it actually a little bit

781
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,679
further in a 1926 i believe article

782
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,279
where he'd start talking about the

783
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,760
intercommunication of the devices that

784
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,159
can be leveraged for live presentations

785
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
and really having what would be

786
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,960
an immersive experience right so

787
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,080
for that would be something like

788
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
facetime or something that's happening

789
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,600
in person at that moment

790
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,919
so i think we're going to skip a couple

791
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,960
of these and we're just going to call

792
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
upon i think the panel and just put up

793
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,360
my favorite quote here so before just

794
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
this is

795
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
very representational of who nichola

796
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,720
tessa was let the let the future tell

797
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,120
the truth and evaluate each according to

798
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,440
his work and accomplishments

799
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,080
the present is theirs the future for

800
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,200
which i have really worked for is mine

801
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
and i think that tells the story of who

802
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,279
is nikola tesla always talking about

803
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,440
tomorrow and at tesla science center

804
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,960
we're no different we're trying to focus

805
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,120
in on what are the far-fetched ideas

806
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,360
that sometimes are kind of intertwined

807
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,279
with some like darpa kind of stuff and

808
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,519
conversations but that's what we need to

809
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,279
go for we need to start talking about

810
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,200
our birthday party will have bring the

811
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,440
world's largest portable tesla coil

812
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,799
there's a 40-foot tessa coil it is

813
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,200
unreal but then you start thinking about

814
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
so what you got a tesla coil what does

815
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,559
it mean well that tesla coil is being

816
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,960
utilized by google x labs to study

817
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
lightning with an end goal of being able

818
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,600
to harness the power of of lightning and

819
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,440
it's a renewable energy resource that is

820
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,000
not limited to just this planet of earth

821
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,720
but planets all over the universe so the

822
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
idea of being able to travel and go to

823
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
super earths or different earths that

824
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,519
are all over and utilizing as a

825
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,840
renewable energy resource is beyond and

826
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
something that may not happen during our

827
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,960
lifetime

828
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
however those are the conversations that

829
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,799
we want to continue to have and those

830
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,919
are the individuals we want to

831
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,679
collaborate with we're really a

832
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,600
centralized hub for communication for

833
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,760
individuals with far-fetched ideas so if

834
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,600
you've got one come join us

835
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
so um

836
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
ed you want to go first and give us a

837
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,360
little bit of kind of dynamic of

838
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,679
radio and all things

839
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,919
so

840
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
nikola tesla's

841
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,000
work with wireless transmissions has

842
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,760
definitely led to

843
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,320
radio as we know it today

844
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,480
most people of the younger generation do

845
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
not realize that

846
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
the device that's in everybody's pocket

847
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
is actually a radio it's not a cell

848
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,919
phone as old-timers like me it's not a

849
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,080
phone like old people like me

850
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,720
know a phone to be so um

851
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,840
his work with radio and uh

852
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,200
communications is with us today and and

853
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,519
everything around us as far as you know

854
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,519
radios are used everywhere emergency

855
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,240
communications and amateur radio geeks

856
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
like myself and just broadcast

857
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
am and fm radio stations that are still

858
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,519
out there i know a lot of you younger

859
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,039
people don't listen to it everything's

860
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,080
streaming now but nikola tesla was

861
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,840
as far as i'm concerned the father of

862
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,720
radio and uh most people contribute that

863
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,519
to marconi but i believe the supreme

864
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,880
court in 1946

865
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,399
right after his death

866
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,000
yeah they uh

867
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
they deemed that morocco nee's patents

868
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,279
were invalid and

869
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,600
most of marconi's works were based on

870
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,159
everything that tesla was working on a

871
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,640
lot of it at warden cliff warden cliff

872
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,440
is actually about 60 miles east of here

873
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,360
so it is relatively close if anybody

874
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,919
does live in new york

875
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,399
like doug it said earlier we are having

876
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,960
a birthday celebration in september so

877
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,399
please come out and

878
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,440
have a tour of the campus and celebrate

879
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,039
our belated

880
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,279
tesla birthday party you know ed what i

881
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,880
find interesting about radio is that

882
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,480
it's

883
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,360
power

884
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,519
and communications right and i think

885
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,679
most of us think of radio

886
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,120
as let's jam out in the car but really

887
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,600
radio is two-pronged and i think um do

888
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,720
you want to tell the audience a little

889
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
bit about the tel automaton um

890
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,880
that had happened over here in shoreham

891
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,039
sure so the telethon of tele

892
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,639
uh tesla's 31-foot remote control boat

893
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,520
um

894
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,000
that was in 1898

895
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
or so

896
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,280
i don't recall the exact year but that

897
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,679
sounds right about right so

898
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,159
he showed off this 31 foot remote

899
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,000
control boat which was unheard of at the

900
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,119
time um and people were just amazed by

901
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,280
the fact that he was sending commands to

902
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,520
it wirelessly

903
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,960
people were questioning whether he had a

904
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
trained monkey inside of it at one time

905
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,199
to do all of these controls

906
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,760
but uh that that awesome

907
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,879
patent that that he had put forward is

908
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,679
probably uh the first drone

909
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,000
essentially right yeah of its type so

910
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,839
yeah pretty interesting which led to him

911
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,079
being nicknamed the uh the wizard yeah

912
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,918
because of the uh the magic that he had

913
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,280
within

914
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,359
it's unreal you know it's this is a time

915
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,880
where everyone's in horse and buggy for

916
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,640
the most part right so he had shown this

917
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,480
off and people were like no i can't

918
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
believe that's true there's a trained

919
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,079
monkey inside of there but even more so

920
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,920
the science that's inside of it it's the

921
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,160
first use of binary

922
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,720
uh binary code now he didn't utilize it

923
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
in software base this was this was a

924
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,200
hardware and it just basically told the

925
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,240
device whether it can go left or right

926
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
he'd go on to pitch this to the us army

927
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,920
and say hey

928
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,359
do you guys want to buy this you could

929
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,520
use it for defense maybe you tied to

930
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,480
your missiles you know what do you think

931
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
and the us army says

932
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,280
no thanks not interested can you imagine

933
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,839
any military around the world

934
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,720
without radio controlled devices

935
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,160
drones or anything else it just uh it'd

936
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,640
be insane but the this is this is what

937
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,000
he was doing on

938
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
he was working on things that were very

939
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
progressive and so big that sometimes

940
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,480
even individuals that were these large

941
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,040
corporations that were uh investing

942
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,760
heavily in this case war

943
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,119
didn't even see the vision they didn't

944
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,640
see a practical purpose for it and they

945
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,200
were they're that narrow-minded in terms

946
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,800
of what it was but maybe it's for the

947
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,480
better for that one i think it just it

948
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
ties into the quote perfectly if you

949
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,560
really think of tesla as the person

950
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,880
nearly everything he was doing was for

951
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,040
the betterment of mankind it wasn't

952
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,760
about the monetary aspect for it

953
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
you know and so when we started this

954
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,960
they were thinking of you know tesla's

955
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,520
predictions of the futures

956
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,720
awesome folks over there i know they've

957
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,160
heard me talk about it a bunch of times

958
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,280
over the folks who've seen me at the

959
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,920
tables just talk about tesla's vision of

960
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,160
the future and how he was able to map it

961
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,119
out

962
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,560
with the technology that he helped build

963
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,920
and he saw how it would unfold now

964
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,520
they just weren't ready for it at the

965
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,880
time you know the people just couldn't

966
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,960
understand it couldn't grasp it you know

967
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,480
one of the the thoughts i have that

968
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,520
really

969
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,760
imagine being this man with these ideas

970
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,040
and really knowing in your heart how

971
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,400
it's going to unfold

972
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,000
but um

973
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,520
just the world wasn't ready for it yet

974
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,280
it was a man out of time you know people

975
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,880
weren't grasping it i mean look at today

976
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,800
tesla was on long island in 1901 it's

977
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,040
2022. we're still trying to unravel what

978
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,440
he did then but even more so it's been

979
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,680
so much time since he's he's passed he's

980
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,000
still such an enigmatic figure to us and

981
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,079
we're drawn to him i'm drawn to him i

982
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,680
mean look at all the folks that are here

983
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
just hearing us talk is just so amazing

984
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,400
just how important he is you know and it

985
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,560
just rings true because he he wanted to

986
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,320
propel us forward and that's what i

987
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,400
think so many of us resonate with in

988
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,960
inside especially the hacker spirit

989
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,839
you know

990
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,800
we want to tinker you know to understand

991
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,200
it to break it down and also to make it

992
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,480
better to

993
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,720
try and do something with our lives and

994
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,480
you know so but it was kind of funny in

995
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,320
in doing that i'm so used to talking

996
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
about all the cool stuff that tesla was

997
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
right man tesla was on the money but it

998
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,760
was interesting because he was he was

999
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,000
off the mark sometimes also and you

1000
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
figure but it was also

1001
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
product of the time in some cases you

1002
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,680
know the biggest one that usually comes

1003
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,920
up is the eugenics aspect

1004
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,000
he was on board with it you know that

1005
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,920
was kind of a recurring threat of the

1006
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
time that he thought

1007
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,800
you know

1008
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,079
forced sterilization and um you know

1009
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,640
weeding out of the undesirables

1010
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,520
you know today just unfortunately it's

1011
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,280
that feels like that thought process is

1012
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,359
coming back you know and coming you know

1013
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,240
um

1014
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,359
so i don't know so i'm going off the

1015
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,200
rails a little bit but just

1016
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,079
hope

1017
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,520
you know i know it's hackers on planet

1018
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,599
earth but it's it's hope for for the

1019
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,520
future and like we don't even have any

1020
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,359
buildings open yet and just look at the

1021
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,200
the excitement and just the passion

1022
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,119
that's still you know out for nikola

1023
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,040
tesla and for more importantly for his

1024
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,280
work and just trying to do right in the

1025
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,800
world um

1026
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,560
it's sad because some of his other you

1027
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,359
know

1028
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,280
ideas predictions that he had that did

1029
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,720
not come true

1030
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,599
were

1031
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,280
um

1032
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,200
his thoughts that or what he thought he

1033
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
could do with his technology how his

1034
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,800
technology would better mankind like one

1035
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,200
of the quotes i came across really kind

1036
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,880
of broke my heart a little bit you know

1037
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,520
and uh he's got long before the next

1038
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,640
century dawns systematic reforestation

1039
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
and the scientific management of natural

1040
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,599
resources will have made an end of all

1041
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,440
devastating droughts

1042
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,520
forest fires and floods

1043
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
the universal utilization of water power

1044
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,599
and its long-distance transmission uh

1045
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,359
will supply every household with cheap

1046
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,400
power

1047
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,320
what's going on in the world right now

1048
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,880
or it's it's completely off the rails

1049
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
you know in terms of of those aspects

1050
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
and it's sad that you know he was really

1051
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,040
hoping his technology would help usher

1052
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,240
in you know a better future for for

1053
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,400
for all and so just kind of hoping that

1054
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,920
that's what we can try and keep that

1055
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,640
passion alive and um

1056
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,480
even though he was wrong in some aspects

1057
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,560
he just gotta keep rolling with it you

1058
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,320
know um

1059
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,760
jeff and i were talking about this

1060
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,680
earlier right and i think it's

1061
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,960
interesting that

1062
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,720
jeff is saying well we've got a couple

1063
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,960
predictions of nikola tesla

1064
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,240
that were not on the money or not

1065
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,839
wrong but like there's some that are

1066
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,920
just kind of also debatable it's like

1067
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
are they wrong or

1068
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,599
has it not happened yet

1069
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,720
right so like this is a far-fetched idea

1070
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,880
he said at one point that he was

1071
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
trying to harness the power of the

1072
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,720
cosmos personally i have no idea what

1073
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,800
that means like what are the cosmos what

1074
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,280
is the power of the cosmos but it is

1075
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,040
interesting to think and then we do have

1076
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,880
conversations that revolve around

1077
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,520
whether it's the james webb telescope or

1078
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,200
we've got our friends over at cern that

1079
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,640
just recently discovered three new

1080
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,440
particles right we we we're still in

1081
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
we don't know it all and untheorized

1082
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,319
physics right and the unknown aspect of

1083
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,720
it is still an evolving conversation and

1084
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,680
it's still

1085
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,800
uh a learning process so what that means

1086
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,440
beyond me personally and i think in that

1087
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,240
case you see like the the

1088
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
the kind of optimism that he has with

1089
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,200
science inside of it but the reality is

1090
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,119
that nicola tesla's gone and it's up to

1091
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,960
each one of us inside of this room to

1092
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,680
continue that legacy inside of it so

1093
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,160
people who want to prevent deforestation

1094
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,079
in relationship to science you know i'm

1095
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,839
i'm sure many of you guys go on reddit

1096
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,000
and most recently watching that worm

1097
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,680
that can eat plastic

1098
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
that's what i'm talking about you know

1099
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
there's those are the types of

1100
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
technology that we need to do in order

1101
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,920
to preserve nikola tesla's legacy some

1102
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,680
of his predictions you know he would go

1103
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,240
on and say at wardencliff i like the

1104
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
power of the sun only if we can harness

1105
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
it

1106
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
he wasn't kicking rocks when mit

1107
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,680
discovered how to ultimately uh harness

1108
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,079
the power of the sun with the fosa um pv

1109
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,720
cell i think it was in the 80s

1110
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,319
but he had other things in terms of like

1111
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,480
he wanted to really connect the world in

1112
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,200
relationship he said we if we're able to

1113
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,520
connect the world in relationship to

1114
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,160
communication devices we'd have a huge

1115
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,400
operational brain

1116
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,319
you know it's the internet now and so

1117
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,800
there's just a plethora of different

1118
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,880
inventions that he has but do you want

1119
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
to go into some of the other ones

1120
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,400
touching on that was super super quick

1121
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,440
so i think we're running out a little

1122
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,560
time here so i don't know if we want to

1123
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,440
either grab a couple questions or

1124
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,640
like i said we're going to be at the

1125
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,680
tables you know for the rest of the

1126
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,440
weekend one that came up and i don't

1127
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
have the direct quote for me but the

1128
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,440
gist of it was was he felt with his you

1129
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,880
know world brain system you know whereas

1130
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,280
information will flow as it does almost

1131
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,040
now instantly he felt that it would

1132
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
actually turn society into more of a

1133
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,440
utopian society because now all nations

1134
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,520
all people can share with each other and

1135
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
the information's free

1136
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,960
what are we seeing now

1137
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,920
you know

1138
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,000
we can communicate instantly with each

1139
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,280
other but

1140
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,960
it's who's controlling that information

1141
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,480
that's out there to the masses that are

1142
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,800
just driving people in all these crazy

1143
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,200
different directions so it's it's sad

1144
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,560
you know that he thought that it would

1145
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
be you know that or just like the the

1146
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,319
death ray you know he thought it would

1147
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,960
be the end to wars if everybody

1148
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,720
had the ability to just annihilate each

1149
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,880
other also um

1150
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,240
you know or just like i was saying

1151
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,760
before with the deforestation and the

1152
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,920
droughts and the fires it's just it's um

1153
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,839
it's just really

1154
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:00,880
just one

1155
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,440
yeah so please join us at our booth uh

1156
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
can we take questions is that okay and

1157
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,160
go until we go or

1158
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,799
you tell us

1159
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,839
sure

1160
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,280
just kick us off stage when you guys

1161
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,520
think awesome you guys can hear me

1162
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
um

1163
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,160
so if it was one thing that i came for

1164
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,839
hope it was for this actually you guys

1165
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,880
uh

1166
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,000
this resonated with me um so

1167
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,960
uh my handle serif saroff depends on how

1168
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,920
you wanna

1169
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,680
pronounce it i am my name my real name

1170
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,800
is leo

1171
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,640
but um

1172
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,079
the question will come later really on

1173
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,680
how i can help

1174
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,359
but

1175
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,200
we're all here for a reason i work in

1176
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,599
cyber security my job is to secure

1177
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,599
not today's world it's the future for my

1178
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,599
daughter for our kids everything we do

1179
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,040
today impacts a hundred years from now

1180
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,400
and you pretty much hit the nail on the

1181
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,440
head where

1182
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,680
we have the ability to discover

1183
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,760
future pioneers future discoverers

1184
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,640
future innovators today within children

1185
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,359
right so i work also for a school system

1186
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,760
that focuses uh on kids that are deaf

1187
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,599
blind and on the spectrum

1188
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,760
and for the kids that are deaf

1189
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,280
the sign

1190
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
language is a form of steganography that

1191
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,359
i've discovered they have an ability to

1192
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,280
understand that they have a superpower

1193
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,359
when we instill that in children

1194
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,440
and they instill that beautiful

1195
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,240
experience they go on to be successful

1196
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,319
they go on to understand that

1197
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,560
they started life without a failure

1198
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,119
with success and they may falter but

1199
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,480
it's up to us to ensure that they're

1200
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,440
successful a hundred years from now

1201
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,319
and although i deal in the digital space

1202
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,720
of fighting threats and adversaries and

1203
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,040
many of us do

1204
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,200
it's when we create a world

1205
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,480
that's

1206
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,040
better with more good humans that we

1207
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,640
will potentially influence the

1208
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,880
adversaries to realize and come around

1209
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,760
and say

1210
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,200
maybe you know what i'm done with this

1211
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,720
we got to join this side because there

1212
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
will be more of us so

1213
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,200
this was awesome and

1214
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,400
i'll definitely be downstairs because i

1215
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,520
want to figure out how we can help each

1216
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,359
other

1217
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,079
thank you so much it's you know it um

1218
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,640
i i had the words in my head but i just

1219
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
i can't even because it just it rings so

1220
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,000
true to my heart when we do

1221
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,240
presentations when we do stem programs

1222
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,560
seeing the kids eyes light up it's magic

1223
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,400
to them seeing these sparks seeing these

1224
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,160
things come up and then also being able

1225
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,760
to do the same demonstrations that

1226
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,680
nikola tesla was doing wowing the people

1227
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,960
at the time

1228
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,920
it's such a tool to to reach out and to

1229
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,760
try and you know it gives it silly as it

1230
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,240
sounds gives me hope being here you know

1231
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,160
seeing so many individuals that are just

1232
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,079
right on the money of just

1233
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,319
on the same wavelength you know of you

1234
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,760
know and just like how many people are

1235
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,640
here um attending you know

1236
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,160
just trying to do the right thing in

1237
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,920
this crazy world that we're living in

1238
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,280
where we feel like you know it's an

1239
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
uphill battle and it's

1240
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,599
everything seems so bleak man there's

1241
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,520
still there's definitely hope out there

1242
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,839
and science center hopes to be a beacon

1243
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,400
of that light for all all to the

1244
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,319
betterment of mankind for betterment of

1245
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,480
humankind for betterment of all of us

1246
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,680
you know

1247
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,040
and so thank you so much for sharing

1248
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,720
that

1249
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,839
thank you

1250
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,720
uh tesla poked into a lot of different

1251
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,960
areas some of which we've caught up with

1252
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
and figured out to some degree and

1253
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,839
others we have not as a

1254
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,560
society uh

1255
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,079
that's not to say they're nonsense

1256
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,359
there's a lot of things that he looked

1257
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,960
at that have some merit we just haven't

1258
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,880
caught up to them yet as i'm saying and

1259
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,560
i was discussing this at the booth with

1260
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,240
things like you know you have lightning

1261
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
that neutrons they measure neutrons

1262
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,960
coming out of them which means there's

1263
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,720
nuclear reactors there's exploding wires

1264
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,319
which form a plasma and all kinds of

1265
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,280
weird

1266
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,520
nuclear transmutations occur but what i

1267
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,119
wanted to ask you is are there any do

1268
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,800
you know of which professors

1269
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,960
universities researchers companies

1270
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,760
agencies are looking into some of

1271
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,480
tesla's more far-fetched and advanced

1272
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,359
ideas today to see you know what they

1273
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,880
can do with them

1274
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,640
and who who are they

1275
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,160
yeah so a great question right um first

1276
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,760
i think let's break that down in terms

1277
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,400
of like who are they it's we the people

1278
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
the people in this room and far beyond

1279
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,640
there's many college professors i

1280
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,240
wouldn't be able to name them all that

1281
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,319
continue his legacy and work

1282
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,240
i'll give you a key example that

1283
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,720
continues to

1284
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,040
kind of energize the community in terms

1285
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,520
of physics phenomenon in relationship to

1286
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,280
it which is the

1287
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,480
tesla valve invented in the 1930s or so

1288
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,800
and had no practical use in society

1289
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,559
really for the most part

1290
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,640
and in short it's a stop valve with no

1291
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,640
mechanical moving pieces

1292
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,040
uh it would go on a couple years ago for

1293
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,800
china to utilize in a robotic heart

1294
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,000
transplant so you have researchers and

1295
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,280
doctors that came together to uh

1296
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,960
print that tesla valve create that tesla

1297
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,280
valve and put it inside a robotic car

1298
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,359
uh you have the utilization of that

1299
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,520
technology is just

1300
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,040
i can't prove a negative right there's

1301
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,960
so much more that we can do we just

1302
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,280
don't know and that's part of what we do

1303
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,119
is try to inspire under other

1304
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,880
individuals and say hey this is what's

1305
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,920
going on right what can you do

1306
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,000
because it doesn't have to be just from

1307
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,079
researchers it comes from we the people

1308
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,520
everyone that's in this room from

1309
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,680
practical purposes or whether you it is

1310
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,960
what the uh on september 16th and 17th

1311
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,559
we have the world's largest tesla coil

1312
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,559
it's um done by greg lay who's a

1313
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,280
researcher that is um looking to study

1314
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,079
the phenomenon that's lightning and that

1315
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,079
aspect of it is utilized and studied

1316
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,640
through the conjunction of a tesla coil

1317
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,760
a very very large tesla coil and we'd

1318
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,160
love to be in a spot where we recreate

1319
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,119
one day nikola tesla's 187 foot tower

1320
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,119
and have that coil and continue studying

1321
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,319
that because

1322
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,920
no one's done it so

1323
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,680
are there people out there absolutely

1324
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,599
