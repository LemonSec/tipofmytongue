of horse

65
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,959
may 12th

66
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,519
2017

67

do you remember

68
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,519
yes

69
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
it's the day of cyber attack by varacry

70
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,879
when i cry cause

71
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
tremendous damage

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
or of the world

73
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,080
microsoft has given one answer to learn

74
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,199
somewhere

75
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
if presented by one occli

76
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,080
it's

77
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
literally

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,719
nasa where protection

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
microsoft has added

80
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,919
a ransomware protection feature

81
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
in the windows 10 or greatest update

82
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,000
of the 2017 release

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,280
the new feature helps stop customer from

84
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,440
accessing important files in real time

85
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,560
even if

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,360
num somewhere infects the computer

87
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,360
when the feature enables

88
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,840
it protects

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,479
folder allowing only authorized apps to

90
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
access files

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
the foundation of windows ransomware

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
protection

93
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,600
controlled for the access

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,400
and

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
consists

96
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,680
of

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
protected folders

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,560
and

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
arrow and absolute control for the

100
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
access

101
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,360
note that

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
controlled all the access is disabled by

103
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,840
default

104
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
you need

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,080
administrator privilege to enable it

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080
protected folders are folders that

107
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
protect your files

108
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,359
from being encrypted by nasa where

109
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,880
here you can add the folders you want to

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,360
protect

111
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
however the default projected folders

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
such as documents

113
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,520
or pictures are listed

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,359
even if you don't specify them

115
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
arrow and absolute control folder access

116
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,319
are apps that

117
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
can access protected orders

118
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,479
it says that

119
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,319
apps determined by microsoft as friendly

120
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
are always arrowed

121
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,919
but

122
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,840
they are not listed by default

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
unfortunately

124
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,039
microsoft's nasa may protection is full

125
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,280
of holes

126
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
so many researchers are researching way

127
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,280
to bypass nasa protection

128
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,160
this is the techniques to

129
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,080
exploit the inclusion of office apps in

130
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,319
the white list

131
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,160
and bypass control holder access using

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,319
office ore objects

133
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,960
this is the technique to bypass control

134
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
folder access that

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,879
writing the encrypted data from

136
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,479
memory to a new file

137
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,360
and

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
then using the

139
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
rename code to

140
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,879
replace the original file

141
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
this is a technique to bypass control

142
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,240
holder access that

143
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,199
takes

144
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
advantage of

145
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
the fact that security features are

146
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,599
disabled

147
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,240
when windows starts in safe mode

148
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560
and

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
my research a technique to bypass

150
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,000
control holder access using

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
dll injection

152
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,399
this is

153
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,240
explained in detail

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,440
in

155
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
2018

156
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
when i was researching on ransomware

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
production

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
i found that file explorer has access to

159
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,120
protected orders

160
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
i use

161
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,080
the computer object model hijacked

162
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
to inject a merchant's dna into file

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
explorer

164
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
because com objects are managed

165
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,240
in the registry

166
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
they can be hijacked by

167
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,600
editing the registry

168
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,640
to

169
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,160
reference managers payloads rather than

170
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,839
this

171
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,720
estimate com object

172
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,680
under context many hundreds in include

173
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,040
a list of shell extensions

174
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
used by file explorer

175
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,560
i focus

176
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,519
on the

177
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
on this gu id

178
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,800
in that list

179
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,320
if

180
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
you search

181
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
for this guid in the registry

182
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,880
you will find it under clas id

183
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,680
so

184
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,279
this guid is the series id that

185
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,279
identifies the com object

186
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:30,880
and

187
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,959
the default value for

188
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,760
mproc server 32 is 032.dll

189
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
if you can change

190
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,519
this to myself dll

191
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,399
you can inject in and

192
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,480
inject it into file explorer

193
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
but

194
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
you cannot

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
change this

196
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
directory

197
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
because it's

198
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,959
managed view of its key classic route

199
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
as

200
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
described in msdn

201
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,880
the managed view of hp classes route

202
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,519
displays the money's value

203
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,959
hkey local machine and hd current user

204
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,760
and

205
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,800
if both have value

206
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,320
hkey current user will take

207
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,320
proceedings

208
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,360
in the case of this cls id

209
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
there is a value in hkey local machine

210
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,160
but

211
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,440
not

212
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,600
in hd current user

213
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,399
so

214
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,440
if you add the value to its

215
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,279
hd current user

216
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,720
you can change value of hd classes root

217
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,760
write a command

218
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,519
in a batch file

219
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,000
to add the path of the merciful

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,839
hd current user

221
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
in start file explorer it will load the

222
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,240
malicious dll

223
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,440
the mesh sdn runs on file explorer

224
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,279
process

225
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
so it can encrypt

226
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,200
rotated for our files

227
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,160
this completes the lassomen

228
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,160
poc

229
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,440
of course

230
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,519
i deported this research result to micro

231
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
microsoft

232
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,720
but

233
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,800
they told me that

234
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,480
this is not security vulnerability

235
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,040
for following

236
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,439
reason

237
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,560
resided

238
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
are predicated

239
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,200
of

240
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,480
the attacker having logging access

241
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,839
to the target

242
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,200
account already

243
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,760
since you are only able to write to hkcu

244
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,600
you will not

245
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,160
be able to affect other users

246
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,240
the earth's soul does not appear to be

247
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,160
escalation of privileges

248
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,040
and finally

249
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,360
it

250
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,399
would appear the attacker would not

251
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,680
again

252
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,959
gain

253
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,920
anything

254
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
from this attack

255
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
the attacker would gain nothing from

256
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,199
this attack

257
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,120
so

258
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,399
i have

259
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,680
presented this research at similar

260
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
conference

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,959
this is my

262
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,160
previous

263
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
research

264
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,079
well

265
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
our hopes artists

266
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,959
in

267
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
2021

268
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,040
introduce

269
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
windows 10 national production as

270
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,279
effective in

271
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,680
protecting against ransomware

272
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
i questioned the windows 10 natural

273
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,360
protection is effective

274
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,480
out of this article

275
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
as

276
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,440
i thought my peoc was still valid

277
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,480
and could easily be included

278
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,680
but

279
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,519
just to be sure

280
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,639
i learn my poc on the latest windows

281
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,759
here is a video of the poc

282
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,440
i mentioned earlier learning on windows

283
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
11

284
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,800
here

285
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,800
the image of the antenna is

286
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,439
preserved in the high pictures folder

287
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,000
next

288
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,079
open the lasso protection settings

289
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,079
screen

290
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,320
and

291
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,839
enable contour folder access

292
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,480
plants match files that

293
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
are being successfully encrypted in the

294
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,759
past

295
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,079
the program was blocked

296
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,319
and

297
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
the program

298
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
the ekina is safe

299
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,880
finally a check of the block history

300
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,439
so that

301
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,640
the contour folder access protected this

302
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,520
picture folder from the file explorer

303
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,039
as you can see my previous

304
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,080
ex

305
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,280
exploitation is now no longer valid

306
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
microsoft said

307
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,480
my report is not vulnerability

308
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,280
but

309
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
they had

310
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
secretly fixed it

311
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
i was so trusted

312
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,799
that i decided

313
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,840
if there were any other holes

314
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,720
in the ransomware production

315
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
i checked control folder access registry

316
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,960
and the list was empty for

317
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,080
both

318
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
arrows applications and

319
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
rotated orders

320
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
the

321
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
default protected folders

322
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,400
such as documents and kick charts which

323
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
we discussed

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
in the first section

325
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,799
were not in protected orders

326
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,039
the default preset folder is in another

327
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
registry

328
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,520
and

329
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,919
is in hd current user

330
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,799
this means that folders protected by

331
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,400
default can be

332
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
changed with user privileges

333
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,000
when you actually check

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
the

335
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,600
property of picture folder

336
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,960
it says

337
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
you can change

338
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
a good idea

339
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,120
but a bad idea for microsoft

340
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,000
just

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,679
pops into my head

342
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,640
what happens happens

343
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,840
if you

344
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
if you change the location of picture

345
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,200
folder

346
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,480
before change

347
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
for that

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,960
eyes are protected and

349
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,840
cannot be

350
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,039
encrypted but

351
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,600
by change folder

352
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,159
files in the original folder

353
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,960
are not longer protected

354
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,200
and should be able to be encrypted

355
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,480
i actually try it

356
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,799
a new batch file

357
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,520
this time

358
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,600
reboot the system

359
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,559
after

360
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,158
changing the user folder

361
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,280
this is because the syst

362
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
system needs

363
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,559
a level to

364
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,880
recognize the changes

365
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,679
user folder

366
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,039
but

367
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,559
debuting

368
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,840
takes a long time

369
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,919
and i hate it

370
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,840
i'll go with more

371
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,760
unfortunately max has not rotated the

372
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
ekina

373
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,000
take

374
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,480
the blog history

375
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,960
out before

376
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,360
there's nothing in the block e3

377
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,280
yes

378
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,080
i

379
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,480
outfox microsoft again

380
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
microsoft miss

381
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,799
stimp things like this

382
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,840
well

383
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,720
ah sorry

384
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,960
well don't you want to know my first

385
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,159
the option to this viral tv ipod

386
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
what a surprise

387
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,039
this time

388
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,400
it's just

389
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,679
this one phrase

390
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,240
because control of the access is the

391
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,960
defense in depth security features

392
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,799
we cannot

393
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,240
accept merchants to deal with last

394
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,679
representation issue

395
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,480
we need to inform

396
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,159
many people

397
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,280
about this issue

398
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,600
so i created a poc looks even more

399
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
dangerous

400
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,400
i'm using the

401
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,120
component object model hijacking

402
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,520
method again

403
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,200
or injecting dln into file explorer

404
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,720
actually

405
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,600
component object order hijacking

406
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,159
can specify the network path

407
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,840
in other words

408
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
if you can write

409
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,720
the registry by exploiting

410
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
any vulnerability

411
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,240
you can encrypt the file without sending

412
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,679
vl to the target

413
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,320
i use

414
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,760
the cb 2018

415
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,760
3035

416
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,679
command index i command the injection

417
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,240
viability in this poc

418
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,120
this

419
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,720
this is a viability about apache

420
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
server

421
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,600
now let me show you

422
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,960
the ekina is safe

423
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,000
open the lasso protection

424
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,679
accepting screen

425
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,679
and

426
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,760
enable control folder access

427
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,480
check

428
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
the ip address

429
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
and

430
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,000
use it to execute the tica server

431
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,520
from here

432
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
the attacker

433
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,080
use

434
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,480
a carry to attack

435
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,720
the target

436
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,440
the message deal is on curry

437
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,159
are created as a samba

438
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,880
user using

439
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,840
ebay edit

440
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
and restart

441
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
already complete

442
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,679
i created a shade that

443
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,600
it executes the python scripts

444
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,279
downloaded from

445
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,679
expo

446
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
excluding

447
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,879
its arguments

448
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,919
the argument is a command to be executed

449
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,600
on the target

450
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,039
which is the change and execute

451
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,679
logical time

452
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
unfortunately microsoft could not rotate

453
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,120
the akina

454
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,520
yes

455
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,120
i brilliantly included files remotely

456
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,159
will

457
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,440
microsoft's

458
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,720
secretary fix it again

459
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,840
probably yes

460
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,240
in summary

461
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
as you can see this time

462
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
i could encrypt

463
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
the user data

464
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,919
in a very easy

465
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,640
and very ridiculous

466
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
way

467
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,000
it is so simple that

468
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,880
anyone can easily

469
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
imitate

470
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,720
i imitate it

471
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,640
but please never create rasam area using

472
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,840
this method

473
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,399
i think

474
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,360
backup is the only way

475
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,320
to protect your data from run somewhere

476
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,159
i suggest that you always

477
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,480
have a backup of your data

478
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
okay my presentation is over

479
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,039
thank you

480
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
all right thank you so much soya this is

481
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,919
a chance for anyone to ask any questions

482
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,360
he can't directly you hear your

483
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,120
questions but we can either have you i

484
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
can walk up to the mic we can bring the

485
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,480
mic around if anyone has a question or

486
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,159
you can relate to me and i'll relay it

487
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,320
to him

488
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,720
so the question soy is what was

489
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,880
microsoft's reaction or what was your

490
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,279
reaction back to microsoft from the

491
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
email you received saying it wasn't a

492
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,840
problem

493
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,039
did you hear the question soya

494
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,120

so

497
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,120
microsoft

498
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,439
says
