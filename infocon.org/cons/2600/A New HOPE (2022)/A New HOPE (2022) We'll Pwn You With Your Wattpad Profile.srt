hi

11
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,760
hello everyone

12
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,519
how are you doing

we're

15
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,160
we're approaching the end

16
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,599
unfortunately but it's been fun no

17
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,959
all right so who here uh creates their

18
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
own passwords

19
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,879
no

20
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,959
almost everybody who uses password

21
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,720
manager yes

22
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,959

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,680
so

24
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,560
which is will pound you with your

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,800
wattpad profile by roman hiknew so

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,640
please welcome him and have fun

28
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,330
[Applause]

29
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,798
test

30
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
if you know the enemy and know yourself

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,560
you need not fear the result of a

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
hundred battles

33
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
that's a quote from sun tzu's the art of

34
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
war though of course he probably

35
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
originally wrote it in classical chinese

36
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,239
this is an attitude many of the cyber

37
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,840
security professionals in the audience

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
may be familiar with

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,760
before learning to blue team to defend

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,640
your army or company

41
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,319
you learned a red team

42
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
you practice the techniques black hat

43
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
hackers use for crime in order to better

44
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
defend against those hackers

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
i would argue however that even the

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,839
average internet user

47
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
could benefit from learning the ways of

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,358
their adversaries

49
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,479
you see

50
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
whether you like it or not you're

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
already fighting 100 battles and all at

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,440
once

53
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
and the result of those battles

54
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,759
some guy on a hacking form could drop 12

55
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
gigs of leaked user credentials from

56
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,919
that website you signed up for you know

57
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
that one used it once years ago

58
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
and completely forgot about it

59
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
and hidden in the leak is your old

60
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,199
password and username finally revealed

61
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,840
for the public to see

62
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,880
however

63
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,400
if you know your enemy

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
if you know how and why hackers try to

65
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
get their grimy hands on credential

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,840
grump dumps from insecure websites and

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
what they try to do with them

68
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
you need not fear this result

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
hi my name is roman hoytson neil i'm an

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
undergraduate computer science student

71
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,160
at the university of texas at dallas

72
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,919
an officer for my school's open source

73
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
software club and our cyber security

74
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,720
group and the director of acm research

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,639
which is a

76
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,120
project-based based initiative to give

77
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
undergraduate students computer science

78
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
research experience

79
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
last semester i directed one of the

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,840
projects under the program where we used

81
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
machine learning to guess people's

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
passwords based on the information in

83
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
their wattpad profile

84
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
and in my talk i'd like to tell you

85
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
about the project and more generally

86
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
give you a behind the scenes look into

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,880
password cracking

88
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
you might already know that it's a good

89
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,120
idea to use long complex passwords with

90
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
a mix of symbols and numbers that are

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,360
different for every account

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,039
but have you ever stopped to think about

93
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,319
why

94
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,400
i've found that most resources don't go

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
into detail about what threats you're up

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
against and as a result they don't give

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
you insight into what password security

98
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,840
really means

99
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
by the end of my presentation you have

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
visited the mind of a cyber criminal and

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
gleaned a deeper understanding into why

102
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
you should think about the passwords you

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
choose in the first place how hackers

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
get to them and what you can do to stop

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
them

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
so

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
all right team

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
welcome back to another meeting it's

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
really great to see all of your evil

110
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
faces as you know

111
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,199
h society is looking for more ways to

112
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,600
expand our illegal business that's right

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
we uh we stopped the protests and now we

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
uh we're into black hat crime

115
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,919
um our cryptocurrency rug pulls scams

116
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
are doing well for us so far

117
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,800
uh

118
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,199
but as the recent crypto crashes show

119
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
people are catching on fast and i'm not

120
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
sure how long this revenue stream is

121
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,919
gonna

122
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,199
keep up

123
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,759
that's why i'd like to branch out into

124
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,599
black hat hacking

125
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,759
so hear me out team

126
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,520
uh when someone signs up for an account

127
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
on a website the website somehow needs

128
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
to store their password and a database

129
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
in order to authenticate them the next

130
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
time they sign in

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
i did a bit of research and i learned

132
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
that if the website doesn't store it

133
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,840
safely

134
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
we might be able to swoop in and access

135
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,440
the database to see the passwords of

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
everyone who's made an account on the

137
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,479
site

138
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,960
for example just last year an attacker

139
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,639
gained access to a system used by

140
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,880
godaddy to provision their managed

141
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
wordpress pages

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
and in short this allowed them to see in

143
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
plain text

144
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,599
the credentials of 1.2 million users

145
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,720
now

146
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
i know what you're thinking

147
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
how exactly are we going to make money

148
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
using a bunch of suckers account

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
credentials

150
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
well because so many of them tend to

151
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
reuse the same password across their

152
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
online accounts

153
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
66 percent according to a recent survey

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
once we have on our hands on one of

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
their passwords we can try our luck by

156
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,479
using it to sign into other services

157
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,000
apparently this is called credential

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,639
stuffing i guess the idea is we take

159
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,319
known credentials from a breach of one

160
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,280
site and stuff them into other sites

161
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
for example say julia used the password

162
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,720
kittens and guns 123 for her wordpress

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
server

164
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
so maybe we can log into our online bank

165
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,319
account with the same credentials and

166
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,720
drain it

167
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
but the problem is that this only works

168
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
a 10th of the percent of the time on

169
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,279
average but with automated scripts that

170
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
try the leaked password username

171
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,080
password combinations across many

172
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
different sites we can turn millions of

173
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,120
guesses into thousands of results which

174
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
is pretty good right

175
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,360
but

176
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
right now

177
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
we aren't exactly a skilled enough team

178
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
to hack into account databases by

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,880
ourselves

180
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
so instead plenty of more experienced

181
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
hackers have already done the work for

182
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,480
us

183
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,399
they gather the data into a convenient

184
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,160
package which we can buy online with

185
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
that cryptocurrency we've been pulling

186
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
and yeah that's right if you can believe

187
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
it there was a time where mainstream

188
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
crypto users weren't just day traders

189
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,399
they actually used it for useful things

190
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,600
like

191
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
buying drugs and stolen credentials

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,080
online

193
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
even hackers have to specialize to

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
survive in this economy

195
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
um

196
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,399
so

197
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
here's the plan right we buy leaked user

198
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,279
credentials uh we use them to commit

199
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,440
fraud and identity theft and

200
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
make alpha some cash

201
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
but this is all under the assumption

202
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,839
that we can go straight from acquiring a

203
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
credential dump to exploiting it

204
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,440
but the truth is passwords play hard to

205
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
get

206
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
unfortunately

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,519
many organizations nowadays hash the

208
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,760
passwords in their database

209
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
annoying right

210
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,160
uh

211
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,839
and this allows them to authenticate

212
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,360
people without even having to know what

213
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
their passwords are so how are they able

214
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
to do this

215
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
well a cryptographic hash function is an

216
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,680
algorithm that takes some data as input

217
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
like a password and maps it to a hash

218
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
value as output

219
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
the defining feature is that outputs

220
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,680
should be effectively unique

221
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,839
no two inputs should map to the same

222
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,440
output

223
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
this means for example if you know the

224
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,839
hashes of two files are the same

225
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,160
you can

226
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
you know by definition that the files

227
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,920
are the same also the same they're

228
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,560
duplicates

229
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,640
however in

230
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,199
practice

231
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,839
in practice

232
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,000
you

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
they're only finite possible hash values

234
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
if they're a fixed length but there's

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,320
infinitely pos infinitely many possible

236
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
uh strings or files of arbitrary length

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
and so

238
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
via a

239
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
theorem called the pigeonhole principle

240
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,399
you

241
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
by definition you can't like compress

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,399
files into

243
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
you know a finite number of hashes and

244
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,600
so it's guaranteed that there's at least

245
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
well there's infinitely many files that

246
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
have the same hash

247
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
but in real implementations of good

248
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,800
hashing algorithms this is so absurdly

249
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
rare that it's effectively impossible

250
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,079
for example the

251
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,519
sha256 hash function you'd have to

252
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,480
calculate

253
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
two to the 128 different hashes to have

254
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
a 50 chance of encountering at least one

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,279
collision

256
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,920
um but the global network and the global

257
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
network of bitcoin miners

258
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,800
uh

259
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
currently performs 212 quintillion shaw

260
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,959
256 operations per second so how long do

261
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,480
you think it's going to take for us to

262
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
find a collision right anyone want to

263
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,880
guess

264
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,120
yeah

265
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
it's hard to guess right but at that

266
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,200
rate it would take them more than 50

267
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,240
billion years to reach this number

268
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
and that's just any hash collision uh

269
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
the reason why it's two to the 128

270
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,800
instead of two to the 255 which is the

271
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,680
half of the number of combinations of

272
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
hashes is because of something called

273
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
the

274
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,440
birthday paradox

275
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,079
or in this case it's a birthday attack

276
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,839
and

277
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,040
that just means that if you're not

278
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,000
finding a specific hash you're just

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
finding any two hashes that

280
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,000
are the same from different files

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
you only need two of the half the number

282
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,240
so if you had a specific file or a

283
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
specific password and you tried to find

284
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
a hash collision

285
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,519
it would take two two to the uh 255

286
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,240
combinations which is so absurdly

287
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
like bigger than that even

288
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,880
so

289
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,680
that

290
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
inputs uniquely map to hash values means

291
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,720
that websites don't have to store users

292
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
passwords they just need to store the

293
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
hashes of passwords so when someone logs

294
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,480
in they run the entered password through

295
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
the hash function and compare the result

296
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,800
to the hash value they have on file

297
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,040
instead of the password itself and if it

298
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,360
matches then you know they enter the

299
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
right password

300
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,200
so that's the first feature right

301
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
the second defining feature is what

302
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
differentiates cryptographic hashing

303
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
from just hashing

304
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,320
and

305
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,680
that is that

306
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,320
cryptographic hashing is like a one-way

307
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,920
function

308
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,959
so there shouldn't be any way to glean

309
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,680
what the input is for a given hash value

310
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,279
there shouldn't be any way to like

311
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,480
reverse the algorithm

312
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,639
unlike cryptographic hash functions you

313
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
can sort of reverse the output of an

314
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,959
encryption algorithm

315
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,600
only if you know the key though

316
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,519
cryptographic hash functions don't have

317
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,639
a key in this regard

318
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,519
so

319
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,920
unfortunately for us this means

320
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,720
most databases we might get a hold of

321
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,519
are

322
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,000
databases with password hashes not the

323
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,560
passwords themselves and so we can't

324
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,680
easily

325
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
reverse the hashes to get the passwords

326
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,120
to

327
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,800
you know use to make the money

328
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
but there are ways to get past this

329
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,760
if we run thousands of guesses through

330
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
the same hashing algorithm that the

331
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,480
vulnerable site used we can compare the

332
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
hashes of the guesses to the hashes in

333
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,040
the data leak and this is called

334
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,680
password cracking

335
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
we're not directly reversing the one-way

336
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
function we're just passing a bunch of

337
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
guesses through

338
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,680
and normally if you tried to do this

339
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,399
live on like a live website

340
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
it wouldn't work because they'd lock you

341
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,639
out after so many times but if you

342
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,720
already have the database downloaded you

343
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
can just

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
perform trillions and trillions of

345
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,880
operations on your own computer

346
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,959
the most naive way to make these guesses

347
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
is with brute force

348
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,079
you compare the hash of aab

349
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,920
then or aaa and then aab then aac and

350
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
then so on um but this only works for

351
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,240
shorter passwords i think once you get

352
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
past like

353
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,839
10 characters it becomes computationally

354
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,040
infeasible

355
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
for any average cracker or even eight

356
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,600
characters i

357
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
it changes per year with moore's law

358
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,160
and

359
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,199
programs like

360
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,120
can do this with

361
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,959
millions and millions and millions you

362
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,079
know every second

363
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,519
but to go further right because most

364
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
passwords are not this short and some

365
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
websites a lot of websites even

366
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
restrict you from having passwords that

367
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
are even this short we have to be a

368
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,279
little clever

369
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
so that's where dictionary attacks come

370
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,800
in

371
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
dictionary attacks make use of the fact

372
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,360
that humans don't choose passwords

373
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
composed of equally random letters well

374
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,440
most of us anyway

375
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
humans are predictable especially at a

376
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
large scale they choose common memorable

377
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,399
words and phrases like their favorite

378
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,800
sports team or their lover's name or

379
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,279
their pet's name

380
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,720
and as you can see by far the most

381
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
common passwords are

382
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,000
uh

383
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
you know password123 password one two

384
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
three four five six seven eight nine

385
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,519
now a tiny minority of people actually

386
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,120
do use these passwords even if they're

387
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,600
the most common um something like less

388
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
than one percent of people actually do

389
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
use one two three four five six as their

390
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,079
password

391
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,880
uh but again with millions of guesses we

392
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
can get thousands of results

393
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,920
and

394
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,199
in our case uh

395
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,880
after we've gone through all the brute

396
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,920
force

397
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,880
um

398
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,040
combinations of like eight characters we

399
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
can start going through the list of the

400
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,000
most common passwords overall

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,279
um

402
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,599
so yeah what what's next after we've you

403
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,799
know used the rock u data set which is a

404
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
data set with just millions and millions

405
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
of the most common passwords

406
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,039
once we've

407
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,480
ran through that i mean it takes a few

408
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,319
seconds

409
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,039
we can go even further by combining

410
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,439
common words we create new guesses from

411
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,119
scratch ones that aren't included in

412
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,240
previous

413
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,640
data sets so it's at the point now where

414
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
you can basically just take

415
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
the entire english dictionary for

416
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,320
example

417
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
and

418
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,480
create every combination of two or three

419
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,720
words with numbers

420
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,320
uh and you run through that maybe that

421
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,679
takes a few minutes

422
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,840
and

423
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,679
so then you go through and you change

424
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,640
all those to lead speak

425
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
that's a technique that

426
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,679
people use when they think they're being

427
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,440
clever when they're making a password is

428
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,160
they replace an e with a three or an s

429
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
with a dollar sign

430
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
you go through and do all that okay that

431
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
maybe makes takes like another two

432
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,840
seconds or five minutes or whatever

433
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
and

434
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
even works for

435
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
tricks that

436
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
seem like they should be resistant

437
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
against this kind of attack

438
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,360
one technique that i've heard is

439
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,559
and let me know if you've ever heard of

440
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,960
this too is you think of a really common

441
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
phrase

442
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
like

443
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
or a phrase that's memorable like oh i'm

444
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
standing in front of uh the hope 2022

445
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
conference and then you take the first

446
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,720
letter of each word in that phrase and

447
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
maybe you change some of them to lead

448
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,919
speak and

449
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,440
the result is something that's easy to

450
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,960
remember but it looks random right it

451
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
because it looks like a jumbled mess of

452
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
letters because you don't know what the

453
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,000
underlying phrase is

454
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
uh and so people you know they they wipe

455
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,520
the sweat off their forehead and they

456
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,120
say great i'm resisting against these

457
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,039
kind of attacks but they're really not

458
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,960
because nowadays what password crackers

459
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
are doing is they take the list of like

460
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
the 240 million most common phrases in

461
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,799
the english language and then they take

462
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,200
the first letter of each

463
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
word in the sentence and they do exactly

464
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,880
that

465
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,240
and then they crack

466
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,520
a few more

467
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,480
100 passwords or so

468
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,720
so

469
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,160
[Music]

470
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
choosing a secure password is

471
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,320
harder than it seems at first and most

472
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,160
people don't really

473
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,880
know how to do it

474
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,320
let's see

475
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,360
now

476
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
at this point we've had a lot of success

477
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
breaking into people's accounts by

478
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
cracking their hashes and stuffing

479
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
credentials from previous leaks

480
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
but all hacking groups have to diversify

481
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,039
or else they risk falling behind so are

482
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
there any other ways we can exploit

483
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
people's weak password choices

484
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
well there is one way

485
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
we can go after those particularly

486
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,200
important accounts like those from

487
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
celebrities or influencers by trying to

488
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
guess their password in particular but

489
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,679
if we can't find their password in a

490
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
previous leak or they use a different

491
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,600
password than the one that was leaked

492
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,159
for a different account

493
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,520
it means we'll have to make a blind

494
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
guess

495
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,400
i want to see some hands can anyone

496
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
guess what donald trump's twitter

497
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
password was in october of 2020

498
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,360
password yeah

499
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,918
what about you

500
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
oh yeah

501
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,480
anyone that doesn't know it

502
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,840
right

503
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,120
that one's pretty close

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
right yeah

505
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,039
so

506
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,520
uh the dutch hacker the dutch hacker

507
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,440
victor govers claimed to have

508
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
successfully logged into trump's twitter

509
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,440
account by guessing the password maga

510
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,960
2020 exclamation mark

511
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
i believe the dutch authorities tried to

512
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
arrest him for this uh but because it

513
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,799
was he used responsible disclosure

514
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,120
didn't actually get into any trouble

515
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,799
um and it illustrates the fact that

516
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,880
people use familiar information to make

517
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
more memorable passwords

518
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,559
so

519
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,159
if you know more information about

520
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,159
someone like

521
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
this person's political slogan

522
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
it might be easier to try to guess their

523
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,480
password

524
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
now most people don't have a

525
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
presidential slogan

526
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
but they do have the names of their pets

527
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
or their loved ones or perhaps their

528
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
favorite baseball team

529
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,600
and so

530
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
we can use open source intelligence

531
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
gathering to

532
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,320
find out this information you can

533
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,039
imagine going around to some of the most

534
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,480
popular celebrities uh

535
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
lady gaga um

536
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
barack obama i don't know

537
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,640
and doing the same process and coming up

538
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,720
with a massive list

539
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,080
you might only get around 100 tries per

540
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
account and so

541
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
and you might have to do it

542
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
and you'll have to do all this manually

543
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,039
right you'll have to put your brain to

544
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,919
work

545
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,080
trying to guess their password so this

546
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
doesn't really scale well

547
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,039
and again

548
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,039
we live in a competitive economy you got

549
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,720
to specialize and you got to scale

550
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,440
so in this case i got together some of

551
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,799
my smartest researchers and we tried to

552
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,679
automate this process

553
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
um

554
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,360
what if

555
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
so

556
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,879
has anyone heard of gpt3

557
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
cool yeah glad to hear it

558
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,520
uh

559
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
basically it's a

560
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,000
massive text transformer um which is

561
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
just a neural network model that tries

562
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
to

563
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,000
guess the next word in a

564
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,840
series of words or in the next token

565
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,960
technically

566
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
so it's just a really fancy text

567
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,919
prediction model like the one on your

568
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,600
mobile keyboard

569
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,080
uh but it's like massive it has billions

570
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
of parameters took

571
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,000
i believe like that millions of dollars

572
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
to train

573
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
the training day they use was basically

574
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
like

575
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,799
the text of every website that was

576
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,760
linked to on reddit ever

577
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,320
ridiculous and there are more

578
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,480
there are bigger and more advanced

579
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,440
models nowadays this came out a couple

580
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,640
years ago

581
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,760
but it is by far the most famous one

582
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,720
and

583
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,320
it's closed source

584
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,159
which kind of goes against

585
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
open ai which is the company that made

586
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,159
it

587
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,679
but it's accessible via a public api

588
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,760
and one of the api parameters is a

589
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
refining api

590
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
they've already trained it on millions

591
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
and millions of well okay maybe

592
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,279
trillions of tokens

593
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,840
so you can sort of tap into this

594
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,600
intelligence that it already has but if

595
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
you want to use it for a more specific

596
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,799
use case

597
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
you can send it more examples of what

598
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,840
you want it to generate

599
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,520
in our case

600
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,120
enter wattpad so this is a website

601
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
where people could

602
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,799
write stories

603
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,120
and

604
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,039
i believe it was 2018 they had a massive

605
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,600
data breach it was like 500 million

606
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,919
users credentials were leaked

607
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,440
and the special one about

608
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,000
the special

609
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,960
attribute of this leak in particular is

610
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
that it not only can take people's

611
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,200
usernames and their passwords

612
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,039
but also contain their email addresses

613
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,960
their twitter username

614
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,600
their status their bio i believe their

615
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,760
phone number

616
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,600
a lot of stuff

617
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,279
it did not include their stories

618
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,080
unfortunately um well maybe fortunately

619
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,200
for me because i had to go through the

620
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,240
data set

621
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,679
but

622
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,960
it

623
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,840
but yeah

624
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,320
um these passwords were also hashed uh

625
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,880
with the bcrypt algorithm which is

626
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
not very trivial to

627
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,840
uh go to crack

628
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,480
but fortunately we obtain the plaintext

629
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
passwords through this website called

630
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,559
hashmob

631
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
so we had

632
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,880
our data set which is

633
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,360
millions of people's passwords as well

634
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,840
as their personal information

635
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
and what we did is we fed all this

636
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,559
information to gpt 3 via the api to

637
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,919
refine our instance of their model

638
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,080
so you can see here you have to craft

639
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
the prompt

640
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,679
because it doesn't

641
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,799
by nature have an input output

642
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,640
kind of structure you have to turn it

643
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,200
into a

644
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,559
string of text that will protect the

645
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,080
next word

646
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,919
in this case

647
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,679
you see someone

648
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,080
this is jane doe

649
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,640
and uh they

650
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,279
let's see i forgot by now they work at

651
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,480
goldman sachs some other things

652
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,799
and we refined our model

653
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,600
by

654
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,279
showing it a ton of these examples

655
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,159
to

656
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,120
and the idea was in 10 000 to be precise

657
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,559
the idea was if we showed it enough

658
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,039
examples it might start to

659
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,360
learn to pick out specifically

660
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
how to guess someone's password based on

661
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
this

662
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,240
info of theirs

663
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
the idea was okay maybe this is such a

664
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,240
big model it might pick up on new

665
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,559
nuances like if they mention their pet's

666
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,039
name it's much more likely that that

667
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,480
word is going to be in their password as

668
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
opposed to

669
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,600
some other random word like the word the

670
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
that comes up in the description

671
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,360
and the results

672
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,320
it

673
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,000
even though we only trained with ten

674
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,679
thousand examples which is a tiny

675
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
fraction of the data that was available

676
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
to us

677
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,039
and we used the

678
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,200
uh smallest possible instance of the

679
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
model that we could the least advanced

680
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,799
model because

681
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,080
we are not a professional team we're

682
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
just a bunch of undergraduates we had

683
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,279
like 20 bucks in funding

684
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,640
um

685
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,799
we produced password guesses that were

686
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,120
three times as accurate as a brute force

687
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,159
method

688
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
and this is actually in fact

689
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,120
with only i believe

690
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,960
three guesses allowed but the top 100 or

691
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,679
no

692
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,159
10 passwords allowed

693
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,960
but the brute force like choosing from

694
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,200
the list of most common passwords like

695
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,240
someone

696
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,080
you over there you mentioned you guessed

697
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,640
trump's password was password

698
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,159
that's an example of going through the

699
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
most common passwords to try to guess

700
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,159
someone's account

701
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,840
but maga2020 is an example of

702
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,960
a targeted password guess

703
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,799
um let's see we also did some similarity

704
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,039
analysis uh

705
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,960
so the orange

706
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,720
hump is the

707
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,840
graph

708
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,440
of the similarity between

709
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,840
a guess that we made using

710
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,279
the most common passwords data set

711
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,919
and the actual person's password

712
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,520
and that hump peaks around 0.5

713
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,399
and has a small tail end

714
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,880
and the blue hump is our model

715
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,279
now if you're particularly astute you

716
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,760
might notice that our model peaks a bit

717
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,159
before the orange one

718
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,240
and

719
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,559
this should be interpreted as our model

720
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,879
is worse on average it has a

721
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,799
less similarity to the real password

722
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,039
but that's because the data points in

723
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,520
this graph pick from out of the guesses

724
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,159
i could make what was the most similar

725
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,039
and

726
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,679
for the orange the top 100 passwords we

727
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,200
could choose from 100 and pick the most

728
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,399
similar but for the blue our model you

729
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,559
could choose from

730
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,960
i believe it was 10.

731
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,279
but if you do notice on the very tail

732
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,880
end

733
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,039
all the way on the right

734
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,760
the blue one has a larger spike than the

735
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
orange one

736
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,520
so and that that's the side that really

737
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,279
matters right it doesn't actually matter

738
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,480
how similar our guess is

739
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,240
um

740
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,840
because if it's just one letter off it's

741
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
not gonna it's gonna have a completely

742
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,640
different hash it's not gonna work

743
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
and so it's this end that really matters

744
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,120
and you can see our blue hump just the

745
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,799
last final stretch goes back up so

746
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,399
even though

747
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,039
we only had 10 guesses instead of 100

748
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,960
it was more accurate on the tail end

749
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,320
let's see what else did i have

750
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,120
all right the next session the next

751
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,200
section is how you could defend against

752
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,279
these attacks

753
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,159
so

754
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,679
i'm going to

755
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,240
exit out of h society mode

756
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,520
now

757
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,679
you might have already gleaned how you

758
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,640
can

759
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
defend against password cracking just by

760
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
learning a bit about

761
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,559
how passwords are correct how passwords

762
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,399
are guessed

763
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,440
you might have already guessed that you

764
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,919
should use long complex passwords

765
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,240
that have a lot of entropy

766
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
and that you shouldn't use personal

767
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,158
information in your passwords

768
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,399
you'll note that our most vulnerable

769
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,720
vulnerable victims were the ones who

770
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,799
reused passwords across accounts because

771
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,120
we could do credential stuffing

772
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
and they're also ones that used shorter

773
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,399
passwords and passwords that were

774
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,520
contained that contained

775
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,840
common

776
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,799
words so the actual strategy for how

777
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,120
you're supposed to

778
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,039
defend against these attacks

779
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,399
is

780
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,840
first of all as you might have guessed

781
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
you've got to use a password manager

782
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,480
it is literally impossible

783
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,360
to

784
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
remember all the

785
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,519
passwords that you have uh can i get a

786
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,440
show of hands how many

787
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
or can i

788
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
how many passwords do you think you have

789
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
how many accounts do you think you have

790
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,000
does anyone want to say

791
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,320
300 right

792
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,679
200

793
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,880
yeah that sounds about right at least

794
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,519
for this crowd

795
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,720
yeah me too

796
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,399
exactly

797
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,320
right

798
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,639
and so

799
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,919
yeah it's completely reasonable that

800
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,440
people that don't know about this will

801
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,360
use the same password across everything

802
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,559
because it's

803
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,080
it's unreasonable to expect that they'd

804
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,279
remember

805
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,120
different ones and especially ones that

806
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,279
are complex enough

807
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,320
uh

808
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,039
so

809
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,039
i recommend so what a password manager

810
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,840
does is it stores all your passwords in

811
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,880
one database

812
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
that's hashed of course

813
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,559
and stored securely

814
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,840
and you can have like a browser

815
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
extension for example that fills in your

816
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,399
credentials automatically and it also

817
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,279
lets you generate these long complex

818
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,240
strings to automatically fill in

819
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,640
when you're signing up for a site

820
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,159
so you don't have to even think of the

821
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,559
passwords yourself

822
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,760
this is

823
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,799
the only way in my opinion to

824
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,399
have a reasonable

825
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,440
digital life and still

826
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
have secure passwords

827
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
and at first it might feel kind of

828
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,559
uneasy

829
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,000
because it's sort of like putting all of

830
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,880
your eggs in one basket

831
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,159
but

832
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,000
if you don't use this method you're

833
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,080
essentially putting

834
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,480
spreading all of your eggs across

835
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,559
many different baskets and all the

836
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,799
different baskets

837
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,880
you don't really know how safe they are

838
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
you know how strong their handles are

839
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,120
oh and if one egg cracks all the eggs

840
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
crack

841
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,679
and

842
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,519
instead with a password manager it's

843
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,600
basically like one really strong basket

844
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,480
with like a steel handle

845
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,760
i recommend

846
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,840
bit warden as like a cloud-based

847
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
password manager that sync across

848
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,200
devices

849
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,399
but if you don't want to keep your

850
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,840
passwords in the cloud because it's just

851
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,399
someone else's computer

852
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,720
you can use keepassxc to

853
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,480
another open source password manager

854
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,799
that you store on your own computer

855
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,440
however there are some critical

856
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,360
passwords that you should memorize just

857
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,600
to be safe when it would be difficult to

858
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,000
paste them from your password manager

859
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,760
like the ones to your bank account or

860
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,159
your laptop or your email or your pgp

861
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,159
cree or even your bitcoin wallet

862
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,120
these ones are either

863
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
you know you can't really paste into

864
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,600
your

865
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,559
laptop's field when you're signing in

866
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,600
and

867
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,039
maybe some of these are so important you

868
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,720
want to back up

869
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,679
so you should memorize them anyway

870
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,239
in that case i recommend looking into

871
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,239
diceware hence the image

872
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,399
diceware is a method for generating

873
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,359
passwords where you have a big list of

874
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,399
words

875
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,440
and next to each word is a

876
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,839
a number in cenary or no that's right

877
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,639
and base seven

878
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,040
which is just each of the digits are

879
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,159
from one to six

880
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,280
and

881
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,399
to pick a word from the list you roll in

882
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,719
this case five dice and it gives you a

883
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,560
neat unique number

884
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,679
and you go down the list of words in the

885
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,199
list

886
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,839
and you pick out the word that the

887
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:48,960
numbers

888
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,040
on the dice correspond to

889
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,879
and that's your random word

890
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,918
and you repeat this however many times

891
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,760
depending on how secure you want your

892
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,400
password to be

893
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,920
at first it might

894
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,680
can anyone think of a problem with this

895
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,839
approach for generating a passwords just

896
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,200
a series of

897
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,879
random words picked from a list

898
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,160
too long

899
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,520
yeah that's a good problem um

900
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,599
the first problem actually i'm going to

901
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,200
get to that later but the problem i had

902
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,280
in mind was

903
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,359
you could imagine you could do the same

904
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,240
brute force approach with diceware

905
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
if you know the word list that someone

906
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,560
used you can try to

907
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
brute force all the possible

908
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,720
combinations of words they chose

909
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,879
just like the brute force method earlier

910
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,000
but the difference is that you can have

911
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,720
a

912
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,240
predictably

913
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
a password that has a predictable amount

914
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,800
of entropy which is

915
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,920
essentially

916
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,599
the number of combinations that you

917
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,760
could have picked your password from out

918
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,280
of all the possible combinations your

919
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,440
password could be

920
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,800
if you have a 8 character password that

921
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,320
each has

922
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,920
a lowercase letter that's

923
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,720
26 to the eight possible combinations

924
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
and you get the bits of entropy you take

925
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,480
the log of log base 2 of that

926
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,400
with diceware you can also just like

927
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,920
this you can also have a predictable on

928
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,079
a amount of entropy which says how long

929
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,839
it would take to crack your password if

930
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,280
you have all the information available

931
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,839
to you

932
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,599
um and

933
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,880
for example

934
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,560
i'm completely comfortable saying in

935
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,800
front of a crowd and online that i use

936
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,720
passwords that have eight character

937
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,320
eight words in them from the eff

938
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,200
short

939
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,960
diceware word list

940
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,920
and i'm comfortable saying that because

941
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
each of those passwords has

942
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,599
80 character 80 bits of entropy so

943
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,839
it's picked from a list of two to the 80

944
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,520
possible combinations and that has about

945
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,119
the same amount of security as a 13

946
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,960
character password with

947
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
random letters

948
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,720
numbers and symbols

949
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,320
which normally would be impossible to

950
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,440
remember

951
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,520
but my passwords are just a series of

952
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,800
eight words

953
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
and so i can just make a sentence that

954
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
strings them together

955
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,079
to

956
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,720
remember easily

957
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,160
as you can imagine as you mentioned

958
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,680
earlier

959
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,040
this might not fit in all password

960
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,720
fields and

961
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
the solution is actually the dice where

962
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,960
list that i mentioned

963
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,640
that one in particular you'd have to

964
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,280
roll four dice instead of five

965
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,040
so it's a shorter list

966
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,480
but

967
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,240
each of the words has a unique three

968
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,079
character prefix

969
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,440
the first three letters of each word are

970
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,480
different

971
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,320
and so

972
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,599
once you've memorized the words you

973
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,760
don't actually have to type in

974
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
all of the

975
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,280
letters in each word you can just type

976
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,640
out the first three and it has the same

977
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,920
amount of entropy it's the same number

978
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,240
of combinations

979
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,400
in that case it's around 28 characters

980
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,640
which still doesn't fit into

981
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,280
as many password fields but

982
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,400
you can

983
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,240
lower the amount of

984
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,359
entropy

985
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,040
based on your threat model

986
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,000
to account for that

987
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,520
let's see if there's anything else i was

988
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,839
going to get to

989
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,599
yeah

990
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,000
that's actually about it

991
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,320
if you

992
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,599
by knowing a bit about how hackers crack

993
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,880
passwords you can more easily

994
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,200
defend against those hackers by

995
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,520
choosing passwords that you know are

996
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,839
not vulnerable to those attacks

997
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,000
thank you

998
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,839
and now i'm open to questions

999
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,960
that's right there's a microphone over

1000
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,400
here

1001
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,599
but i wouldn't mind if you yelled

1002
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,359
oh that's right

1003
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
and we're all wearing black t-shirts

1004
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,400
well congratulations roman

1005
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,079
uh

1006
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,320
first a second year undergrad project

1007
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
you know pretty cool methodology thank

1008
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,400
you and you get to present a hope

1009
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,160
um so if i understand this correctly

1010
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,240
you're you're kind of using ocean to

1011
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,680
help inform the attacker

1012
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,240
with a more specific sort of sniper

1013
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,200
input right that's right um so in in

1014
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,839
your proof of concept did you was the

1015
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,480
olsen gathering manual

1016
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,839
or was it automated process

1017
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,880
um

1018
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,960
the actual automation of our process

1019
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,720
would be an extension to our research

1020
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,520
okay all we did is create the model and

1021
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,599
we actually made a

1022
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,440
web app to demonstrate it i might

1023
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,640
actually be able to pull that up i

1024
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,480
actually forgot about that

1025
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,960
where you can put in any info you want

1026
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,720
and it guesses the password based on

1027
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,599
that

1028
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,760
so

1029
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,520
we can take

1030
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,720
any of the data points from our

1031
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
wattpad data set

1032
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,119
but in practice

1033
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,400
you know maybe you would write a web

1034
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,920
scraper to find all this information

1035
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,599
automatically

1036
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,040
okay that's great and

1037
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,960
does your research team have any future

1038
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,800
plans to extend

1039
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,960
this work

1040
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,760
um this is an ant i forgot to me to

1041
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,920
mention actually

1042
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,040
this is overtly against the

1043
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,880
terms of service for the gpd3 api

1044
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,400
um it explicitly says you

1045
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
cannot try to guess information about

1046
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,240
someone based on their public

1047
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,160
information which is kind of exactly

1048
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,920
what we're doing

1049
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,319
so if they catch us after this talk

1050
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,400
maybe we won't have a future extension

1051
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,200
for this research

1052
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
right now i don't think we're actually

1053
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,079
planning an extension um

1054
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,440
like i said the

1055
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
acm research program i'm directing next

1056
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
semester and

1057
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,480
in the past we've had teams across

1058
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
semesters

1059
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,560
extend previous research so if that's

1060
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,960
something any of the leads are

1061
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,119
wanting to do this semester

1062
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,560
they might do it but i don't believe

1063
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,960
they are

1064
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,839
does that answer your question cool

1065
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,960
hi

1066
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,880
hello thank you for your

1067
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
talk i'm interested in

1068
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,640
utilizing things like natural language

1069
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,760
processing etc to

1070
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,640
better be able to predict passwords

1071
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,200
do you have any well have you or do you

1072
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
have any future plans

1073
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,640
to

1074
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,680
compare results of this

1075
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,919
process that you've created with the

1076
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,839
other

1077
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,240
password guessing processes and software

1078
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,920
such as cool for example that's c-e-w-l

1079
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,800
if

1080
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,680
folks in the audience aren't familiar

1081
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,440
that's a good question

1082
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,160
in our preliminary research

1083
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,040
i did not come across cool but i did

1084
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,359
come across a paper that

1085
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,760
also had the scope of automated targeted

1086
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,280
password guessing

1087
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,800
and they took distinct pieces of

1088
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,079
information

1089
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
such as people's email addresses and

1090
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,839
their phone numbers

1091
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,480
and created a like a specifically

1092
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,599
engineered pipeline to

1093
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,480
take

1094
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,359
sections of those pieces of data

1095
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,560
and

1096
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,760
use machine learning to figure out which

1097
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,560
where each of those combinations goes

1098
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,760
for example

1099
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,839
the model might have learned that often

1100
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,680
when people have a birthday in their in

1101
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,119
their password

1102
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,079
they put it at the end

1103
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,119
the motivation behind our research was

1104
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,200
we wanted to

1105
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,599
just let the knowledge of gpt3 figure

1106
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,920
all that stuff out by itself

1107
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,720
and

1108
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,880
learn to draw inferences like people use

1109
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,000
birthdays in their password

1110
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,200
i had not actually heard about cool do

1111
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,599
you think you could expand on what

1112
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,040
how that works

1113
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,280
uh of course i've i've only used it i'm

1114
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,839
not a contributor to cool but for those

1115
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,319
that aren't familiar the general premise

1116
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,640
is that the tool is pointed at a url at

1117
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,480
which point it will

1118
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,400
uh pull down the

1119
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,200
text within how many of

1120
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,440
and it is recursive as well so it will

1121
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,319
follow links on the page on the page

1122
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,280
that

1123
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,440
you pass as a parameter

1124
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,599
and it will generate word lists based

1125
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,319
off of the text in the url and the urls

1126
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,480
that are associated with it

1127
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,920
is that to guess a specific user's

1128
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
password

1129
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,480
it can be used to create a word list

1130
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,880
which can be oh i see

1131
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,839
either

1132
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,720
used in fuzzing or in tools such as hash

1133
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,800
code or john the ripper

1134
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,920
right now we don't have any plans to

1135
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,560
keep going with this research but

1136
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
if i was if i was interested in picking

1137
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,480
this up again that would be a great

1138
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,359
extension to compare it to

1139
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,520
other methods

1140
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,359
we only ended up having enough time

1141
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,280
during the semester to compare it to the

1142
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,040
brute force method

1143
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,319
but

1144
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,319
yeah that would be a good idea to answer

1145
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,000
your question yes it does thank you for

1146
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,200
your time thank you so much

1147
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,520
all right all right

1148
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
really great talk um i was curious so

1149
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,359
you're working with some user data it's

1150
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,400
been a while since i've done anything

1151
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,760
like that did you speak to any kind of

1152
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,280
institutional review board or anything

1153
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,400
like that

1154
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,920
it's a good question

1155
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,880
um

1156
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,480
we did think about the

1157
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,400
ethics of our research i mean did you

1158
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,599
you said you broke the terms of service

1159
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,440
so

1160
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
man i didn't know i'd be put on the spot

1161
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,400
i mean

1162
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
you're presenting research yeah i know

1163
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,839
to be clear i also think it's good but

1164
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,520
i'm going to ask you hard questions yes

1165
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,440
thank you

1166
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,760
our program isn't

1167
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
it has it's not officially related to

1168
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,319
the university it's not a research

1169
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,960
program that's a part of

1170
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,599
university of texas at dallas

1171
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,920
we do have we did have an advisor from

1172
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,680
ut dallas and it's part of a

1173
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,359
our school has a

1174
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,520
local chapter of the association for

1175
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,240
computing machinery called acm

1176
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,359
and that chapter has a

1177
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,920
program called acm research

1178
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,800
and so

1179
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,119
because it's one layer separated i kind

1180
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,640
of had free reign to do whatever i

1181
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,520
wanted

1182
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,680
and

1183
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,920
there is no institutional review board

1184
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,440
we figured that this

1185
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,760
research was ethical um

1186
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,200
because

1187
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,440
all this is

1188
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,960
i don't want to say trivial but it's

1189
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,480
it's pretty straightforward stuff we

1190
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,000
didn't have to actually get our hands

1191
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,680
deep with the real machine learning part

1192
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,440
we just use the api

1193
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,560
and so

1194
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,839
i believe

1195
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,960
this kind of thing probably has been

1196
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,520
done before but it's done behind closed

1197
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,680
doors and it's not out in the open where

1198
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,119
i can tell a bunch of people that i did

1199
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,599
it and we can update our security

1200
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,640
protocols to cover this um

1201
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,400
can i answer your question

1202
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
uh yes is it okay if i ask you one other

1203
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,640
one yeah go ahead um

1204
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,440
this is not as aggressive um so um are

1205
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,280
you aware of any points that people

1206
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,520
using this uh from using some of these

1207
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,880
techniques for more of a threat hunting

1208
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,400
perspective so for example you've got

1209
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,160
somebody who's off on the dark web

1210
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,839
they're an annoying little

1211
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,760
we have either their password or the

1212
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,839
hash of their password and then going

1213
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,520
off you know to some threat center or

1214
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,200
something in microsoft google et cetera

1215
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,280
sort of see if we can find you know dumb

1216
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,119
 mcdonaldson you know was off on the

1217
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,119
dark web off on the clear web link to

1218
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,240
accounts together kind of thing

1219
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,240
i don't quite understand your question

1220
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,839
i'm sorry i'm i'm phrasing this poorly

1221
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,680
like because you're talking about okay

1222
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,960
you're talking about credential stuffing

1223
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,560
i was wondering if you've also used that

1224
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,760
not just

1225
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,599
maybe if you have some

1226
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,040
i'm not even sure if this is possible is

1227
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,400
what i'm asking is like instead of

1228
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,240
trying to go and log into some service

1229
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,839
and steal somebody's credentials with

1230
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,760
this information instead just try and

1231
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,359
see if you can link accounts together

1232
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,200
from more of a you know you've got this

1233
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,359
threat actor like this hypothetical you

1234
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,880
know person and trying to link an

1235
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,480
account together rather than

1236
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,000
oh and then

1237
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,800
never mind i'm phrasing this poorly no i

1238
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,559
i believe i understand what you're

1239
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,680
proposing

1240
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,480
uh the de-animization of

1241
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,240
someone sued in him online yeah and then

1242
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,839
maybe using like for example if they had

1243
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,839
this password on off somewhere and we've

1244
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,079
got this suspect or whatever um that

1245
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,440
then you can do this munching that

1246
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,760
you're talking about in a similar manner

1247
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,280
like you might not be a

1248
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,119
forensic match but you could go like

1249
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,160
this guy

1250
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,000
was off on the dark web and his password

1251
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,160
was like torchwood one two three four

1252
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
six and we sort of munged that a bit and

1253
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,400
we found somebody else using a similar

1254
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,000
one off on the clear web maybe these two

1255
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,160
accounts are linked kind of thing

1256
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,079
that's a good idea i definitely think

1257
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,680
you could do something like that

1258
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,240
i've heard some very

1259
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,720
some people are very paranoid about

1260
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,400
uh well not paranoid

1261
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,680
that are really concerned about internet

1262
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,920
privacy that have started discussing the

1263
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,319
use of natural language processing

1264
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,680
uh to

1265
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,520
actually do exactly that to link

1266
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,160
someone's real persona with for example

1267
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,520
the text and

1268
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,240
pseudonymous blog post or blog site that

1269
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,200
they have

1270
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,800
and so the proposed solution to that was

1271
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,119
using some sort of model to

1272
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,800
like to automatically reword

1273
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,040
what they wrote in order to

1274
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,760
prevent a natural language model from

1275
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,040
automatically

1276
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,640
learning their mannerisms and learning

1277
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,040
their style of writing to connect or

1278
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,800
even the content they use to connect

1279
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,240
their pseudonym to their real life

1280
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,240
profile

1281
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,960
but yeah that's a good idea

1282
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,960
hey

1283
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,000
yeah impressive research so for

1284
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,240
such a small project i'm just wondering

1285
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,400
so you said that you do

1286
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,319
you allowed up to 10 matches to see if

1287
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,079
you can guess it with your model right

1288
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,119
that's right

1289
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,200
have you done any analysis on what the

1290
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
complexity of the passwords are that you

1291
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,599
don't guess so how

1292
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,200
complex let's say in number of words or

1293
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,760
entropy that you don't guess where that

1294
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,520
barrier is because that would be

1295
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,559
interesting not just so for the

1296
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,559
not so smart people that sort of guess

1297
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,160
passwords that you know

1298
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,400
these kinds of complexities are sort of

1299
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,880
guessable and these are

1300
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,400
probably not guessable if you're looking

1301
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,880
at the threat model pro of an online

1302
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,280
attack

1303
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,599
that's a good question if i understand

1304
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,359
correctly

1305
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,240
you're asking for an analysis of

1306
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,160
how our model

1307
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,000
deals with

1308
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,920
entropy in general the idea being yeah

1309
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,880
just if you if you can if you can get

1310
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,200
and if you looked at a measure of

1311
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,760
entropy to see where is the very sort of

1312
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,640
the

1313
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,520
barrier in terms of entropy of where we

1314
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,119
cannot guess the password anymore

1315
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,160
i see we did not do any analysis on that

1316
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,480
um but again that would be another good

1317
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,200
extension and should write these down

1318
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,160
uh

1319
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,200
i'd

1320
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,680
i'd imagine that

1321
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,000
our model is able to guess passwords

1322
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,240
that at first glance have more entropy

1323
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,119
than

1324
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,400
if you had no information about the

1325
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,440
target

1326
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,119
because that's kind of essentially what

1327
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,400
you're doing is you're bringing more

1328
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,079
information to reduce the amount of

1329
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,240
entropy

1330
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,400
in a not so clear way

1331
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,160
i have a question

1332
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,760
go ahead of course the golden question

1333
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,520
have you tried to

1334
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,730
bitcoin wallets

1335
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,359
[Music]

1336
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,920
you know the bitcoin wallets or

1337
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,960
the the mnemonic 12 words that could

1338
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,359
create a bitcoin wallet have you guys

1339
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,760
looked into that

1340
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,920
you said the mnemonic 12 words that make

1341
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,680
up you know

1342
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,520
a regular person creates a wallet they

1343
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,440
provide them with 12 words and a bitcoin

1344
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,319
wallet

1345
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,839
that creates the private

1346
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,480
key our case our model would

1347
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,240
not be able to do anything

1348
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,559
about that in fact like i was talking

1349
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,640
about earlier that's essentially what

1350
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,079
diceware uses

1351
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,400
um

1352
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,599
the only reason our model would

1353
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,040
be able to be more effective than a

1354
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,640
brute force approach was which is what

1355
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,000
you would use for

1356
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,760
your bitcoin wallet is because

1357
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,280
the human

1358
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,359
created the password and in theory

1359
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,359
we have some more information that helps

1360
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,240
us

1361
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,440
get in their mind and

1362
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,559
learn what

1363
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,839
sort of strings they could have used to

1364
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,520
create the password so in this case

1365
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,720
because a human didn't choose the

1366
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,880
password there's nothing we can do

1367
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,319
because it was provided by the

1368
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,760
randomized

1369
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,720
program

1370
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,118
that's right

1371
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,200
after all

1372
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,520
right

1373
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,200
um

1374
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,480
i'm gonna

1375
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,000
i have like two minutes i'm gonna pull

1376
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,960
up the web demo for our project

1377
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,359
let's see

1378
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,000
oh

1379
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,720
oh my god my search results are there

1380
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,880
there it is

1381
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,839
so there's nothing there

1382
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,160
now it might actually take a while to

1383
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,640
load but

1384
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,440
oh

1385
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,000
don't tell anyone

1386
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
oh there it is

1387
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,640
so in our case we have everyone's

1388
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,280
this person's info and in theory you

1389
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,319
could

1390
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,319
put in any info you want even your own

1391
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,280
which you shouldn't

1392
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,559
this is that guess my password docker

1393
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,520
record app.com

1394
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,480
and

1395
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,000
i believe it takes a minute for this app

1396
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,160
to spin up so i might actually not have

1397
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,280
enough time to show the oh there it is

1398
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,119
yeah in our case it guesses

1399
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,880
jane 23 jane one two three

1400
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,319
ninety nights i don't know what that

1401
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,558
means

1402
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,839
you can guess as many as you want

1403
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,200
all right i'm out of time thank you so

1404
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,290
much

1405
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,940
[Applause]

1406
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:13,429
