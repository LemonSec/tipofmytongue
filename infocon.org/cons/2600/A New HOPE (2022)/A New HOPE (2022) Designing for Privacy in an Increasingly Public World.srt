and he's going to do a talk about

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
designing for privacy in an increasingly

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
public world thank you

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,000
thank you very much

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
uh yes my name's robert strible i guess

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
a little bit about myself

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,760
i'm a ux designer uh or designer broadly

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
been working in new york city for the

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
last 16 or 17 years but about 20 years

43
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
in the business of digital design

44
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,400
i work for publicist group other names

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
razor razor fish you may be familiar

46
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,840
with and the group i work with right now

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
we're so top secret we don't even have a

48
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,720
public name but work for publicist

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
mainly doing design

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
in the last few years i've become

51
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,239
increasingly interested in the issue of

52
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
privacy as it applies specifically to

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
design and so that's what i'm here to

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,239
talk about today

55
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
so what do we mean when we talk about

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
designing for privacy then

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,840
um

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
this is an issue that's growing in fact

59
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
when i pitched this for hope you know it

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
was a passion of mine i feel like since

61
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
the last month

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,519
this subject has become even more

63
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
important in ways that we'll talk about

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,239
given the current events um but as

65
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
designers and i i would include all of

66
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
us as designers i think you can use the

67
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
term of course for a very specific role

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
like i have but if you're building

69
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
anything at all there is an eye to

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
design you're thinking about experiences

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
and how people interact with them and

72
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
many of us work with companies or

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
organizations or maybe you even are

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
building an app yourself so it kind of

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
applies to all of us these days but

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,519
companies especially have to consider

77
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,920
the privacy of their users data

78
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
increasingly and also their browsing

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
behavior

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,640
for their clients benefit and safety now

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,560
obviously they have some very selfish

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,319
reasons for doing that right they do it

83
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,799
for their own personal and financial

84
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
self-interest and we'll talk more about

85
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
using that as leveraging to get them to

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
do the right thing a little bit later

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
but it is increasingly important that

88
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,040
they consider privacy and security

89
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,799
issues affecting uh their digital

90
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
experiences so how do we though as

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
designers designing these experiences

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,199
whether they're apps websites whatever

93
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,839
they are to how do we keep an eye to

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,079
people's privacy

95
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,759
i think this audience knows the

96
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
difference between privacy and security

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,919
i'll touch on that really briefly

98
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,240
because the things do overlapped privacy

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
of course is your ability to control

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,479
your personal information at its

101
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,280
simplest right and the security is that

102
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
organization how secure do they keep

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
your data that's a very simple way of

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
explaining it however these concepts do

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
often overlap so i'll probably refer to

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
them both largely our focus though is

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,840
designing experiences so the emphasis is

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
upon privacy

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
so

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,479
why privacy

111
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,320
i think everyone here is probably

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
familiar with edwards no

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,039
i think he said this about as succinctly

114
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,880
as it can be said

115
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,479
arguing that you don't care about the

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,479
right to privacy because you have

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,720
nothing to hide is no different than

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
saying you don't care about free speech

119
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
because you have nothing to say

120
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
and for a lot of people free speech may

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
not be that big of a deal either but i

122
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,320
think increasingly we're aware of why

123
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
privacy

124
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
is a big deal it's maybe something we've

125
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
been out of rest on our laurels and

126
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
think i've got nothing to hide but

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
increasingly we see reasons

128
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,600
not to think of it as hiding but to

129
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
think of it as protecting things that

130
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
the public does not necessarily need to

131
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,840
know so even if we're not personally

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
concerned about privacy we you know we

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,479
talk about user centered design the user

134
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,680
is not me right the user is not you who

135
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
is doing the designing we are thinking

136
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
about the people who are using this

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
particular design and if you're familiar

138
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,800
with user

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
centered design usability increasingly

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,680
we talk a lot about empathy that the way

141
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
we can build the good experiences design

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
good experiences is to have empathy for

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,759
other people

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,080
but we really can't do that if we're not

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
talking to people looking at their

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
experiences thinking about their

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
different backgrounds and another field

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
that is increasingly uh something that

149
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
we're paying attention to thankfully is

150
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,759
the idea of inclusive design and if

151
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,720
we're going to design uh inclusively

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
then we also will want to think about

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,759
privacy issues i think and we'll want to

154
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
talk to get to know people with

155
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
different backgrounds and perspectives

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
and importantly have them on our own

157
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
teams right

158
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,720
so for an example

159
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,039
this is a relatively small non-profit

160
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
day one here in new york city that we've

161
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,280
gone to work with a little bit in the

162
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,680
past on a pro bono basis

163
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
and they are an organization that works

164
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,599
with young people who are often in

165
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,680
abusive relationships now they don't

166
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
necessarily recognize that they're in an

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
abusive relationship sometimes and what

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,199
the the organization can do is help them

169
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,199
to see those moments

170
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,520
where something is actually intrusive or

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
abusive and that often is from a privacy

172
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
perspective in other words if your

173
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
partner is demanding to know your

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,319
passwords to your phone or different

175
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,199
websites and putting a guilt trip on you

176
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,919
and saying uh if you really love me you

177
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,319
wouldn't mind sharing your password with

178
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,720
me recognizing that that's actually

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
abusive behavior right

180
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
so even when we're helping them with

181
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,840
their website in different

182
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
considerations we want to

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
keep that audience in mind and

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
understand even something so simple that

185
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
if someone is reviewing the content on

186
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,360
this website they may want to exit it

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
very quickly if someone comes along and

188
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
is looking over their shoulder so we

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,360
built an exit button for example on the

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
site for them to to get out of there

191
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,080
um similarly though lgbtq youth they may

192
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,479
have a need for privacy they they very

193
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
much do have a need for privacy

194
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,240
and they will want to feel secure if

195
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
they're reaching out to people now i'll

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,479
use facebook as an example here because

197
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,120
it is a very popular platform for people

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
to communicate on and the average person

199
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,039
the average kid

200
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
this may be the first place or one of

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
the first places they think to go to to

202
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,360
look for help so if they're going to an

203
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,440
organization like audrey lord

204
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,639
on facebook can they be sure that their

205
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
activity is

206
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,199
private is somebody watching them is the

207
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,319
fact that they like the audrey lord page

208
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,599
visible to other people or uh you know

209
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,200
any other non-profit that they might be

210
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,360
interacting with or magazine or

211
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
something like that that suits their

212
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
preferences as we'll see

213
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
it is not necessarily private

214
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
so

215
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
what are some different privacy issues

216
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
i'm sure that you're familiar with a lot

217
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
of these but i think it's interesting

218
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
just to touch on different ones to get

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
us thinking about how these things are

220
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
and how they're growing all the time

221
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
data security an issue

222
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
from a security perspective

223
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,120
in the wall street journal 2019 said

224
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
that security experts

225
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
believe that we will break through uh

226
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,480
quantum computers will help break

227
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
through encryption within a decade and

228
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,560
so all our passwords potentially come

229
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
useless uh what does that mean to all

230
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,399
have personal information our personal

231
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,240
data of course people are working on

232
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
solutions people talk about biometrics

233
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
as a solution is that a solution from a

234
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
privacy perspective there's a lot of

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,200
things to be considered right

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
uh

237
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
more personally perhaps last year

238
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,160
in april

239
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
we learned that facebook of course the

240
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
largest social media platform on the

241
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,279
planet was hacked

242
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,800
half a billion people's data was leaked

243
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,240
and that included things like phone

244
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
numbers and personal data

245
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
and you can imagine that this sort of

246
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
information if it doesn't allow someone

247
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,399
to steal your identity immediately it

248
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,360
can be a base for certainly approaching

249
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
that for forgetting stealing your

250
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
identity or using it in all sorts of

251
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
nefarious ways

252
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
in fact

253
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,800
during the pandemic

254
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,279
uh identity theft has taken off and it

255
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,959
may or may not be a surprise to you i

256
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,880
was a victim of it early last year

257
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,959
myself it was one of the worst things

258
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,800
i've been in spent hours and hours on

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
phone with the bank dozens of calls they

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
told me i stole my money at one point

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,839
and eventually figured it all out it was

262
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,959
awful

263
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,760
but the ftc said there were 1.4 million

264
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,480
reports of identity theft in 2020 which

265
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
is double from the year before

266
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
so uh identity theft thieves even

267
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,440
margaret uh uh targeted the government

268
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,000
funds that were earmarked to help people

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,839
uh who are hit financially by the

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
pandemic you probably heard

271
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
tell that of course there are also big

272
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
corporations that took advantage of this

273
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
situation too but leaks of this kind of

274
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,079
personal data can really be catastrophic

275
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,760
and as some of you may know it can take

276
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
a long time to recover from these sort

277
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,399
of incidents

278
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,720
facial recognition many of you may be

279
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
familiar with clearview

280
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
clearview um scraped uh public sites

281
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,440
images instagram social media and got

282
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,399
three billion photos of people that they

283
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,959
were able to then use to build facial

284
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
recognition models for people without

285
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,240
their permission

286
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,839
the idea of course is that if you put

287
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,680
your photos on instagram or facebook or

288
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
twitter or whatever that you're giving

289
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,000
permission um but when you put your

290
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
photos out there you may not realize of

291
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,839
course that an organization like

292
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,880
clearview could be creating a

293
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,399
facial recognition program which they

294
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,399
then sell the results of to law

295
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
enforcement and

296
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,519
indeed that is what they were doing

297
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,600
similarly you may have heard tell of

298
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
stores like albertsons rite aid macy's

299
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,279
ace hardware etc uh using facial

300
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
recognition programs to identify

301
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
customers you might think oh is that

302
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,639
theft protection no

303
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,320
actually sometimes they are not willing

304
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,079
to tell the public why they are

305
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,240
utilizing these programs but we do know

306
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
that they're actually using the to track

307
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,880
customers around the store in order to

308
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,600
present them with ads online later so

309
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
it's not just your browsing habits on

310
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,959
the web that might bring that

311
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,720
that advertisement on instagram or

312
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
facebook for the shorts that you're

313
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,279
looking at

314
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
deep fakes

315
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
i like to touch on deep fakes because

316
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
they can have a personal privacy issue

317
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,760
of course and i previously had used the

318
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,560
example of the barack obama video but

319
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
when the war in ukraine broke out people

320
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,639
immediately began to warn there are

321
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
going to be deep fakes and indeed they

322
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,720
were both of putin and zelensky now i

323
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,160
think they were probably pretty

324
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,200
amateurish but they did uh they were put

325
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
out there nonetheless to create you know

326
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
confusion and misinformation and whatnot

327
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,839
but these can also be used to undermine

328
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
people's privacy of course and when you

329
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
put your video when you put your imagery

330
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
out there who knows how it might be used

331
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,279
in the future

332
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
you might also know that uh

333
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,680
people doing the very same thing with

334
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,720
voice as well uh so

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
the hacker for example or i shouldn't

336
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,800
say hacker the person who stole my money

337
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,920
from the bank uh did try to imitate me

338
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,480
but they couldn't imitate my voice yet

339
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,639
uh that may happen in the near future

340
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
dark patterns early discussion i did

341
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,839
here

342
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,680
mention dark patterns and i was grateful

343
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,959
for that and i want to go into more

344
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,279
detail about dark patterns too these are

345
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,880
very very common once you see them

346
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,120
you'll see them everywhere a great

347
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
example recently the new york times

348
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
covered was

349
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,399
donald trump

350
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,800
the trump campaign creating what they

351
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
called a money bomb literally referred

352
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
to this design as a money bomb

353
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
where if you were to sign up for a

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,199
donation you didn't realize it but it

355
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
was a recurring donation so i'll show

356
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,199
you on the next slide

357
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,480
this check box here was pre-selected

358
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
yellow background

359
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,360
different kinds of you know font size

360
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
uh caps whatever and they kept changing

361
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,279
the wording and everything and it was

362
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,160
intentionally done to make you uh to

363
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,720
trick you into a recurring payment so

364
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
this made a lot of trump supporters

365
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,880
actually very angry

366
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,959
but this again was done intentionally a

367
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,320
great example of a dark pattern uh their

368
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
donations did grow astronomically but so

369
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,519
did fraud complaints

370
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,959
a loss of privacy in early to 2021

371
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
delivery drivers were required to sign

372
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,639
consent forms which allowed amazon to

373
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,079
collect their biometric data you've

374
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,600
probably heard of this too

375
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
so all sorts of monitoring of their

376
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,079
behavior on the job which did include

377
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,839
which did prompt one person at least to

378
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,240
quit data sharing so this is where of

379
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
course i allude to the developments in

380
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,320
the last month or so as roe v wade was

381
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
overturned as soon as this got into the

382
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,199
news there was a lot of talk about uh

383
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,560
you better delete particular apps but

384
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,720
even more importantly there is the

385
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,639
already discussion that deleting apps

386
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,959
isn't enough because your browsing

387
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,600
behavior is seen and shared amongst

388
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
companies and if you trust one company

389
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
with your information

390
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
but they have partners that they share

391
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
it with do you trust those partners as

392
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
well so your data

393
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
isn't just held by that one particular

394
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
company it can be looked at by a lot of

395
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,279
different people

396
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,480
and indeed this actually isn't a new

397
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,759
issue you go back here to 2019

398
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,560
and this story about missouri reviewing

399
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,440
data about planned parenthood's patients

400
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,000
including their periods to identify

401
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,160
failed abortions so this was basically

402
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
the government the state government

403
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,399
sending people in and demanding to

404
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,680
review data at that time

405
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
but of course in a post row usa we're

406
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
already seeing how data can be used

407
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
against us and that article on the left

408
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
is just confirming

409
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,519
after

410
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,160
what was already happening that this

411
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
location data broker admitted that they

412
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
had excess data

413
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
for planned parenthood clinics

414
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
in order to understand these sort of

415
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,440
things

416
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,759
and planned parenthood discovered that

417
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
they had marketing trackers for facebook

418
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,560
on some of their pages and immediately

419
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
removed those and there are other

420
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
stories in the news more recently of

421
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,880
studies of the i think it was the top

422
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,440
100 hospitals in the united states and

423
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,680
they found that 30 percent of them had

424
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
social media trackers like

425
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
facebook on their websites and that

426
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,920
meant that if you were filling out a

427
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,320
form on a particular page facebook was

428
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
getting pinged with some of that

429
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,199
information as well

430
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,240
further

431
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,560
looked at some of those hospitals and

432
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,800
found i think it was seven

433
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,199
that there were logged in

434
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,279
portals where that information was being

435
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,079
shared with facebook now this could be

436
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
disappearing uh it may have no eyes on

437
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,120
it but again we don't know right we

438
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
don't know who's looking at that we

439
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,360
don't know what other partners are also

440
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,280
on the receiving end of that information

441
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
so um we talk a lot about

442
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
personalization in my field and we kind

443
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,480
of talk about it as a value people seem

444
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
to like personalization a lot when you

445
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,880
ask them uh outright in paul's they'll

446
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,319
say that they do appreciate

447
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,679
personalization

448
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,000
but when you ask them the questions that

449
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,919
reveal how personalization actually

450
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
works it's a very different story so

451
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,160
when they when you ask them from the

452
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,480
perspective of do you mind being

453
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
followed around the internet to have

454
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
these uh ads personalized for you it

455
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,440
becomes a very different story so a 2019

456
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,000
survey for example by rsa found that

457
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
only 17 of respondents thought it was

458
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
ethical 17

459
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,679
thought it was ethical to track their

460
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,360
online activity

461
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
and earlier pew research found 91

462
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,280
percent of adults believe consumers have

463
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,760
lost control of how their personal

464
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
information is collected and used by

465
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
companies

466
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
in a sign of a time uh you're probably

467
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,600
aware of this or have noticed it at

468
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,919
least apple rolled out this new iphone

469
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,960
feature uh app tracking transparency uh

470
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,520
it's an anti-tracking shield you say you

471
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,600
opt in or out of being

472
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,480
tracked

473
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,320
by this particular app

474
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
and they have to ask first so it's been

475
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,240
hugely popular so far uh initially uh i

476
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
think the number was even lower than 20

477
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,240
percent but the last figure i could find

478
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
is about 20 percent of ios users

479
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
allowing apps to track them i'm sure

480
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
that varies according to the type of app

481
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,080
that you're talking about so they've

482
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
been a little bit more

483
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,880
fine-tuning to that and people are more

484
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,039
likely to allow the app to track them in

485
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,960
certain situations but what you're

486
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
seeing on the right there is instagram

487
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
basically trying to sell you on this and

488
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
they don't want to go into too much

489
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,919
detail obviously or take up too much of

490
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
your time but they're giving some

491
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
bullets there that say

492
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
that they can personalize ads for you

493
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,840
better that it will keep instagram free

494
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,679
and that you'll be supporting businesses

495
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,840
and you know you can take each of those

496
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,600
bullets for what they're worth but

497
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,039
that's what they're trying to do they're

498
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,440
trying to make sure that you click uh

499
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
allow on that next screen because a lot

500
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,120
of people are not

501
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
and then of course there's the oncoming

502
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,240
cookie apocalypse google's plan to

503
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,799
update the chrome browser by 2023 which

504
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,720
would prevent uh companies from tracking

505
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,280
your wanderings i think most people

506
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
would understand that this does not

507
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,600
completely prevent a company from

508
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
learning about you they have plenty of

509
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
ways that they can do that um but this

510
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
is going to be an unpopular move with a

511
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,360
lot of companies of course a lot of this

512
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,320
is really a reaction to competition

513
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
amongst companies like apple google and

514
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,600
facebook

515
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
but it is also a result of the fact that

516
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,400
people are increasingly concerned with

517
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,760
the privacy of their data

518
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
so we just kind of looked really quickly

519
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
at some top privacy concerns uh there

520
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
are some good articles out there or

521
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,600
studies about

522
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
this one i

523
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,679
refer to the 2019 smashing magazine one

524
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,240
where they talk about 24 top user

525
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,400
privacy concerns and there's a lot more

526
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,320
there that i think we can all identify

527
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
with whether it's things like the hidden

528
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
fees or social profiling

529
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
automatically importing contact

530
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
information of your friends that's a

531
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,640
pretty common one unfortunately and also

532
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,919
a dark pattern uh we'll show an example

533
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,520
perhaps of that in a moment where you

534
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
know you actually accidentally end up

535
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,840
sending information to dozens or

536
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,159
hundreds of your friends due to a dark

537
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,840
pattern

538
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,080
there are some regulations uh some of

539
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,240
which you've probably heard of at least

540
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
the gdpr of course a general data

541
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,480
protection regulation that will help

542
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
with some of this

543
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,480
it was finalized in 2016 came into

544
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
effect in 2018 and that does regulate

545
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
how absent sites can collect this sort

546
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,760
of information at least within the eu

547
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,919
but also um what happens to that data

548
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,840
when it's transferred outside of the eu

549
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,679
so if you remember uh

550
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,760
three or so years ago when you've got

551
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
dozens and dozens of emails at once

552
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
we've updated our privacy policy that's

553
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,000
what this was a result of at the time

554
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,799
so some things that gdpr requires it it

555
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,760
requires that people opt in to sharing

556
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
their data works a little differently in

557
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
the united states so far as we'll see in

558
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,799
a minute so you have to opt in you have

559
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,799
to communicate to people in the moment

560
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,240
when you're collecting their personal

561
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
data still something that we don't see

562
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,679
enough of here and you have to be

563
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,280
transparent about what you're doing with

564
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
it and you have to allow people to

565
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,320
download and delete their data as well

566
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,000
similarly in the united states we do

567
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
have things like the california consumer

568
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,919
privacy act

569
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,120
our own gdpr so far if you will

570
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,280
very similar but there is an interesting

571
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
difference as i alluded to and that is

572
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,400
that you have to opt out of having your

573
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
data shared which definitely seems like

574
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,600
the very american way of doing things as

575
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
opposed to the gdpr is that businesses

576
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,320
by default can

577
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,760
collect your information and you have to

578
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
explicitly say please do not do this

579
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,919
in march of 2021 california also

580
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,440
announced that they are banning dark

581
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
patterns we'll look again at dark

582
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,360
patterns in a little bit more detail in

583
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
a moment it'll be very interesting to

584
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,240
see how they codify and identify dark

585
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
patterns because some of them are very

586
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
slippery but there are some obvious ones

587
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
and in some of the more recent articles

588
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,039
they have talked about how they will

589
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,480
address that

590
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
they also developed a new privacy

591
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
options icon which could be good but i

592
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
haven't really seen it released in the

593
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,520
wild yet

594
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
that was designed by the folks at

595
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
carnegie mellon and university of

596
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,760
michigan the idea for that is that it

597
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,120
would appear on the page somewhere and

598
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
draw your attention to it that aha

599
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
here's where i can go to read this and

600
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,679
maybe take care of privacy issues

601
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,240
so since new york maryland massachusetts

602
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
and hawaii at least are all working on

603
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,919
developing their own privacy laws as

604
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,480
well and we have to kind of be designing

605
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,760
with gdpr and california in mind we may

606
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,159
as well sort of design for the highest

607
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,400
common good right and assume that things

608
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
will continue to change with more

609
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
emphasis upon privacy and security in

610
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,400
the future

611
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
but i said we're probably all designers

612
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,159
and i often do address designers ux

613
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,200
designers for this sort of presentation

614
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,960
what is our role in where does the

615
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
rubber really meet the road

616
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
might be familiar with mike montero he

617
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
wrote a book

618
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
or more of an extended rant maybe ruined

619
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
by design it's a very entertaining read

620
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,440
he said we're not hired to get approval

621
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,120
or to have your work pinned to the

622
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,360
company fridge people hire you to be the

623
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
expert so you may as well be the expert

624
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
now i know working with a lot of younger

625
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,159
designers it can take a while to develop

626
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:46,880
the

627
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,600
confidence maybe to address things uh

628
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
with your company uh with your manager

629
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,360
with whomever it is um but one of the

630
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,760
things i hope to do in this presentation

631
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
is tackle some talking points around

632
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,240
that

633
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,840
so specifically i think it's good to

634
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
think of the fact that we as designers

635
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,400
do have a responsibility to advocate for

636
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,799
users especially if we call ourselves

637
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,960
user-centered designers

638
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,919
but that term user i try to avoid using

639
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
as much as i used to because it does

640
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
tend to strip people of their individual

641
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
characteristics right their personality

642
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,360
their history their unique needs even

643
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,559
their lives

644
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,760
we have to think of it as a

645
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,480
responsibility to real human beings and

646
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,320
we might even need to push back where

647
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,159
necessary in terms of our clients

648
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,760
understand

649
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,640
um

650
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,440
what

651
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
are some ways that we can do that oops

652
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,240
sorry

653
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
uh we can talk to them first of all this

654
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
is the most highfalutin way maybe is

655
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
talk to them about their need for civic

656
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,760
responsibility and that's again

657
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
reminding them hey i'm a user-centered

658
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
designer i'm thinking of users i want

659
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
this site to be good for them

660
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,520
so we want to encourage them to think of

661
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,679
these end users as human beings who are

662
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,360
part of their community

663
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
but there's also reputation management

664
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,559
right

665
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,880
we may need to remind our clients

666
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
that what they do can undermine their

667
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,080
brands

668
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,400
we can let them know that dark patterns

669
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,679
that we'll look at again in a few

670
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,559
minutes can anger people and can also

671
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,559
cause them to abandon your site can also

672
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,000
contribute to undermining your

673
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
reputation

674
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
we can remind them that data breaches

675
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,440
and sloppy treatment of data can

676
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,520
lead to loss of their base

677
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
and of course there's that financial

678
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,440
consideration increasingly as we have

679
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
more laws and regulations about this

680
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,880
kind of thing

681
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,559
uh basically we need to tell them that

682
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,919
yes you might think that there's an

683
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,080
upfront cost to designing for privacy

684
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
and security but the long-term task

685
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
costs can be devastating and this

686
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,080
conversation applies increasingly in

687
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,240
related fields like accessibility as

688
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,279
well uh where when we point out issues

689
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,080
around

690
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
accessibility on websites we might get

691
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,640
pushback oh that's going to take time

692
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
well the investment up front uh is going

693
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,600
to be worth it because you are helping

694
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
people

695
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,799
but you're also not going to get sued

696
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,880
potentially

697
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
anybody familiar with this gentleman

698
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
renee carmill

699
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
this is a dramatic example the most

700
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
dramatic example that i've ever found of

701
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,320
somebody who had to make a decision

702
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,679
around privacy this was in the 1940s

703
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,600
but he and his team

704
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,679
they worked on the french census they

705
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,559
were

706
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,360
called the first ethical hackers

707
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,840
and they decided to sabotage their

708
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,279
machines

709
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,760
to prevent them from recording peop

710
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,000
individual people's religion

711
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
and of course that was because

712
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,480
they were then able to hide the fact

713
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
that some people were jewish now the

714
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
nazis did discover that they were doing

715
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,279
this they were arrested they were

716
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,559
tortured and carmill died at dachau

717
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,559
but they did prevent

718
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
some tens of thousands of people

719
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
potentially living in france uh from

720
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,720
being identified and thereby save their

721
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
lives so what is amazing to me about

722
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,480
that story is it is from the 1940s but

723
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,600
this is a story about people

724
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,799
adjusting an experience and you know an

725
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
early digital one if you will too in

726
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
order to do something good they were

727
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
resisting if you will and they were

728
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,159
standing up for the privacy of these

729
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,080
particular people so that's a very

730
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,320
dramatic example we may think we don't

731
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,000
ever we're not likely to ever have

732
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,760
anything happen like that

733
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,360
but more recently uh in 2019 maybe not

734
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,399
as dramatic but certainly uh was a big

735
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,559
deal for these people five employees

736
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,880
quit their jobs at github after learning

737
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,200
that that company had shared data with

738
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,960
ice and of course immigration and

739
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,640
customs enforcement if you're familiar

740
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
with them

741
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,240
they have done a lot of things that are

742
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,600
argue questionable at best involving uh

743
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,480
immigration uh in immigrants and uh

744
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,320
actually potentially

745
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,559
breaking uh human rights

746
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,559
creating human rights violations as well

747
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,640
so this must have been a very big deal

748
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,600
for them in particular

749
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
what are some best practices though

750
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
those are sort of the dramatic examples

751
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
uh what are some actual best practices

752
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,240
let's look at those for how we can work

753
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,000
on a day-to-day basis with some of these

754
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,279
situations

755
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,600
dr ann kavukian she has what i could

756
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,200
call a manifesto the privacy by design

757
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
manifesto if you will and she lays out

758
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
some foundational principles on that

759
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
it's worth having a look at it's

760
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
available as a pdf online you can

761
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,919
probably read it in five minutes but she

762
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,240
recommends making privacy the default

763
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,880
setting in our designs and she says that

764
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
privacy should be embedded in design so

765
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
when you hear that phrase privacy by

766
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,039
design a lot of time that's where this

767
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,799
is coming from but what are some

768
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,600
practical ways to do that

769
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
first of all avoid dark patterns and i

770
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
mentioned this one first because it does

771
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,320
cover a lot of territory and i'll give

772
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,039
you some practical examples um dark

773
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,880
patterns that is a term that was coined

774
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
by harry brignel

775
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,279
in 2010 he has a website i think it's

776
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,159
literally darkpatents.org.com

777
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
and he identified about 12 different

778
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
types of dark patterns it'll be

779
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,320
interesting to see if more of those are

780
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,799
articulated especially if california's

781
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,320
trying to codify this i don't think

782
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,279
they're just pointing to his website

783
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,600
but these basically trick people dark

784
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,200
patterns trick people into doing

785
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,679
something that they didn't intend to do

786
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,440
i like what another researcher said

787
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,799
about this

788
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,520
he said that dark patterns supplant user

789
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,760
value in favor of shareholder value

790
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
so some of the types here i definitely

791
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,880
encourage you to check them out on the

792
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,559
site if you if you're not familiar with

793
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,880
these already once you read them you'll

794
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,320
never you'll start seeing them

795
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,640
everywhere probably every day

796
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
there's bait and switch where you try to

797
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,159
accomplish one thing and something

798
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,159
undesirable happens you could refer i

799
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,720
suppose to the trump campaign one where

800
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,919
people thought they were making one

801
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,679
payment and they were making recurring

802
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,760
payments as a bait and switch

803
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,679
there's confirm shaming

804
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,200
which we talked about in an earlier

805
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,360
session the example there on the right

806
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,320
you you try to um opt out of something

807
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,240
and it tries to humiliate you or trick

808
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,480
you guilt you into staying so the

809
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
choices there are you know daily guide

810
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,640
to healthier life you you want to live

811
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,559
healthier by clicking the big blue

812
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,679
button or you don't want to be healthier

813
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,520
this is the other one that you can click

814
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
and of course that's in small font that

815
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,120
you can hardly see

816
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,240
um so you know the impact of that it's

817
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,640
just kind of shitty and annoying

818
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,559
but other dark patterns as you can

819
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,679
imagine

820
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,559
are much more powerful and even

821
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,559
potentially devastating friend spamming

822
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
for example that could just be

823
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
embarrassing right but it is a huge form

824
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,720
of annoyance you you maybe you're

825
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,000
filling out a form and there's a little

826
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,520
checkbox that's pre-selected that you

827
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
didn't notice that says share with my

828
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,960
contacts and all of a sudden you hit

829
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,080
submit and as the page is refreshing

830
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,240
you're like holy crap i just saw that

831
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,640
and this went out to hundreds of my

832
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
friends or something they were all

833
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,640
invited to this new website or or

834
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,360
whatever

835
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,159
again mike montero this quote really hit

836
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,840
home for me from his book ruined by

837
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,320
design dark patterns are the canaries in

838
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,720
the coal mine of an ethical design a

839
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
company who's willing to keep a customer

840
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,799
hostage is willing to do worse so it

841
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,559
sounds kind of like the iceberg effect

842
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,559
right if you if you know that a company

843
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,919
is willing to do some of these

844
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,760
particular things there's probably a lot

845
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
else going on there that might not be

846
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,159
too great as well

847
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,480
uh examples um

848
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,880
this is uh venmo i'm sure you're all

849
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,960
very familiar with interestingly enough

850
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,080
i believe to this day venmo payments are

851
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,640
still public by default and this could

852
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,159
definitely be one of those hey it's not

853
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,640
a big deal venmo is a social kind of app

854
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,320
i kind of know that if i go in there

855
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,240
what i do is being shared with other

856
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,440
people but it it has been public by

857
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
default and people

858
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,320
complained about that and there were a

859
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,200
couple of websites that were set up

860
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
to demonstrate this they with good

861
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,320
intentions um one was vice-mo uh which

862
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,279
basically showed everybody uh they they

863
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,039
basically chose key words for things

864
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,559
like uh sex and drugs uh

865
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,240
prostitution

866
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,640
alcohol and things like that they may

867
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
have been originally posted in good fun

868
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
and had nothing to do with those things

869
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,159
or they may have been legitimate but the

870
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,480
idea was all of these things are public

871
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,720
and you can go to a site and you can see

872
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,360
them happening in real time

873
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,279
you might be like well but they did that

874
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,080
publicly on venmo that's one venue but

875
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,559
that information was there publicly to

876
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,559
be taken and put in another venue where

877
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,080
the people weren't necessarily expecting

878
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,919
to show up and there was a twitter

879
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,679
account i think that did the exact same

880
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,679
thing you do have the option to change

881
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,320
this now but i think it's still public

882
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
by default

883
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,200
this is probably a worse example

884
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,080
strava good app i i've used it myself in

885
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,360
the past

886
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,360
they brainstormed a feature so this

887
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
again wasn't an accident

888
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,399
they called it flyby and the idea by

889
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,120
again by default it just got rolled out

890
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
was that when you ran by someone who was

891
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
also using

892
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,600
strava it would show you an image of

893
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
them it would show you their running

894
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,159
route kind of effectively revealing

895
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,880
where they lived you know potentially

896
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,360
and of course they got a lot of backlash

897
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,480
for this

898
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,440
and i believe they kept it but they did

899
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
make it so that you had to opt into it

900
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,159
in this case so again by privacy by

901
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,480
default privacy by design that should

902
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,440
have been

903
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,519
private by default

904
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,320
uh

905
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,240
another maybe way of looking at this

906
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,159
case study is it would be interesting to

907
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
know who was on the design team here

908
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,399
we're talking about inclusive design if

909
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,320
there had been more women perhaps on

910
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
this particular team would they have

911
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,720
pushed back on this particular feature a

912
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,200
little harder and said are you crazy you

913
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
just designed stalkerware because in

914
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,679
fact that's what they had done right

915
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,200
store aware doesn't have to be something

916
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,519
that is intentionally designed it can be

917
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,559
incidental

918
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,279
as

919
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,960
in which is likely what happened in this

920
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,280
particular case

921
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,719
another example

922
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,119
my wife found this one

923
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,839
she was checking out on delta airlines

924
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,918
and she's already got her seat you've

925
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,918
probably all seen this one on one side

926
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,040
or another

927
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,119
and she's ready to go and you get this

928
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,440
window that says move to main cabin and

929
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,679
that costs a hundred dollars more and

930
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,719
there's a big red button there that says

931
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,679
uh what does it say move to

932
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,119
move to main cabin right so by default

933
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
they're getting you to pay another 100

934
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,800
bucks if you're not looking you just hit

935
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,879
that and you keep going the button that

936
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,280
you want more likely is the tiniest

937
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
script on that page

938
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,918
and it's lower contrast than anything

939
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,079
else there and it says continue with

940
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,918
basic economy

941
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,079
now this particular

942
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,680
dark pattern and that's what it is of

943
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
course is just kind of annoying right it

944
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,480
slows you down you probably aren't going

945
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
to be fooled by it but you'll be annoyed

946
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,079
that you have to find the link that you

947
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,040
wanted to find but it is a dark pattern

948
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,480
and it might trick people into spending

949
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
money they didn't want but this patent

950
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,320
itself is the one that gets a lot of

951
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
people in trouble because if it's not

952
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,079
here upgrading me to uh you know but

953
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,839
with a hundred dollars it might be that

954
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,839
the small print says something or the

955
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,599
check box that's pre-selected that says

956
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,200
share this with all of my contacts

957
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,440
and there you know it could be a lot

958
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
worse

959
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,839
secondly be transparent about what

960
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,280
personal data is being used

961
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,640
especially with

962
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,760
pii personally identifiable information

963
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,839
probably familiar with that

964
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,079
that's generally data points that are

965
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,880
pretty unique to you so your name is

966
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
only uh you know there might be more

967
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
than one of robert stribley but there's

968
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,200
one person with my email there's one

969
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,720
person with my phone number social

970
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,680
security number uh all those things help

971
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
narrow down to who you are and of course

972
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,960
that makes it easier for someone to

973
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,040
steal your identity so if they're using

974
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
that information if they're you're

975
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,400
filling out a form and entering that

976
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,520
again

977
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,920
maybe i trust that

978
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,400
cvs let's use cvs as an example for a

979
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,680
very specific reason uh i maybe trust

980
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,720
cvs but when i look at their privacy

981
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,040
statement as i did which is on the wall

982
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,960
physically next to a kiosk in cvs

983
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,200
it says that they do share my data with

984
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,839
other parties to help me and i don't

985
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,440
know who they are they might all be

986
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,760
trustworthy but when i was in cvs

987
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
recently after roe v wade was overturned

988
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,480
i see a list of their uh services

989
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
includes uh pregnancy services and

990
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,800
pregnancy testing and things like that

991
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
and i could walk up to a kiosk and

992
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,640
literally you know indicate as a person

993
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
that that i'm interested in something

994
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,560
like that who's that being shared with i

995
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,680
don't know

996
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,960
um 87 of the us population can be

997
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
uniquely identified by just a date of

998
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,440
birth gender and zip code

999
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,200
notice that those three things are not

1000
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
pii

1001
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
they're not pii but just with those

1002
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,119
three things we can almost guaranteedly

1003
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,920
pinpoint who you are so imagine how much

1004
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,320
damage can be done with three points

1005
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
data points pii the more personal

1006
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,920
information that we collect about an

1007
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,839
individual the greater chance that they

1008
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,440
can be harmed on

1009
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,680
so we want to be transparent about why

1010
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,000
personal information is being collected

1011
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
or shared as well

1012
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,599
and we should consider this an

1013
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,200
opportunity right

1014
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,440
to explain the benefits just like

1015
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,800
instagram was trying to do in that

1016
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,720
little screen if we're taking your

1017
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,880
information does it ensure a better

1018
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
experience in the future does it

1019
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,359
personalize ads and offers for them

1020
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,200
with the gdpr in europe you'll see on

1021
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,440
some news sites that actually does

1022
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,200
provide a list of all the third parties

1023
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
that that newspaper is sharing your

1024
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
information with and i opened one and i

1025
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
started scrolling through it and i was

1026
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,760
like whoa this isn't 30 and it was

1027
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,400
something like 600 uh other third

1028
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,880
parties that this newspaper was sharing

1029
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,040
information with so at least i can see

1030
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,960
them am i going to sit there and go

1031
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,160
through them no probably not

1032
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,280
so

1033
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,119
is that a solution i don't know

1034
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,800
be prepared though to explain these

1035
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
benefits in detail and if you can't

1036
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
consider whether you're designing the

1037
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,440
right sort of product

1038
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,599
um example here from lemonade home

1039
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,200
insurance app they do a pretty good job

1040
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,440
of this creating a digestible

1041
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,400
privacy policy they itemize

1042
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,040
what they're doing and also explain why

1043
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,200
and they also promise not to share your

1044
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,480
information with third parties

1045
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,079
of course we want to use clear and

1046
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,680
approachable language

1047
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,920
seems like a no-brainer but you know in

1048
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,440
this study from the new york times in

1049
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,280
2019 they looked at 150 privacy policies

1050
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,440
which sounds like the worst job on earth

1051
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,320
to me

1052
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,960
um and you can see the scattergram of

1053
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
how they performed and unfortunately

1054
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,599
airbnb is way up there in the worst

1055
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,839
sector and they said that their privacy

1056
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,720
policy was particularly inscrutable uh

1057
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,320
and a little excerpt from it there this

1058
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,000
information is necessary for the

1059
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,079
adequate performance of the contract

1060
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,040
between you and us to allow us to comply

1061
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,760
with our legal obligations so we kind of

1062
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,320
all know that legalese is bad but it

1063
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,079
really undermines

1064
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,599
people's privacy when they don't

1065
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,960
understand what they're looking at right

1066
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,839
and it's on purpose as as i say the

1067
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,480
vague language is there to help lawyers

1068
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,200
it's not uh defending the company it's

1069
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,359
not to help us understand what the

1070
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,280
company or organization is doing without

1071
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,440
data

1072
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,359
twitter for whatever faults they may

1073
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,960
have has a reasonably good practice here

1074
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,320
that i like

1075
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,480
they pull some things from their privacy

1076
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,720
policy up front and they say here are

1077
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,640
six things that you should know

1078
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,400
so that i thought was an interesting way

1079
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
of handling it they assume you're not

1080
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
going to read the whole thing but you

1081
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,079
better pay attention to these six things

1082
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,000
we we do advise that and we advise you

1083
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,079
read the rest

1084
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,480
true love is an app that i came across

1085
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,760
which focuses on healing our

1086
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
relationship with technology they have a

1087
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,560
very plain spoken way of uh explaining

1088
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,720
what the app is doing and you know for

1089
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
example language like if you like you

1090
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,960
can help true love by giving permission

1091
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,440
to collect anonymized data through unity

1092
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,000
analytics this helps catch bugs and

1093
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,839
blips and then they ask for your

1094
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,839
permission to even do that you can opt

1095
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,760
out of it and you notice in the screen

1096
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,839
capture on the right it also talks about

1097
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,319
the data that you enter is only stored

1098
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,640
in icloud it doesn't apparently go to

1099
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,800
them

1100
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,119
uh some guidelines in the obvious i

1101
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,520
guess is avoid legalese and jargon your

1102
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,119
terms and conditions really doesn't have

1103
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,880
to sound like legal content the bigger

1104
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,400
the organization you are the more likely

1105
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
that is to happen of course

1106
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,240
consider different age groups and levels

1107
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,079
of savviness

1108
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,480
remember that most adult americans read

1109
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,160
at about a basic or intermediate

1110
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,960
literacy level 50 percent can't read a

1111
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,839
book written at an 8th grade level when

1112
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,280
i first saw that i thought it must be

1113
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
wrong and so i kept looking at it and

1114
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
that that is accurate

1115
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,560
the content marketing institute

1116
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,960
recommends writing for about a 14 or 15

1117
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
year old then

1118
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,240
and we could also think about though if

1119
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,640
we do believe that content could be

1120
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,720
aimed at a different audience of course

1121
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,040
thinking about carefully cr crafted

1122
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,319
personas who is our audience um

1123
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,119
you know try to avoid broad stereotypes

1124
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,640
and things like that that might help you

1125
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
adjust this reading level a little bit

1126
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,800
but so many of the apps and websites

1127
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,079
that we're talking about are aimed for

1128
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,359
very broad broad market

1129
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,280
fifth give users options to control

1130
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,040
their own data

1131
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,119
so google does allow a privacy checkup

1132
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,960
of sorts

1133
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,760
which

1134
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,599
shows you how and why your data is being

1135
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,040
used they have some controls that you

1136
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,920
can use to go in turn off your tracking

1137
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,280
uh turn off your youtube history etc

1138
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,119
not saying google is doing great with

1139
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,800
everything i'm going to use facebook as

1140
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,880
an example in a moment too

1141
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,400
but i feel like if we're using these

1142
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,160
sites and some people do need to use

1143
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,720
them they should be aware of

1144
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,480
what they're doing so this is a good

1145
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,319
moment to recall then dr kavukian's

1146
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,440
maxim

1147
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,319
keep these and keep these privacy

1148
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,560
settings private by default keep these

1149
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,520
settings private by default

1150
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
some other examples of user controls

1151
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,640
here we're seeing more and more of these

1152
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
of course with cookies and allowing them

1153
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,599
or not

1154
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,359
the one on the left is trying to do a

1155
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,079
nice job i think of saying use necessary

1156
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,480
cookies allow selection or just allow

1157
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,040
all cookies but it's kind of cluttered

1158
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,640
and hard to understand what's going on

1159
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,720
there you really have to sit there and

1160
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,480
stare at it to know what you're about to

1161
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,079
click on so i really think that one

1162
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,079
could be simplified even though maybe

1163
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,680
the intentions are good the one on the

1164
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,160
right on the other hand is very clean

1165
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
and simple looking so i can just accept

1166
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,079
and continue or manage cookies but i

1167
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,440
don't know what's happening i don't know

1168
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,359
what's happening when i click uh accept

1169
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,280
and continue what does that mean accept

1170
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,480
and continue giving you all the data or

1171
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,040
uh only necessary i'm probably going to

1172
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,800
assume that it's saying allow all

1173
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,400
cookies basically is what that means

1174
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,319
also ensure the privacy features are

1175
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,160
placed contextually and that they're

1176
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,640
easy to find

1177
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,000
important information shouldn't be

1178
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,480
hidden in the footer eight point font

1179
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,079
you know buried in the terms and

1180
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,280
conditions

1181
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,720
it would be nice to see that you could

1182
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,520
go on most sites and see a privacy icon

1183
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
like this directing you to where you can

1184
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,599
attend to some of these things

1185
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,760
and it isn't just terms and conditions

1186
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,240
it's tools to help you maintain your

1187
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,440
privacy and to turn things on and off

1188
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,359
contextual and easy to find also means

1189
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,760
onboarding so when people first use your

1190
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,359
app telling them

1191
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,960
this is what we're going to be doing

1192
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,400
this is who we're sharing with are you

1193
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
in or you're out and then just in time

1194
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,520
alerts meaning uh there are some things

1195
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,880
that maybe you're doing for the first

1196
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
time within app or a website and letting

1197
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,359
people know at just that moment

1198
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,359
this is what we're about to do these are

1199
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,359
the people that we're about to share

1200
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,520
information with

1201
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,680
so mozilla does this you know to some

1202
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,440
degree if you download the browser open

1203
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,760
it up the first thing they show you is

1204
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,079
privacy information

1205
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,319
and again facebook um if you're going to

1206
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,280
use facebook they do have privacy tools

1207
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
and they may uh they're one or two

1208
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,720
clicks away if you know where to look

1209
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,960
for them you can turn off some things

1210
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,000
and and create better privacy and so a

1211
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,880
lot of times i know that people do go to

1212
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,960
facebook for a sense of community maybe

1213
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,040
they can't find elsewhere it is valuable

1214
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,200
to them that way and so at least be

1215
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,760
equipped you know if you're using that

1216
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,440
platform

1217
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,400
um onboarding example here from babel

1218
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,079
it's very high level but you see in the

1219
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,680
right hand side there they're also

1220
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,720
trying to set up um reasons for you to

1221
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,319
allow babel uh to track you uh they

1222
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,839
don't go into a lot of detail there

1223
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,599
honestly but you can see the pattern at

1224
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,040
least there's an opportunity when you're

1225
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,200
first coming on to review this

1226
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,079
information and know what's happening

1227
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,319
seventh remind users regularly about

1228
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,920
their privacy options and encourage them

1229
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,280
to take care of them

1230
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,280
facebook and google both do this they

1231
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,440
allow you to set reminders so that you

1232
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,480
can go back um if it's anything like the

1233
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,119
alerts they seem to change all the time

1234
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,640
and they make when i turn off alerts

1235
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,960
they make up new alerts to annoy me um

1236
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,880
so the privacy things probably change as

1237
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,480
well and you'll want to go and look at

1238
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
those and see if it makes sense to

1239
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,800
change them but one final point never

1240
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,720
change users privacy settings without

1241
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,560
telling them in advance

1242
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,880
and also give them the option to opt out

1243
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
of such changes this seems like a

1244
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,520
no-brainer right but i alluded to this

1245
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,000
earlier on a few years ago

1246
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,040
facebook did indeed make users likes

1247
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,760
available overnight and a lot of people

1248
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,520
kind of just said well big deal you know

1249
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,119
they're my likes

1250
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,960
but that does ignore the fact that that

1251
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,720
could have outed some people at the time

1252
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,640
could have outed people in the lgbt

1253
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,839
community

1254
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,560
i grew up in a very strict uh

1255
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,160
fundamentalist kind of environment and i

1256
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,000
know a lot of people this could have

1257
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,680
applied to where they could have been

1258
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
kicked out of their homes they could

1259
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,599
have been disenfranchised from their

1260
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,160
friends from their church or whatever

1261
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,760
but that also could reveal people's

1262
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,920
personal political religious beliefs as

1263
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,880
well

1264
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,319
i had the opportunity to talk to an

1265
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,480
employee at facebook at the time and

1266
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
asked how they justified that change and

1267
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,119
they responded that the company believed

1268
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,599
in transparency and wanted people to be

1269
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,240
transparent about their interests

1270
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
of course that aligned with what mark

1271
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,480
zuckerberg has famously said as well

1272
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,040
that he thinks that privacy is no longer

1273
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,599
a social norm i would say in response to

1274
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,880
that that depends on who you are and uh

1275
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,640
not necessarily what you have to hide

1276
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,839
per se

1277
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,400
but maybe what you need to protect

1278
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
so you know we don't have the right to

1279
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,319
make decisions about people's data and

1280
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,480
interests on their behalf assuming that

1281
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,720
everyone's information can be safely

1282
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,119
made public really kind of comes from a

1283
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,200
position of privilege like doesn't apply

1284
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,839
to me i'm cool with it

1285
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,920
certainly not inclusive

1286
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,599
so we shouldn't make decisions like that

1287
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,280
which can profoundly affect people's

1288
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,920
privacy without their consent

1289
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,280
in conclusion

1290
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,440
again empathy we talk a lot about

1291
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,760
empathy and design if we want to design

1292
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
with empathy we won't design for

1293
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,440
experiences that we wouldn't want to use

1294
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,400
ourselves we won't incorporate dark

1295
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,720
patterns we'll learn how to push back on

1296
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,319
dark patterns how to come up with better

1297
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,680
solutions

1298
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,520
if you have to do that you can maybe

1299
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,839
even show the company that you're going

1300
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,520
to make people happy

1301
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,960
if they know that you're studiously

1302
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,960
avoiding doing some things that other

1303
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,359
organizations are doing so another quote

1304
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,599
there from dr ann cavuccian she says

1305
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,559
privacy

1306
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,680
is about not about secrecy it's about

1307
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,079
control controlling your own information

1308
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,880
your own personal information so if we

1309
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,119
want to ensure people have control over

1310
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,880
their own personal information if we

1311
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,119
want to ensure our experiences are truly

1312
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,520
user centered i think we'll keep these

1313
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,640
best practices for privacy in mind thank

1314
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,720
you

1315
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,440
thank you we have about 10 minutes for

1316
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,440
questions

1317
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,760
right well i imagine there's a lot of

1318
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,200
conversations going on at planned

1319
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,960
parenthood and similar organizations

1320
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,640
right now to attend to some of these

1321
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,760
things that might have seemed a little

1322
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,559
bit more innocent in the past

1323
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,880
but if i remember correctly in this case

1324
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,440
they removed the facebook pixel just

1325
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,839
from certain parts of the site and left

1326
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,760
it in others

1327
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,520
might you know there's a lot of nuance

1328
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,920
to that that i'm not up to speed on um

1329
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,800
but yeah i think it's imperative uh

1330
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
more so than ever for companies to be

1331
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,160
thinking about this kind of stuff for

1332
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,319
that reason and a lot of times we talk

1333
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,920
about design and we talk thankfully

1334
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,000
increasingly about accessibility but

1335
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,680
that's why i think that this

1336
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,200
particular topic is increasingly

1337
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,960
important for companies and

1338
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,880
organizations to be thinking about as

1339
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,599
well because it's not really a practice

1340
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,079
within most organizations to think about

1341
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,880
privacy by design so i i don't know how

1342
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,480
to answer your question other than to

1343
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,880
say that maybe this time period if

1344
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,480
people were already becoming concerned

1345
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,680
about it

1346
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,240
overturning roe v wade has made this

1347
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,559
starkly important to a lot of people

1348
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,079
overnight

1349
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,079
and that this may help to energize

1350
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,559
people into thinking more about it yeah

1351
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,160
and i'm so sorry so sorry we have 10

1352
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,359
minutes to

1353
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,839
wrap this around for the next speaker so

1354
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,040
if there's any questions then you're

1355
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,200
open to it to take in them

1356
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,520

1357
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,860
