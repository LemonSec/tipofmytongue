secrets of social media psyops a look

into how social media has been

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
weaponized for psychological warfare

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
with yours truly via scilab

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,920

i'm the founder and ceo of girls who

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
skills of hacking so that they can

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
change the future

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
i have also started building my own

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
end-to-end election system called secure

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
open vote

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,080
my election hacking from the deaf from

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
defcon was highlighted at a

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,360
congressional hearing on election

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
security

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
let's start off with the definition and

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
then a little history

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
psyops is short for

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,319
psychological warfare operations which

51
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,040
are military operations usually aimed at

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
influencing the enemy's state of mind

53
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
through non-combative means

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
these techniques are used by military

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,440
and political forces to influence the

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,239
beliefs emotions and behaviors of

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,760
citizens

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
at the end of the day it's all marketing

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
but instead of a product they are

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,119
selling you an ideal

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
now for some history

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
it was the year 329 bc and alexander the

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
great was conquering empires all around

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,080
he quickly took over large parts of

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,159
europe and the middle east

66
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,560
as his army started taking over more and

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
more land the number of soldiers he had

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,519
to defend those lands started to dwindle

69
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,599
causing alexander to wonder if he could

70
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
keep all this newfound territory to

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,040
himself

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
that's when alexander the great had a

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
brilliant idea that would intimidate the

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
enemy without having to do much work at

75
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,400
all

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,959
after conquering a new city alexander

77
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,680
had his armies leave behind large pieces

78
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
of armor that would fit a seven foot

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,720
tall giant when the enemy soldiers

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
passed by they would see massive chest

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
plates helmets and boots this surely

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
intimidated the enemy making them wonder

83
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,959
if they could ever defeat alexander the

84
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,640
great's army of giants

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
years later genghis khan also proved

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,879
that the power of intimidation can go a

87
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,000
long way

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
before attacking a city he would send

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
messengers ahead to tell of the horrible

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,959
huge army that was coming to attack when

91
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
this presumably huge army came all you

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
could see was a massive dust storm

93
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
coming your way

94
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,399
this wasn't caused by the soldiers in

95
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,280
the army but rather by rocks and heavy

96
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
objects dragged behind the horses

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,440
creating the illusion of a large army

98
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,919
his archers also shot arrows that would

99
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
whistle in the wind further intimidating

100
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
the enemy

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
now we will jump ahead to world war one

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
and world war ii

103
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,080
back in 1914 the germans were the first

104
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
to send pamphlets to the enemy troops

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,479
after observing how well this tactic

106
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,880
worked the united states decided to jump

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,520
in and make some propaganda of their own

108
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,240
these leaflets had topics such as how

109
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
successful the american troops were and

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
how poorly the german troops were doing

111
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
each nation used propaganda on their own

112
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,800
citizens as well

113
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
their goal was to get them to enlist in

114
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,039
the military or to have them send money

115
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,479
and supplies to help the troops

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,199
in the vietnam war the u.s military

117
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,440
played a soundtrack called ghost tape

118
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,639
number 10

119
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
in the vietnamese jungles at night to

120
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
persuade the troops to surrender

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,960
usa u.s forces hoped that the operation

122
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
co-named wandering soul would prey on

123
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
the fears of many vietnamese

124
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,720
the vietnamese culture includes beliefs

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,680
and rituals that show respect for the

126
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
dead they believe if a person is not

127
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
properly buried they will wander the

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
earth as a wandering soul

129
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,639
the gulf war psychological tactics were

130
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,120
successful because they threatened

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,360
consequences to those who did not abide

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,479
by the coalition's rules

133
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,720
the american military also promised the

134
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,039
iraqi troops that no harm would come to

135
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,440
them and they would be treated very well

136
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
if they surrendered

137
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,440
these messages were delivered by

138
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,960
air-dropping pamphlets over the

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,599
battlefield

140
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
many iraqi troops surrendered holding

141
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
that pamphlet

142
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
messages were also delivered by radio as

143
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,960
it was one of the few options soldiers

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
in the field had to distract themselves

145
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,080
from the war

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,880
the arabs also tried some psyops tactics

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
on the coalition forces using a

148
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
broadcaster by the name of baghdad betty

149
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
she told the soldiers that while the

150
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
while out were

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,919
the their wives were at home sleeping

152
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,160
with celebrities such as

153
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,080
mel gibson

154
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,039
tom cruise and this is the best one

155
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,680
bart simpson

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
this illustrates why you need to do

157
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
research on your target audience before

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
launching a campaign

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,319
you may be wondering how a tiny piece of

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,800
paper or radio message can make soldiers

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
give up all they have already sacrificed

162
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
and how warning messages intimidate

163
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,360
entire armies

164
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,840
to answer these questions let's take a

165
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,800
deeper look into the prior examples

166
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,280
before any psyops attack is used on the

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,759
enemy they're usually tired hungry

168
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
stressed and even depressed

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,639
additionally all propaganda typically

170
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,199
ties into one or more of the

171
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
seven deadly sins

172
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,160
lust

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,319
gluttony pride

174
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,520
sloth

175
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,639
wrath

176
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
greed and envy

177
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
these seven deadly sins are the greatest

178
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
desires known to humankind so avoiding

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
these feelings in such a horrible

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,120
condition is virtually impossible they

181
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,599
also play on the strong human emotions

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,720
of

183
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,560
anger

184
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
fear

185
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
and hate

186
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
these emotions are also the easiest to

187
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
stir up in an individual

188
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
with that in mind let's look back on

189
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
alexander the great and why he left

190
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,400
behind those large pieces of armor

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
keep in mind back then the average

192
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
height was much shorter than people

193
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,759
these days

194
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,520
picture yourself as one of these

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,240
soldiers tracking down alexander's army

196
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
and finding pieces of armor that are

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
twice the size of yours that would

198
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,960
definitely strike fear in your heart

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,280
genghis khan used the power of false

200
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
numbers to his advantage as he stormed

201
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
through cities and towns

202
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,159
this time imagine yourself as a soldier

203
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,440
in a city near a dusty plain as far as

204
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
the eye can see

205
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
suddenly you hear what you believe to be

206
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
thousands of horse hooves in the

207
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,240
distance a huge cloud of dust appears as

208
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,720
you watch your certain doom approaching

209
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
practically engulfing your seemingly

210
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
tiny army by comparison

211
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,279
again fear was the motion used here

212
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,399
in times world war one and world war ii

213
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
you would see propaganda everywhere in

214
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,480
your town or city coming in forms such

215
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,360
as

216
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
posters billboards

217
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
newspaper ads and pamphlets

218
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
these posters including sayings such as

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
i want you for the us army which plays

220
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,600
on pride and in this one he volunteered

221
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
for submarine service which plays on

222
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
lust

223
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
that covers things back home but what

224
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
about campaigns on the front lines

225
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,519
because of the british blockade getting

226
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
food to germany was virtually impossible

227
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
leaving the german troops with little

228
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
rations

229
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
this gave the british the idea to send

230
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
out leaflets with pictures of their

231
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,839
soldiers eating great food and smiling

232
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,600
brightly many men went to sleep hungry

233
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,480
that night holding that leaflet

234
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,120
this is a perfect example of gluttony in

235
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
a psyops campaign

236
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
now picture yourself as a vietnamese

237
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
soldier walking through a dark damp

238
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,680
jungle in the middle of the night you're

239
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
tired hungry and just want to go back

240
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
home to your family who you haven't seen

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
in weeks when suddenly you hear the

242
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
sound of your fellow soldiers who have

243
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,519
died their souls wandering through the

244
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
jungle forever and the eerie sounds of

245
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
buddhist funeral music screaming crying

246
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
and the sounds of ghosts and spirits

247
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,560
let's take a listen

248
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
um

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,890
um

250
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,960
[Music]

251
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,279
pretty freaky huh

252
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,279
i would just run away right then and

253
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
there

254
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
at the time of the gulf war the u.s sent

255
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,399
pamphlets out to the arabian soldiers

256
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,560
telling them that if they surrendered

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
they would treat them very well and no

258
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
harm would come to them

259
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
these pamphlets were designed with the

260
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,040
help of cooperative iraqi prisoners of

261
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,920
war

262
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,480
they advised against using the color red

263
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
and featured soldiers with bowls of

264
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,720
fruits including bananas like as you can

265
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,640
see here to the left

266
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
bananas are a delicacy to the rabiens

267
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
this played on the sins of greed and

268
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
gluttony

269
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
back then they put propaganda where

270
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
every large number of people would see

271
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
it every day like

272
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
posters at a grocery store or an ad in a

273
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,839
newspaper

274
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,800
these days what is a widely used means

275
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
of sharing opinions and information

276
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,279
that's right

277
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
social media

278
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,079
eighty-two percent of us citizens have a

279
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
social media profile most likely you

280
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,959
have one too

281
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,920
propaganda used to be a blunt tool that

282
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,720
had to be tailored to appeal to a large

283
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,760
general audience

284
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,800
with social media ads can be targeted

285
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,720
directly to a specific demographic

286
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
there are many social media platforms

287
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
but today we will be focusing on two big

288
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,240
ones i don't know if you've heard of

289
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,320
these but facebook and twitter

290
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
have you ever noticed that your social

291
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,360
media ads seem to be targeting you

292
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
the other day you were looking up

293
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,079
cupcake recipes and suddenly facebook

294
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,040
feed is recommending the baking topic in

295
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
ads for mixers

296
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
that is because the algorithm is

297
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,040
targeting you by tracking your likes

298
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,079
searches who you follow and who you

299
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,560
interact with

300
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
you also have a digital fingerprint that

301
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
ties in all your devices searches apps

302
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,079
and pretty much everything you do online

303
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
together

304
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,680
facebook and twitter know you better

305
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,279
than you know yourself

306
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,440
the data from the algorithm helps them

307
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,760
recommend topics and advertisements to

308
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
you

309
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,279
if you have already done some research

310
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920
in modern psyops this name will be no

311
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,240
surprise to you

312
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,720
cambridge analytica

313
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,639
i love the one person that chuckled okay

314
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
cambridge analytica was a political

315
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,600
consulting firm that used large data

316
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,079
sets to target and change the minds of

317
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,479
voters

318
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,279
though the parent company was located in

319
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
great britain they saw a huge

320
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,480
opportunity in the united states

321
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,199
back in 2016

322
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
consultants working for the donald

323
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,680
trump's presidential campaign saw out

324
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,320
cambridge analytica to help him and his

325
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,079
campaign team

326
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
trump's campaign spent over 44 million

327
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,120
dollars to run 5.9 million facebook ads

328
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
at its peak cambridge analytica was

329
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,320
spending over 1 million dollars a day on

330
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
facebook ads alone

331
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,720
meanwhile hillary clinton's campaign

332
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,839
spent 28 million on 66 000 ads

333
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
it all starts with facebook personality

334
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
surveys

335
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
jane bombauer professor of law at the

336
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,560
university of arizona best describes how

337
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
these surveys started out

338
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,920
in 2014 alexander kogan a young

339
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,639
professor of law at cambridge university

340
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,760
made a personality quiz called

341
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
this is your digital life that attempted

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,880
to categorize these people who took it

343
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,600
into a set of psychometric profiles

344
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
almost everyone who took the quiz agreed

345
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,320
to let him access not only their public

346
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
account information

347
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
but all of it including every like

348
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,360
dislike follow but also the profiles of

349
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
their friends

350
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
that's how a few hundred thousand survey

351
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,160
takers grew into a database of 87

352
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
million people

353
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,079
and even though only those few hundred

354
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
thousand took the personality quiz that

355
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
mapped out their psychometric profile

356
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,519
the researcher could use the results to

357
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,920
build a statistical model that could

358
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,079
then predict the psychometric profiles

359
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,120
of the other 86 million facebook users

360
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,440
the profiles were then provided to the

361
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,240
researchers company cambridge analytica

362
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,639
which used them as assets to try to get

363
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,199
political consulting clients like donald

364
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,240
trump

365
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
in 2015

366
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,320
facebook changed its policies to

367
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,240
restrict how third-party companies

368
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,440
collect information from facebook users

369
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
by the time the change was implemented

370
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,800
cambridge analytica had already received

371
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,360
the data

372
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
they used these facebook personality

373
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,399
surveys to sort people into a few main

374
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
categories

375
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,240
the survey coupled with other facebook

376
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
data created what is known as an ocean

377
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,000
score ocean also known as the big five

378
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,519
stood for

379
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
openness

380
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
conscientiousness

381
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,560
extroversion agreeableness and

382
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,160
neuroticism

383
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,880
depending on your ocean score they would

384
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
determine if you are a

385
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,160
persuadable

386
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,040
aka someone whose political views could

387
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,319
be easily changed

388
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,040
they didn't target their ads at

389
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
all the persuadables they only focused

390
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,600
on the swinging states florida wisconsin

391
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
pennsylvania and michigan

392
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
they knew that if they flipped these few

393
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
states they would win the election in

394
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,959
order to swing the persuadables they

395
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,039
created ad campaigns

396
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,839
one example of an ad campaign that

397
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,400
cambridge analytica created was the

398
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
crooked hillary campaign

399
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,839
their logo included handcuffs as the o's

400
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,160
and their slogan was lock her up

401
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,280
their art department would create many

402
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,839
uncredited

403
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,480
images and post them to facebook

404
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
people who received these ads would not

405
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
only like and share the ad but would

406
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,440
screenshot it and share it to other

407
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
social media platforms

408
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,640
effectively free advertising

409
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
cambridge analytica created this spark

410
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,440
and social media became the flame ending

411
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,600
with the explosive 2016 election results

412
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
it is likely we will never again have

413
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
free and fair elections where candidates

414
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
are chosen by their platform and

415
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,840
ideas instead of lies and fake

416
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,919
advertising as you can see

417
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,039
these ads use childish bullying tactics

418
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,080
such as name-calling as well as playing

419
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,399
with wrath fear and pride

420
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
cambridge was at its high point

421
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
following the 2016 elections when

422
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,080
whistleblowers like britney kaiser and

423
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
chris wiley decided to take a stand

424
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
against the company

425
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
after pleading guilty for taking

426
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
people's personal data and refusing to

427
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,919
give it back

428
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,880
this might be a shocker

429
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,679
the company declared bankruptcy and shut

430
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,360
down for good

431
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,559
but this can't be the end of the story

432
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,799
what happened to all that data

433
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,760
i'm sure it wasn't simply deleted

434
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,679
it's no surprise that their business

435
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,120
closing opened up a new era of

436
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,480
disinformation

437
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
for hire

438
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,120
social media has the tools to sow

439
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,520
disinformation at scale to affect

440
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,000
anything from a small local government

441
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
election to spreading disinformation

442
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,880
about coveted vaccines or even upsetting

443
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
a country's elections

444
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
this can be seen today as spanish

445
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,679
language anti-vaccine ads are pushed on

446
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,640
facebook as shown here

447
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
it really makes you wonder where this

448
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,120
disinformation is coming from and what

449
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
their goal is

450
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,160
an example of influencing elections

451
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
cambridge analytica was able to flip the

452
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
elections in trinidad and tobago

453
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
they were hired by the majority

454
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,760
indian united national congress party to

455
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,840
defeat the incumbent

456
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,160
people's national movement which

457
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,960
primarily attracts afro-trimbangonian

458
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,080
voters

459
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,400
they researched both audiences and

460
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,039
decided to target the young voters they

461
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,600
knew the young indian unc voters would

462
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,039
do what their parents told them to do

463
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,440
and go vote for the unc

464
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
so they focused their efforts on the

465
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,520
afro-trained bangonian voters

466
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
creating a campaign called

467
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,360
do so to increase apathy towards voting

468
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,559
and politics in general encouraging them

469
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
not to vote

470
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,640
did this tactic work

471
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
yes it did the united national congress

472
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,760
party won the election

473
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,919
in case you were thinking this is recent

474
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,280
news this happened back in 2010 meaning

475
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
that this sort of election manipulation

476
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,320
has been going on for a long time

477
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
besides creating campaigns and posting

478
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
to social media these private firms

479
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
offer the ultimate power in a

480
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,200
disinformation campaign

481
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
deniability

482
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,799
governments and political figures can

483
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
contract these disinformation companies

484
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,080
to do their dirty work making it very

485
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,400
difficult to trace the source

486
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
content farms produce

487
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,159
thousands of legitimate looking accounts

488
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,799
complete with an untraceable unique

489
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,320
profile picture and a posting history

490
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,400
the bonus is real people spread these

491
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
conspiracies and lies

492
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,440
by sharing and reposting on multiple

493
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,559
platforms giving a huge return on a

494
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,840
relatively small investment

495
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,320
if you tell a lie big enough and keep

496
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,039
repeating it people will eventually come

497
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,840
to believe it

498
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,799
donald trump has been doing this even

499
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,039
before he was out of office

500
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,840
he told his constituents that if he

501
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,400
didn't win the election it was rigged

502
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,799
conditioning his followers to rise up if

503
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,120
he did not win the election

504
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
once the election results were in and

505
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
were certified that joe biden was

506
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
declared the winner

507
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,600
trump started claiming the election was

508
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
rigged stirring up wrath in his

509
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,799
followers

510
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,679
leading to the january 6 attack on the

511
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
capital

512
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,280
trump still tells this lie

513
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
that the election was rigged despite the

514
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,320
total lack of evidence yet his followers

515
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,799
believe it

516
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,000
the underlying message to his followers

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,080
is if you don't win something it's

518
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
because it was stolen from you

519
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
believe it or not cambridge analytica

520
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
wasn't the only one persuading voters in

521
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,159
the u.s

522
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,720
russian actors also use social media to

523
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,760
cause havoc and divide the country

524
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,159
why in the world would russia do this

525
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,799
unlike cambridge analytica they are not

526
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,240
out to gain money but rather power

527
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,120
soviet premier khrushchev said

528
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
we do not have to invade the united

529
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,280
states we will destroy you from within

530
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
that is exactly what russia is doing

531
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
dividing the country so it destroys

532
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,520
itself from within

533
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,679
i wonder why everyone tries to gain

534
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,840
power by belittling others instead of

535
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
bettering themselves if the world was in

536
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,159
friendly competition with each other we

537
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,919
could have made so much more progress as

538
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,640
a society

539
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,280
the russian actors created facebook

540
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
accounts and groups as well as twitter

541
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,960
bots all impersonating u.s citizens and

542
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,679
organized groups

543
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,799
one example of this is

544
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
south united

545
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,120
as you can see here

546
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,400
this ad was paid for in

547
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,279
rubles

548
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
you can also see the interest tags they

549
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
use let's read some of these fox news

550
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,120
channel

551
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,320
christianity bill o'reilly

552
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,000
let's see mike pence donald trump jr

553
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,039
politics yeah

554
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,320
pretty obvious what their demographic is

555
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,640
people who follow these accounts also

556
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,799
like and repost the content

557
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,880
one of the ad tools on facebook allows

558
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,000
you to send ads to friends and people

559
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
you follow

560
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
you can then pick from thousands of

561
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,000
different keywords targeting even more

562
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
interest groups

563
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
the russians also make fake news

564
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,919
websites that appear to be real news

565
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,400
sources but are actually fake here are

566
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
some examples

567
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,840
when bob goes on facebook and reads an

568
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,159
article on how hillary's crooked he

569
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,240
probably won't check where it came from

570
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,799
but he will like and repost to all his

571
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,200
friends so they can do the same and so

572
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
on and so forth

573
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,640
the younger audience may be thinking

574
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,520
yeah of course it's fake i can tell that

575
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
but you have to understand that the

576
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,919
older audience was brought up believing

577
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,880
all news sources are fully fact checked

578
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
they have applied this belief to all

579
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,200
modern delivery platforms

580
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
after all facebook is where i connect

581
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,039
with my friends and family why would

582
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,039
facebook lie to me

583
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,279
this news article must be real because

584
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,080
the site it's on looks real

585
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,640
turns out this newspaper newspaper's

586
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,279
mailing address is in a shopping mall

587
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,640
between forever 21 and claire's

588
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
there is also a building in washington

589
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,200
dc full of mailboxes

590
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,360
this gives any blogger living in his

591
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,760
parents basement the ability to list a

592
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,320
legitimate sounding physical address on

593
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,158
the bottom of his new site

594
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,360
an interesting fact is that the russians

595
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,000
target both sides not just one like

596
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,520
cambridge did

597
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,039
this way they can divide and conquer

598
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,600
in the u.s russian influence reached

599
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,720
over 126 million people

600
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,760
through facebook alone

601
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,720
they created fake black lives matter

602
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,799
memes that when you clicked on them you

603
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,880
were taken to pages inviting you to a

604
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,159
protest

605
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,880
at the same time they were targeting

606
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,760
adversary groups like blue lives matter

607
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,640
with similar fake pages inviting them to

608
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,159
a protest

609
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,679
at the same location on the same day

610
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,600
the russian government is organizing

611
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,919
face-to-face protests in order to get us

612
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,600
to fight with each other and divide the

613
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,279
country

614
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,400
so far we have talked about facebook but

615
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,240
when you think about political

616
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,320
discussions your mind goes straight to

617
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,159
twitter

618
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,400
just like facebook twitter is used by

619
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,080
russians and other groups so

620
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,039
disinformation to the american populace

621
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,880
many using the same techniques that are

622
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,799
used on facebook

623
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,679
one big problem with twitter is the low

624
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,440
bar for entry

625
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
this allows groups to use tools that

626
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
create many bot accounts

627
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
very quickly

628
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,440
these accounts then go and tweet the

629
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,320
same things once the bot gets caught and

630
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,640
blocked they simply create a new batch

631
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,120
of accounts

632
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,840
the twitter bots also retweet other bots

633
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
tweets as is shown in this beautiful

634
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,159
graphic by daniel gallagher

635
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,919
it's just like turtle bots all the way

636
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,600
down i hope some of you got that

637
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
reference

638
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,279
and at this moment i want to take a

639
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,720
pause

640
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,760
and

641
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,679
like they said earlier take a water

642
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,360
break i don't want anyone passing out

643
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,159
during my talk or falling asleep yes i'm

644
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,799
looking at you in the back

645
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,279
and let's continue

646
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,679
going back to the seven deadly sins in

647
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,720
lust these bot accounts frequently

648
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
feature beautiful young women because

649
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,440
the target audience is primarily male

650
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,200
voters i'd like to take a second to show

651
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,679
the beautiful photoshop quality of some

652
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,000
of their profile pictures as you can see

653
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,919
the girl in the top left they didn't

654
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,159
even photoshop the words to actually fit

655
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,840
around the curve of her hat they just

656
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
like pasted it in and thought oh good

657
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,039
job you know

658
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:28,960
take

659
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
this account for example

660
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,159
these photos were stolen off a columbian

661
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,279
instagram influencers account

662
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,120
if you look over there you can see her

663
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
name is

664
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
obviously not in english you can see

665
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,279
some of the tags like god bless america

666
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,200
conservative

667
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,240
um

668
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,159
trump 2020 sisters by trump etc

669
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,799
but if you look at location estados

670
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,039
unidos that's united states but not in

671
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,360
english wait how many languages are

672
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,760
going on over here

673
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,640
high quality high quality

674
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,480
you've had some history and some

675
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,520
examples now let's walk through a psyops

676
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,360
campaign together

677
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,159
there are six basic steps to a psyops

678
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,640
campaign

679
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,080
plan

680
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,600
target audience

681
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,559
series development product design

682
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,840
dissemination and

683
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,320
evaluation for our example i will be

684
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,879
combining some of these steps together

685
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,720
first step is planning in this phase you

686
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,120
determine your goal and who your target

687
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
audience is

688
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
for our example the objective will be

689
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,799
convincing

690
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,080
bob that unicorns are real so let's call

691
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
this

692
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,480
operation twilight

693
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,120
for any operation it helps to give your

694
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,080
target audience an individual identity

695
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
this makes the series development and

696
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,240
product design so much easier that's why

697
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,679
we have created

698
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,679
bob i'm sorry to anyone named bob in the

699
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,039
audience i'm not targeting you i swear

700
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,000
next we refine our target audience we

701
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
chose bob but

702
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,600
who is bob

703
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,840
we picked bob because he does many

704
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,159
facebook personality surveys and through

705
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,440
those we found out he is a persuadable

706
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,039
he's also very active online with his

707
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,679
friends this will be a force multiplier

708
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,919
to our operation

709
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,240
now that we have our objective and our

710
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,159
target audience

711
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,039
let's move on to

712
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,279
series development and product design

713
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,120
i put these two together because they

714
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,279
happen hand in hand in a campaign

715
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,679
though it seems logical we can't just

716
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,919
make an ad that says

717
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,880
unicorns are real and be done

718
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,840
bob will just laugh at it and move on it

719
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,880
has nothing to do with his interests

720
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,519
what we need to do is slowly pull bob

721
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,000
through a series of targeted ads and

722
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,640
psyops that convince him unicorns are

723
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
real

724
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,880
first we'll send out some articles from

725
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,279
our fake online newspaper that is made

726
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,840
to look like a legitimate popular site

727
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
scary to think that some people might

728
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
actually believe this is real

729
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,000
the article talks about how scientists

730
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,640
have managed to splice the dna of a

731
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
narwhal with the dna of a horse causing

732
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,640
horses to start growing a horn

733
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,080
this article will have links to our

734
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
scientific journal with more articles on

735
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,000
how this dna splicing works

736
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,399
complete with a case study of the

737
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,720
unicorn gene splicing

738
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,039
we can also add legitimate sounding

739
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,640
scientist names and quotes

740
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,679
soon after these similar articles will

741
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,960
be posted

742
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,360
one being how scientists have managed to

743
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,720
manipulate the dna determine its length

744
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,840
of the horn

745
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,760
allowing our unicorns to have a more

746
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,720
normal looking horn

747
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,360
next our art department will generate

748
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,679
pictures of unicorns and since bob is a

749
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,080
bit of a conspiracy nut we will make

750
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
them look as if the pictures come from

751
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,799
surveillance camera footage and hidden

752
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,640
camera shots

753
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
bob will love this and share these

754
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,480
photos with his friends

755
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,720
his friends who share similar interests

756
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,080
believe him

757
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,360
but others are more skeptical when these

758
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,519
friends laugh at him he will simply

759
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,039
share the links to our newspaper and

760
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,640
scientific journals

761
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
causing many of them to join bob as a

762
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,000
unicorn convert

763
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,720
dissemination

764
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,640
dissemination has been happening through

765
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,880
facebook ads that look like legitimate

766
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,240
news articles

767
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,120
we can also create a scientific podcast

768
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,200
interviewing the scientists who made the

769
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,159
unicorn this podcast will be supported

770
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,279
by the numerous fake instagram and

771
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,200
twitter accounts we are using to spread

772
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,799
photos of our unicorn

773
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
finally

774
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,399
we evaluate our operation turns out

775
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,600
it worked

776
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
not only did bob

777
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,840
uh did we convince bob that unicorns

778
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,640
were real he also used our propaganda to

779
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,519
convince his friends that they were real

780
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,159
as a bonus bob started a blog about

781
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,200
unicorns further spreading our message

782
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
he also put together the theory that

783
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,679
scientists could add

784
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,760
wings

785
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,840
now that bob is the admin of

786
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,200
unicornsreal.com he and his friends are

787
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,080
pulling in others all pointing pun

788
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,279
intended

789
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,760
at our original products from our

790
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,240
serious development and product design

791
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,519
phase

792
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,320
this operation has taken on a life of

793
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,199
its own if we wanted to we could create

794
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,000
more surveillance footage of an alicorn

795
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,040
in our lab and for you uncultured folks

796
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,918
an alicorn is a pegasus and a unicorn

797
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,040
together as seen in this picture here

798
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,918
well that was a successful psyops

799
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,280
operation

800
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,440
if we wanted to keep this going we could

801
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,159
revisit all the steps and expand on our

802
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,399
operation to include more and more

803
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,440
people

804
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
but i think we've done enough damage for

805
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,839
today

806
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,639
today you got some history some

807
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,159
psychology and a heavy dose of reality

808
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,480
here are a few examples of how you can

809
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,719
protect yourself against social media

810
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,879
psyops 1.

811
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,079
install an ad blocker this way you only

812
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,280
get feed and not targeted information

813
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
one i highly recommend is pihole which

814
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,160
blocks ads on an entire network

815
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,280
two

816
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,160
don't take any online quizzes or surveys

817
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,839
i know it's tempting to find out what

818
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,240
ice cream flavor you are but it's best

819
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
not to give out personal information no

820
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,720
matter as minor as it may seem

821
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
three when reading an article always

822
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,480
always always always check the sources

823
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,000
and who wrote it

824
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,480
don't forget to compare it to other

825
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,800
articles from trusted sites

826
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,839
and last but not least

827
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,040
four

828
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
always make sure to fact check

829
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,680
everything you see and read online

830
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,839
never base your opinion on just one

831
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,000
thing and learn what both sides have to

832
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,320
say before performing an opinion

833
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
even though social media can be a scary

834
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,640
place it can also be an educational one

835
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,880
and a ton of fun you just need to

836
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,040
balance it with reality go outside and

837
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,560
get some fresh air once in a while

838
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,880
and on that i am bsi lab and you can

839
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
follow me on these social media

840
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,720
platforms

841
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,959
thank you

842
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,639
[Applause]

843
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,359
so if you have any questions uh you can

844
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,280
put them in the matrix or you can come

845
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,160
up and ask the question

846
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,480
um

847
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,359
the election

848
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,240
toward the right-wing candidate um did

849
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,960
you ever hear about this no i didn't do

850
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,320
you know the name of the campaign i'd

851
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,400
like to research it well the dictator's

852
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,119
daughter uh also uh got elected through

853
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,200
the same process but this was back in

854
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,720
2003 it was the presidential election

855
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,560
etc etc

856
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,280
i'm sure i reported on it at some point

857
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,079
a long time ago um

858
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,839
but there was one other thing

859
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,320
so basically when i saw that take place

860
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,599
back

861
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,680
almost 20 years ago

862
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,359
i realized that

863
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,320
it appeared to will be a test run for

864
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,800
what you're describing that is much more

865
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,640
sophisticated and um

866
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
there's not much

867
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,760
of a separation between the united

868
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,440
states government and the south korean

869
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,480
government

870
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,800
basically it's almost one in the same

871
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,240
but um

872
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,560
oh uh the last thing you said was to

873
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,040
always fact check the content that you

874
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,520
run into online and i

875
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,320
encourage people to do that all the time

876
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
and a lot of people say okay i'll google

877
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,160
it and i said no don't google it fact

878
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,720
check it and um

879
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
i would give them some instruction to

880
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,640
help them

881
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
fact check without using google but i

882
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
would ask what would your advice to

883
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,680
somebody

884
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,480
who was ready to push the google button

885
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
but we don't want them to we want them

886
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,560
to actually fact check it with something

887
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,640
more legitimate what is the generic

888
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
means of fact checking or that you'd

889
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,000
suggest

890
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
well the best source to get information

891
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,079
from if it's about something a person

892
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,640
said is to see what they actually said

893
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,880
so if you see an article saying that

894
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,920
pinkie pie said so and so about rainbow

895
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,599
dash go and see if she actually said it

896
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,400
whether that being in like

897
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,480
in her twitter post like her actual

898
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,960
legitimate account or if she said

899
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,079
something in an actual interview and she

900
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,440
verbally said it um see

901
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,240
what she said from her from the direct

902
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,439
account of her own

903
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,320
voice engines or other sources would you

904
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,240
recommend

905
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,640
official sources just like i said

906
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,320
even though my example was a personal

907
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,079
source that also works for

908
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,760
broad source

909
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,040
sources and like actual newspapers that

910
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,320
are

911
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,480
a bigger deal because if you find some

912
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
newspaper that looks like kind of

913
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,720
sketchy i would check and see if any

914
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,760
other like big newspaper

915
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,000
new york times i i don't read newspapers

916
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,359
i'm not that old

917
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,078
new york times

918
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,839
new york times and like big things that

919
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,200
have been around forever see what

920
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
they're saying and obviously see both

921
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,800
sides and see what they're saying as

922
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,200
well i'd like to

923
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,960
add to that um

924
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,680
so if you notice a lot of news channels

925
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,000
are actually swayed one way or the other

926
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,079
uh when i'm watching the elections i

927
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,480
actually watch bbc

928
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
try and get an a

929
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
non-partisan uh

930
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,240
act to that um

931
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,280
so uh outside of uh and this is a

932
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
question that's coming in through matrix

933
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,839
um

934
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:34,800
is there a difference between a

935
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,920
political ad and a psy app uh like

936
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,040
cambridge analytic head run

937
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,800
there is kind of a difference one of

938
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,040
them the political ad is

939
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,319
meant for

940
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,960
to be a political ad to get somewhere

941
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,760
with

942
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,599
an election like to either make someone

943
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,640
lose or make someone win a psyops attack

944
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,520
can be

945
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,440
spreading information about anything

946
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,960
like i mentioned before vaccines

947
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,040
are there any

948
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,200
specific sites to ensure that news

949
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,160
sources are trustworthy

950
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,880
uh like mentioned bbc but i can't really

951
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,800
say like this side or this side because

952
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,119
all news is

953
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,280
cited everyone has their own opinion

954
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,960
people writing the news articles are

955
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,319
people and we'll

956
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,480
mention things that they want to mention

957
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,319
not everything that a person has said we

958
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,200
have a live question over here

959
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,960
uh yeah yeah sorry uh outstanding

960
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,560
presentation very well done just wanted

961
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
to make you aware there is a series now

962
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520
that just got released a month or two

963
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
ago on netflix it's called web of make

964
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
believe it's six episodes long you will

965
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,119
love it okay

966
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,480
you should all check that out yeah of

967
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,160
course everybody web of make believe it

968
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,720
is right up your alley

969
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,839
so another question um given the war in

970
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,599
ukraine and russia or between ukraine

971
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,920
and russia um there's been a lot about

972
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,079
what um

973
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,240
putin has been saying to his own people

974
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,160
internally have you done any research on

975
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,960
that or looked into that and see

976
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,800
how he's using psychological warfare

977
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,040
internally against his own people i have

978
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,720
looked at some things i didn't add

979
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,480
anything in this talk since the war is

980
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,200
still present and going on as we speak

981
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,800
so i'd rather do a talk on it in the

982
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,960
future once i know the full story um of

983
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,160
course putin has his own opinions and

984
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,599
information that he's telling his

985
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,359
followers and of course they believe it

986
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,960
because it's their

987
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,520
head of the board

988
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
so they might not get access to outside

989
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,960
information and think that what he's

990
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,520
doing is right but opinions

991
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,440
are very different like

992
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,960
depending on what side of things you're

993
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,319
on you think you're right you think

994
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,760
you're the good guy

995
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,280
even though the other side might think

996
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
you're the bad guy and vice versa great

997
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,119
we have another question right over here

998
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,200
what tools do you recommend to somebody

999
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,118
trying to run their own psyops campaign

1000
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,319
okay

1001
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,640
as long as you don't do anything like

1002
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,319
really bad

1003
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,520
um

1004
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,160
of course uh there's

1005
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,760
with a psyops campaign in general

1006
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
there's the news articles and stuff like

1007
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,680
i said everyone uses social media so

1008
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,319
implement social media make an account

1009
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,400
on all the big things make sure

1010
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,240
everything you make looks realistic

1011
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,880
unlike those poorly photoshopped things

1012
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,400
even though people still believe that

1013
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,839
they'll believe something that's more

1014
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,400
well thought out and like in the psyops

1015
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,119
campaign that we made together here with

1016
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,280
the unicorns they had different sources

1017
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,000
like a podcast and a news article and

1018
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,920
social media they're using other forms

1019
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,319
so it seems more backed up than just one

1020
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,440
account

1021
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
you have a question right here yep

1022
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,680
i just wanted to know if you had heard

1023
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,040
about the

1024
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,680
election that took place in the

1025
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,640
philippines which was uh

1026
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,599
basically the use the the winning

1027
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,079
candidate was the son of the former

1028
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,280
dictator for

1029
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,359
marcos and his son bongbong

1030
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,400
marcos that's his real name uh one

1031
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,200
because he did you he did post an

1032
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,119
extreme number of lies using social

1033
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,000
media but it was largely directed to the

1034
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,960
younger generation mostly which was not

1035
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,560
a lot mostly were born after his uh born

1036
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,800
after the father's dictatorship so there

1037
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,720
were lies for example that

1038
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,200
during his father's

1039
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,760
during his father's administration

1040
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,480
philippine philippines had the highest

1041
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,640
growth in gdp during that time except

1042
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,839
for japan which is absolutely absurd uh

1043
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,240
so i just wanted to point out that it's

1044
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,640
not just an older generation but also

1045
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,920
it was targeted to the young the massive

1046
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,880
younger voters uh and they pretty much

1047
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,280
bought it and he did win the election

1048
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,160
overwhelmingly the thing with that is

1049
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,240
the older voters tend to just do what

1050
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,440
they've done their whole lives and

1051
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,040
they're not easily changed they're like

1052
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,960
my way is the right way

1053
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,640
but the younger voters are still trying

1054
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,800
to figure themselves out and figure out

1055
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,400
what their opinions are so they end up

1056
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
being the persuadables so

1057
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,839
they're pretty smart to target the young

1058
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,760
generation especially at a young age

1059
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,000
that's already like put in their brain

1060
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,160
as they grow up and develop it's pretty

1061
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,560
scary

1062
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,440
okay so uh

1063
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,760
it's my turn yeah okay so on the

1064
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,000
notification everything as you mentioned

1065
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,720
i just wanted to point out that the

1066
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,440
report of an ira urban iraqi baghdad

1067
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,000
bhagti who told gis that bart simpson

1068
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,200
was seducing

1069
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,359
their wives was actually a joke made up

1070
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,000
by johnny carson that was incorrectly

1071
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,480
reported by a number of news outlets

1072
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,280
okay got it

1073
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,640
i wanted to address the issue of fact

1074
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,200
checking because

1075
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,920
um as a former educator

1076
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,880
i would say go to the source wherever

1077
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,760
possible and that's a lot easier

1078
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,800
than most people think i mean there are

1079
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,280
lots of statistics online there there

1080
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,440
are newspapers but if you don't feel

1081
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,599
comfortable with newspapers

1082
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,160
always go to the source so i'm going to

1083
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,000
just give an example

1084
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
for some reason in this country people

1085
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,240
act like for example the constitution is

1086
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,400
some type of secret document that nobody

1087
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,160
can read

1088
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,800
and one day i was teaching government

1089
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,079
and we were talking about who's

1090
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,640
qualified to be president

1091
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,720
and a young lady my class said well it

1092
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,480
says there in the constitution you have

1093
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,920
to be christian i said no honey it

1094
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,760
doesn't say that

1095
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,800
and

1096
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,240
i said listen i'm not going to argue

1097
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,040
with you but here's this we have books

1098
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,000
there's a copy of the constitution

1099
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,920
look you know you know looking article

1100
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,079
through yourself and she looked at it

1101
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,599
and she said

1102
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,520
you know it doesn't say that i said well

1103
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,599
let this be a lesson for you check for

1104
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,800
yourself

1105
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,720
don't rely especially if you have a

1106
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,040
document that you can go to stop i don't

1107
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,800
know why where people get some of their

1108
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,400
ideas from

1109
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,560
exactly that's that's a really good

1110
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
point that you put up

1111
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,960
and another thing with that is when

1112
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,359
reading a news article you can kind of

1113
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,359
spot if it's opinionated like if it's

1114
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,119
in a certain person the way that the

1115
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,960
author is writing it it's like i think

1116
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,720
that blah blah

1117
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
or if he even says like he thinks that

1118
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,559
he's so cool

1119
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,319
you don't know what he thinks just try

1120
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,720
to see if it's more solid facts or if

1121
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,720
it's the author saying

1122
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,800
his or her own opinion

1123
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,720
so i have a question on matrix and thank

1124
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,640
you for the online folks who are

1125
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,240
engaging with these questions on the

1126
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,520
slide showing the ad campaigns

1127
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,880
demographic targets and payment

1128
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,480
information where did that information

1129
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,079
come from was that from facebook twitter

1130
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,760
official disclosure or other

1131
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,680
intelligence sources open or closed do

1132
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,040
you have recommended sources for

1133
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,160
researching and add campaign financials

1134
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,920
ad campaign financials i'm not sure

1135
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,960
about the financial side of it um but

1136
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,559
i need to re-read that question yeah

1137
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,640
yeah

1138
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,760
all the information that i talked about

1139
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,720
is open there are supreme court cases

1140
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,160
that have talked about it between

1141
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,079
cambridge and facebook themselves that

1142
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,319
you can look up and watch

1143
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,200
there's a bunch of different

1144
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,040
documentaries on it i think it was on

1145
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,880
netflix it's like a six-hour documentary

1146
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,640
that i sat through that's really good

1147
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,880
and talks about all of cambridge and how

1148
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,800
it started and how it ended and it also

1149
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,680
focuses on the whistleblowers and their

1150
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,480
experience within the company

1151
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
so i would look into that as for payment

1152
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,559
and financial stuff i'm definitely no

1153
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,160
expert in that and i would do research

1154
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,400
all right so you had said that the older

1155
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,200
generation uh tends to be more gullible

1156
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,640
in believing news sources and news

1157
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,720
websites that are not true and like you

1158
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,240
know a lot of people in this room may

1159
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,920
not believe it but you know your grandma

1160
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,240
may believe that news source and uh how

1161
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,839
would you square this circle with the

1162
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,440
fact that that is often the same

1163
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,680
demographic that will say this is fake

1164
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,200
news i don't believe this or just

1165
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,680
believe virtually any say i'm not going

1166
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,040
to believe this because it seems very

1167
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,480
establishment and how much of this has

1168
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,400
to do with like not just tricking people

1169
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,520
into believing something but just

1170
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,880
telling them what they wanted to believe

1171
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,040
already and them just accepting it

1172
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,960
regardless of how it was delivered the

1173
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,280
thing is that with the older voters

1174
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
their mindset has already pretty much

1175
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,200
been made since they were younger once

1176
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,040
they were persuadable and someone told

1177
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,359
them about one side they're like yes

1178
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,839
pinkie pie is it she's the one she's the

1179
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,800
good one so if someone makes a news

1180
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,920
article about something that

1181
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,800
pinkie pie said that is

1182
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,520
fake they might still believe it because

1183
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,079
if it's goes with their values and their

1184
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,240
beliefs they'll believe it if it goes

1185
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,240
against their values and beliefs they're

1186
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,559
also gonna believe that that person said

1187
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,960
it like well pinkie pie's always right

1188
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,520
so twilight sparkle is the bad one so if

1189
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
i see an article that twilight sparkle

1190
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,599
is gonna

1191
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,440
start a thing that raids the capital

1192
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,640
then it's going to happen you know

1193
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,400
we have a question over here yeah so for

1194
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,400
so for the people who have firmly

1195
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,960
believed that you know hillary is truly

1196
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,000
a critical that unicorns are real how do

1197
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,520
you recommend

1198
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,359
like if someone like that in your life

1199
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,000
or even like just a stranger what is the

1200
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,240
best way that you found to

1201
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,720
convince that person that this belief

1202
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,880
that he or she has

1203
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,599
you know in her in his or her mind and

1204
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,160
it's not true it's not real what is the

1205
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,440
best way

1206
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,800
to give real information to change this

1207
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,720
person's mind

1208
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,720
when approaching them definitely don't

1209
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,160
like seem like you're attacking them

1210
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,400
like well that's wrong you know or

1211
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
anything like that make sure you just

1212
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,160
say like hey but i saw this and this and

1213
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,079
point them towards the actual source

1214
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,240
like we were talking about before

1215
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,839
um that like in this interview they said

1216
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,160
and i quote and i can send you the video

1217
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,800
that unicorns are real

1218
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,119
so just point them to the direct source

1219
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,880
and just kind of open it like hey but i

1220
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,400
thought you know instead of being like

1221
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,720
well that's wrong i have a follow-up

1222
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,800
question and on the larger level as like

1223
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,040
citizens of you know this country all of

1224
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,520
the world what is the best way we can do

1225
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,640
to just

1226
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,720
stop this because it seems like this is

1227
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,119
going to scale like every country every

1228
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,359
politician is already looking into this

1229
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,960
and doing this

1230
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,240
and this it seems unsustainable but you

1231
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,480
know they probably don't care they don't

1232
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,319
care what can we do on a larger level

1233
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,960
there this is scary but there's no way

1234
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,960
to stop at this point as long as social

1235
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,040
media and computers and the internet is

1236
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,720
a thing but one way we can do this to

1237
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,440
prevent it is educating people like i

1238
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,680
have done here explaining like there are

1239
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,440
fake news sites and just like older

1240
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,119
generation younger generation making

1241
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,160
posts about how to stay safe online how

1242
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,800
to fact check things and to fact check

1243
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,359
things just educating people to do their

1244
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,359
own research and information

1245
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,760
finding that's the way to do it

1246
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,520
cool so we're out of time if you have

1247
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,640
other questions bsi lab will be outside
