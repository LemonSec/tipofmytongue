1
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,760
all right welcome everyone to our two

2
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
o'clock session

3
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,280
um just a reminder

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
that uh put your phones on vibrate

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
we have exits in the case of emergency

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,119
look for someone with a radio or a blue

7
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,600
volunteer shirt

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
stay hydrated it's hot today and

9
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,960
you know have fun right now i'd like to

10
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,759
introduce davide semenzen uh and he's

11
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,200
going to be talking about why building

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
digital libraries matters thank you have

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
a day

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,759
oh wow the lights are bright hey

15
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,840

thank you

17
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,960
all right

18
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,159
ah of course one sec

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
oh okay whatever i'll freestyle this

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,159
all right

21
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
hey everybody thank you for coming um my

22
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,759
name is davide

23
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,040
i

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,600
am a software engineer by trade i

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
studied computer science

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
like many of you i guess

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,520
i spent most of my career working in

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
distributed systems

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,240
i currently work at aws but i spent

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
a good chunk

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
of about five years working at the

32
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,560
the internet archive

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,239
and there i worked building the

34
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,400
platform to digitize books

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
at scale and

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
it's work that

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
i think about a lot and i think it's uh

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,239
um it's very meaningful to me and so um

39
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,040
while i remain um associated with the

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,280
archive i also just always really liked

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
books and i always really cared about

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
libraries and the humanities and so i

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,599
don't know if these are credentials

44
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,519
enough but you know we're all here we'll

45
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
try to make it fun and i have a statue

46
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
the internet archive is a non-profit

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,560
organization so they don't have stock

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
options to give you so after three years

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
you stay there they make a little statue

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
of you and that's mine holding that this

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
is fine dog

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
anyway

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,840
so i'm here today to talk to you about

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,120
building digital libraries and

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
okay let's get real like you saw the

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,440
title of this talk you're all here

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,879
and that means that in a sense you

58
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,400
wanted to engage with this idea of a

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
digital library so it's a real question

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
i'm asking you what's a library

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,840
what

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,720
what do you think a library is

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,200
i really want to hear it

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,159
any takers

65
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,280
you can use printer your library that's

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
awesome

67
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
um

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,720
3d printer

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,239
a website with all the books that's

70
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,159
really good i like your notion of the

71
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,599
library go ahead go ahead

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
exactly it's a place where you can

73
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
retrieve things that is well organized

74
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,640
actually that is as close to my

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,440
definition as it gets i think it's an

76
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
accessible and organized collection of

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,640
materials

78
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
i think accessible is more important

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
than organized libraries

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
it's better if they are organized but

81
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
they really have to be accessible

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
otherwise they're just collections

83
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,920
and

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,879
it's important that they are a

85
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,720
collection of materials not just of

86
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,879
stuff otherwise a landfill would be a

87
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,799
library right like it there has to be

88
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,358
some inerrant value in in whatever it is

89
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,519
that that we're collecting

90
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,478
um

91
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,880
and so i i want to try and answer this

92
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,479
question of

93
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,880
why do digital libraries matter

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
by going through a couple of other

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,680
questions you know in a way asking why

96
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
of anything is a little bit of a

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,360
philosophical question right which is

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
just a fancy way of saying that you have

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
to answer a whole bunch of other

100
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,520
questions before you get there and so

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
we have a working notion of what is a

102
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
what is a library and we're going to

103
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,120
come back to this

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
the next question would be who builds

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
libraries and

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
you know

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
you can think of your

108
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
classic library like your library down

109
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
the street uh that's the library you can

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
think of the library um in maybe high

111
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
school or university or your law firm or

112
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
the internet archive uh private

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
libraries are libraries as well and you

114
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,759
know people have been building libraries

115
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
since the dawn of time so the ecosystem

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
is is really robust

117
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
uh there are government and

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919
government-like entities building

119
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,479
libraries um almost every country has a

120
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,120
national library and

121
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
well then there are companies companies

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
companies have libraries but aren't

123
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,120
necessarily libraries if you think of a

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,680
certain search engine who spent

125
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
a very significant amount of money

126
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,720
building a very large digital collection

127
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,759
of books uh they're not really a library

128
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,360
because they're not accessible

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,759
the collection exists but it is not it

130
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,520
success it is accessed on their own

131
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
terms maybe a snippet at a time maybe

132
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,080
pay for play maybe not at all

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,039
so um i'm kind of on the verge about on

134
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,319
that one but we're going to put it in

135
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,319
there and then there is you there's like

136
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
me you we have like a cell phone your

137
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,960
cell phone is a digital library in

138
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,919
in this world we're all engaging in in

139
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,919
in the creation of of digital libraries

140
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,639
so this matters for a variety of reasons

141
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,880
and not the least of it is that you're

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,400
taking part in it whether you like it or

143
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,280
not

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
so of all of the people who are are

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
engaging willingly or unwillingly in the

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,039
construction of digital libraries i

147
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
think the internet archive um is maybe

148
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,600
one of one of the the most important or

149
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
certainly notable

150
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,240
examples and if you do not know what the

151
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
internet archive is um

152
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
the top of the line uh description is

153
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
that it is a digital library that has

154
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,840
existed for about 26 years i think it

155
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
was 1996 right may 10th 1996.

156
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,479
and it is known for

157
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,680
this one

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
um

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,639
pretty amazing piece of software called

160
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,720
the wayback machine where you can go

161
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
back in time and see what websites look

162
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
like before they inevitably change or

163
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
disappear

164
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,759
and it is headquartered in this

165
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,400
beautiful building in san francisco it

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,479
used to be a christ scientist church and

167
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,400
i kid you not the reason we bought it is

168
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
because it looked like our logo this is

169
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,919
a true story um

170
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
anyway i it

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,880
a lot of things work that way um so

172
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,280
i i don't want to dwell too long on uh

173
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,199
what the archive is because there is

174
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
like somebody else who can do it a lot

175
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,199
better and that oops and that is

176
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,520
archive.org so just visit the website

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
all the stuff is in there whole hundred

178
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,800
petabytes of it

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,599
um

180
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
really um

181
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,880
i want to move on to what i think uh is

182
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
maybe like the closest part to my heart

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
which is really the how because i'm an

184
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,639
engineer and i spent many years of my

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
life building

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
uh the tool to build the library so the

187
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
question of how do you build a library

188
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,960
with purpose at a certain scale well i

189
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
can answer that and

190
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
it's pipeline it's not very surprising

191
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,759
so i'm going to talk about this only a

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
little bit

193
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
i'm going to leave time at the end for

194
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
questions so i can maximize my chances

195
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,400
of saying something that is of interest

196
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,840
to you guys

197
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,759
but at a high level

198
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
there are just two boxes there is a

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,479
purple box that's stuff that happens um

200
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,919
on the scanner

201
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,360
in the world there are hundreds of the

202
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,080
scanners scattered all over the world

203
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
and the blue stuff is what happens

204
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,120
inside

205
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,319
our

206
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,280
call it cloud so

207
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
the way this works is that we start with

208
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
a scanner we

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
receive a book and then we have to

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
somehow transform it into a digital

211
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
artifact well the first step is to take

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,719
pictures of it and so we have devised

213
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,159
these these

214
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,360
devices these are all built by us all

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
developed by us um

216
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,279
some of them um

217
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
like in different eras

218
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
and they all cater to different use

219
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
cases

220
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
you have this full frame scribe

221
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,519
it's a very large kind of contraption

222
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,380
it's got a

223
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,480
[Music]

224
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
very big cradle so you use this for very

225
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,440
large books that have maybe a difficult

226
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
spines like dictionaries and stuff like

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
that um

228
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
it's also very good for um for

229
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
digitizing very delicate delicate

230
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,880
objects

231
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,320
we have a mandate of doing

232
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
non-destructive scanning which makes

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,760
things a little more complicated than if

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,279
you could just like rip the spine off

235
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,760
and turn this into a

236
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,800
just a

237
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,080
page turning exercise um

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
there aren't so many of these full-frame

239
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
scribes they're very expensive they're

240
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,560
they're custom built they're bulky

241
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
our real blockbuster is the tabletop

242
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
scribe we built a lot of these and all

243
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,240
of these are built off of consumer

244
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
hardware consumer cameras

245
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
they're easy to manufacture they're easy

246
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
to transport

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
and they provide uh pretty high quality

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
uh and then so we use these for really

249
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
like the mass digitization stuff um and

250
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
then there is like the fold out scribe

251
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,839
which is like this table with a

252
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
glorified table with a camera really uh

253
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,040
but the camera is very precisely

254
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,640
positioned and it's very very high

255
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,839
quality

256
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
and so you use this for maps atlases uh

257
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,560
things of that sort like really large

258
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
format

259
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
anyway so

260
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
i put this light in here it's really not

261
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,920
that important but this is the software

262
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,360
that i spent five years developing so i

263
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
just figured like it should be in the

264
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
presentation

265
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,760
this is just the software that we use

266
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
right we run on the scanners and what it

267
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,519
really does is um it collates a bunch of

268
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,880
different functions together it's kind

269
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
of like a swiss army knife of of book

270
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
scanning um it can

271
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,800
process metadata load data um try to

272
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
figure out if there are errors in the in

273
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
the way the book was scanned before we

274
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,800
send it

275
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
and then ultimately takes care of

276
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
uploading to to the archive and i'm

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
going to come back to these themes later

278
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,279
because

279
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,399
none of that is actually simple anyway

280
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,560
after we

281
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
have successfully uploaded all of the

282
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,079
data in the archive a bunch of stuff

283
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,480
starts happening that's kind of cool so

284
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
first we

285
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,399
pre-process all of this stuff so we

286
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
disqueue it we autocrop it we make sure

287
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
that we have all of the derivative

288
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,120
formats for images so that we can we can

289
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,560
move to the next step which i'm going to

290
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
talk about in a second and then

291
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
generally like we

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,240
modify the structural metadata so that

293
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,399
we have a an easy to modify book and

294
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,200
the reason that matters is because we

295
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,160
have um a sort of human in the loop

296
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,320
stage called republishing

297
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
and that is when a human actually

298
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,440
revises what the automation has done and

299
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
make sure that the book is good and that

300
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
everything has been like worked out

301
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,399
properly

302
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,440
and

303
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
it uses like another

304
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,320
piece of homegrown software like this

305
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
and sometimes you know at this stage we

306
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,440
find errors and there is this like

307
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
really painful rigamarole that we need

308
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,480
to go through to send back the book to

309
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,600
the original scanner where it was

310
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,680
originated fix it it's very expensive

311
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,959
very complicated it's borderline magic

312
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
so so

313
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,440
so weird it is but anyway

314
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,160
uh

315
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,639
provided that the human says okay

316
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,519
everything looks good um it the book is

317
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,519
checked in and we move into a

318
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,399
post-processing phase where um

319
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,200
we

320
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
actually apply all of those crops and

321
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,560
those disqueues and all those

322
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
transformations um and we do a bunch of

323
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,519
other

324
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,720
metadata

325
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,440
extraction on the images and um color

326
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
correction all this sort of stuff and

327
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,279
then

328
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,399
the output of the stage is um a set of

329
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,720
files plus a description of the

330
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,880
structure of the book plus the metadata

331
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,440
and then from here we derive all of the

332
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,240
other formats that we we distribute pdf

333
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,279
epub text we ocr it i'm going to talk

334
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,959
about ocr later

335
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,760
anyway and so this is how you end with a

336
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
digital book in short if you guys want

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
to know like more details we can talk

338
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,880
about this at the end so just kind of

339
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
like at a high level what the building

340
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,600
blocks are

341
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,839
so what's kind of interesting about

342
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,440
this whole thing is

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,279
what was hard about it and

344
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,320
i entirely arbitrarily divided the

345
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,639
challenges that we had into

346
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,240
whether they pertain to the bits or

347
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,399
whether they pertain to the atoms

348
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,880
so in terms of the bits what i call the

349
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
logical challenges um

350
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
if you if any of you have worked for any

351
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,800
length of time on distributed systems

352
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
this is not going to come as a big

353
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
surprise but

354
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,240
in a highly process oriented environment

355
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,560
catching and correcting errors as soon

356
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
as possible is of critical importance

357
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,519
because

358
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,519
from the moment an error is made and the

359
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,920
page is turned a clock starts ticking

360
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
and with every passing second correcting

361
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,760
that error becomes more expensive

362
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,160
i talked about this rigmarole that we

363
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,079
have to go through if we figure out i

364
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,560
don't know two three four days later

365
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,120
that a book that was scanned has a page

366
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
uh that was blurry or something you know

367
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,639
you have to go figure out where that

368
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,160
book is figure out what the pages takes

369
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,399
like a lot of time

370
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,360
metadata curation also um

371
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,279
kind of a kind of a thorny problem

372
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,240
mostly because

373
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
books are

374
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
and this is a

375
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,279
this is a theme that will come back

376
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,279
books are an expression of human

377
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,880
endeavors and so they are very very

378
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,160
different from each other they don't

379
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
follow a schema and computers really

380
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,480
like schemas and so sometimes it's

381
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
really difficult to wrangle things that

382
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,399
way it's um and obviously you have to

383
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,959
maintain large databases of

384
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
of metadata and burst or hate databases

385
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,839
anyway

386
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
maybe one of the biggest

387
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
real challenges that we had and by real

388
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
i mean

389
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,000
stuff that

390
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,320
will ruin your day if it doesn't work

391
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,440
was this problem of delivering um

392
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,800
industrial

393
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,760
level process reliability over what it

394
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
is fundamentally in a reliable back end

395
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
and so let me talk about this for a

396
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,160
second

397
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
there are very good reasons why the

398
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
internet archive is quote unquote

399
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,880
unreliable

400
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
i think that by my estimation the

401
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,720
internet archive is available 99.9

402
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
of the year which is a whole lot better

403
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,279
than your average library which is

404
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,320
available hardly 50 of the time um but

405
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
for a digital native 99.9 is not so

406
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,560
great and so i mean i think if you talia

407
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
talia at the end of the year like the

408
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,800
archive maybe was offline for an hour a

409
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,639
year but it's not continuous it's in

410
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,600
blips

411
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,639
and

412
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,240
if you're borrowing a book

413
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,320
that really doesn't matter that much

414
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
sorry

415
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,839
but if you're trying to upload a book

416
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
it starts really really disrupting your

417
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
process and as it turns out you know

418
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
people who do book scanning

419
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,480
i mean that's their job and if people

420
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
cannot do their job they don't get paid

421
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
if they don't get paid they rightfully

422
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
get very angry and so we had to figure

423
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,720
out a way to make sure that

424
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
all of this system that we had devised

425
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,279
kept running even when you know if the

426
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,959
archive became a big hole in the ground

427
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,639
for a while

428
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,399
and again if you have worked on

429
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,160
distributed systems for any amount of

430
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,199
time

431
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,800
the kind of solutions that we came up

432
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
with they're not particularly

433
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
groundbreaking it's like a lot of

434
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,600
retries a lot of back off lots of

435
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
caching everywhere um but it would

436
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
surprise me in retrospect how much time

437
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
i i spent trying to

438
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,240
um you know fix this kind of problems oh

439
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,399
another error like something that really

440
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,279
plagued me was people who put error

441
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,399
messages inside the 200 okay

442
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,759
don't do that

443
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
anyway networking was also a big big

444
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
problem at times like if you're beaming

445
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,079
like very large amounts of data over the

446
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
open internet at some point somebody

447
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
something is bound to go wrong and

448
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
sometimes like something goes wrong in

449
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,959
in

450
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,800
an aes that's completely outside of your

451
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,839
control so what do you do

452
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
build all caching mostly uh but again

453
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,319
like this is not particularly surprising

454
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,880
the stuff about

455
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
atoms like about the physical world was

456
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,559
like what to me was the newest because

457
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
as a software engineer i am not really

458
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,039
used i think i have

459
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
some difficulty uh dealing with the fact

460
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,760
that the physical world has constraints

461
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
um and so you know if you're scanning

462
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
any amount of books you have to move

463
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,440
them around and they're bulky and

464
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
they're heavy so you need like

465
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,960
pallets and boxes and forklifts and

466
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
containers and like uh it's it's a whole

467
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
thing and you have to keep track of

468
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
where everything is

469
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,720
you need to write software for that

470
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,480
obviously

471
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
but you know

472
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,000
software kind of assumes like an

473
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
idealized version of the world and

474
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
sometimes the world doesn't behave that

475
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
way so you know book disposition was a

476
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,880
problem at some point where is stuff

477
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,559
hard hard problem

478
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
um i'm gonna come back to this but the

479
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
what i pompously call call the

480
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
variability of the input space really

481
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
means that books come in all sorts of

482
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,880
really wacky formats like a lot and

483
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,720
very quickly whatever assumption you

484
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
make about a book other than it exists

485
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,880
is going to be proven wrong at some

486
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
point it's crazy

487
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,520
sometimes books are just broken

488
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,039
pages are missing

489
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
there is ambiguity about how to deal

490
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
with them sometimes they

491
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
they have pop-ups fold-outs all sort of

492
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,600
things um that like will make them um

493
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
not fit in our scanners

494
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
um and then i kind of put it here in the

495
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,360
physical world because like mostly like

496
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,799
stuff like fails physically but i i

497
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,400
mentioned that we built this stuff out

498
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
of consumer hardware and consumer

499
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
hardware is consumer hardware and

500
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,400
sometimes it does not behave as

501
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,679
advertised or sometimes it doesn't

502
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,200
behave at all

503
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,840
so surprising how much time i had to

504
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
spend debugging drivers

505
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,919
more than i cared but

506
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,080
so it is what it is

507
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
so

508
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
now that i'm here and i have a pulpit i

509
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,440
actually want to address a little pet

510
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
peeve of mine so a couple of years ago

511
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,720
maybe a couple of months ago maybe a

512
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
year ago this video made the rounds on

513
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,679
the internet and here you see eliza

514
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,200
she's awesome she works as a book

515
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
scanner at the san francisco scanning

516
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
center she's one of our best scanners

517
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,559
one of the fastest in fact i used to

518
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,720
to use her as a benchmark

519
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,480
she's an extremely

520
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,400
thorough and capable person and she's

521
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,039
really really good at her job so

522
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,440
this video made the rounds on twitter

523
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,679
and if you've not if you if you have not

524
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,200
been on twitter what you need to know

525
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,880
about twitter is that twitter is a place

526
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,360
for nuance where uh everybody's very

527
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
calm and where everybody really takes

528
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
their time thinking about what they're

529
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,840
about to say

530
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,039
um and so when they saw this video there

531
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,480
is like

532
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
there is a particular type of tech bro

533
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
who will not

534
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
be able to resist the temptation of

535
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
optimizing as a thing that he just

536
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,960
learned the existence of and it's

537
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
invariably a dude

538
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
and so it's the kind of person who will

539
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,200
say oops

540
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,960
why isn't this automated

541
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,760
why do you have a person and this really

542
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,480
really annoys me to no end and so i just

543
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
want to talk about this for a second

544
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,200
because the fact that we have a person

545
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,760
in there that is not a coincidence it's

546
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,919
not because a robot could could do it

547
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,840
better so first of all

548
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
there are

549
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,400
if you where to put a robot where that

550
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
person is

551
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,120
well first of all you have to account

552
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,440
for this i mentioned books they come in

553
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
all sorts of shape they're they're big

554
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
they are heavy they are bulky some of

555
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
them are fluffy some of them are tiny

556
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,559
some of them have fallouts some of them

557
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,480
have pop-ups

558
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,880
some of them this happened to me have

559
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,440
tomato sauce in the cover

560
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,159
this is only this is a real thing um

561
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,919
it's a good lack of automating that like

562
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,200
give a computer

563
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
give a robot to the uh the task of

564
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
turning that and then you know texts are

565
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,520
not just books i i talk about books a

566
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,480
lot but um these are uh

567
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
palm leafs inscripted palm leaves from

568
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,320
bali this is still a very common type of

569
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
of medium in southeast asia and you know

570
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,080
this very valuable text we want to be

571
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
able to digitize it it's a text we must

572
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,840
be able to digitize it we designed the

573
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
system to digitize everything

574
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,200
there is no point in trying to automate

575
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
this

576
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,960
and

577
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,039
actually

578
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
it's not just that there is no point

579
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,440
trying to automate it

580
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,080
a person does a lot more than what you

581
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,679
see a person does a lot more than

582
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
turning pages a person

583
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,080
disambiguates ambiguity

584
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,480
a person can figure out when metadata is

585
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,799
wrong a person

586
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,720
a person in the slope

587
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,039
is a feature it is not a bug

588
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,880
and if you actually want to run the

589
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
numbers i will not run the numbers here

590
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,200
for you but if you actually want to

591
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
automate say okay i don't care about the

592
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,039
palm leaves i don't care about like the

593
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
the tomato sauce i only care about

594
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
harmony books and like you know tiny

595
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,120
little paperbacks uh i just want to scan

596
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,799
those well

597
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,679
uh

598
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,880
there's only two things you can do

599
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,120
either you build your own um

600
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
entire automated solution good luck

601
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,280
building a robot

602
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,520
um or you just get something off the

603
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,799
shelf and there are a few commercial

604
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,640
vendors and they like

605
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
uh if you actually run the numbers what

606
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
comes out is that the only metric that

607
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,080
automation at this scale improves is

608
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,880
cost so

609
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,480
and since we're on the topic of pet

610
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
peeves

611
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
people are sometimes somehow like i've

612
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
been asked about this all the time i

613
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,000
don't know why but people are super

614
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
fascinated with ocr um and unfortunately

615
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,960
i have i never have anything to say

616
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,039
because ocr to me was

617
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,799
for who doesn't know ocr is optical

618
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,360
character recognition is how you turn um

619
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,840
photos into like text files uh which is

620
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
very important but it is at least for uh

621
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,919
latin alphabet it is a solved problem i

622
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,640
never had to worry about ocr not working

623
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,320
ever so i'm sorry i don't know anything

624
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,400
about ocr i'm the wrong person to ask

625
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
anyway

626
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,480
so in terms of the the takeaways um

627
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,799
from uh you know how do you build a

628
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,080
digital libraries and then we can move

629
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
on to why

630
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,640
um

631
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,960
i think

632
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
i think what was hard

633
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
was not what i thought was gonna be hard

634
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
and what was actually hard i could never

635
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,159
even conceptualize um and so to me the

636
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,000
lesson is like maybe a pretty common one

637
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
but you know i guess it bears repeating

638
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,679
don't try to be too smart just like

639
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,840
iterate quickly you can never

640
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
kind of like really figure it all out in

641
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,360
your head before you actually try it um

642
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,320
anyway so this is how you build um a a

643
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,039
big library how you build like a digital

644
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,039
library of scale but i want to circle

645
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,279
back to this notion like what we started

646
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,240
is a library is you know a collection of

647
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,919
um of items that that have some value

648
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,720
and

649
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,240
the fact that i have spent some time

650
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,720
here talking about you know a big

651
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,640
pipeline and all of these scanners that

652
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,880
can digitize a lot of books

653
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,039
it makes

654
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,360
i don't want it to make it feel like

655
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,679
this is a game of numbers it certainly

656
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,679
is not a game and it is certainly not a

657
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,640
game of numbers um you will pardon my uh

658
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,600
romanticism here but

659
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,559
building a library is is is an act of

660
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,919
love it's like there is something

661
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,880
profoundly noble in wanting to preserve

662
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,400
knowledge for knowledge's sake and um

663
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,760
so i want to spend just a couple of

664
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,720
minutes

665
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
talking about

666
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,799
what is like what does this

667
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,320
look like at the end of the day because

668
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,640
we talked about the how but what is it

669
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,799
really so a digital library is the

670
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,760
ability for you at any minute of the day

671
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,240
to load up this beautiful edition of the

672
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
hypnarotomakia polyphili

673
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,559
this is a

674

about this do you know what this is

711
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,360
about maybe a hundred years before pete

712
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,640
mondrian

713
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
made these colors kind of mainstream

714
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
oliver byrne

715
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,320
a mathematician

716
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,960
published this this book where he used

717
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,279
the colors to elucidate

718
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,200
some concepts in

719
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
euclid's elements and this is just a

720
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
beautiful beautiful book and you can

access it anytime

722
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
or if you're feeling a little gory

723
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,919
you have this book about death it's a

724
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
dance of death there are like poems and

725
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,640
prose and illustration about death if

726
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
you're feeling so inclined is that not

727
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,919
morbid enough what about the old

728
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,360
testament

729
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,720
this pretty pretty beautiful edition

730
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,000
there's pretty beautiful edition of the

731
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,559
quran also this is i think from

732
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,799
early 1900s this was from uh i think 14

733
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,960
1599. um

734
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
also talk about the variability in books

735
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,559
this is left to right

736
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,520
um

737
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
screwed a whole bunch of stuff up when i

738
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,279
had to implement that

739
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,679
uh this is the divine comedy as verbose

740
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,760
as dante wanted it to be no i'm kidding

741
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,679
this is the this is just the um

742
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,960
introduction

743
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,520
the divine comedy is written in in rhyme

744
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,559
it looks pretty different but this is

745
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,320
like beautiful uh beautiful text uh or

746
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,480
what about this truck titus on how to

747
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,360
avoid a premature burial apparently in

748
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,279
the mid 1800s this was a concern

749
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,520
and you know why do digital libraries

750
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
matter also because like

751
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,440
our memories are short and sometimes we

752
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
forget some of the weird ideas that we

753
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,880
have or some of the bad ideas that we

754
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,360
have introducing this tractatus on

755
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,320
phrenology phrenology is the study of uh

756
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,240
the shape of the head to determine to

757
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,880
determine um the characteristics and the

758
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,399
character of a person

759
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,840
something that hopefully we move down

760
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
from

761
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,760
but you can access it

762
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
there's this beautiful oh yeah talk

763
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,039
about edgy this is a beautiful

764
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,559
beautiful book

765
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,760
it's a

766
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,080
it's a series of

767
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,879
thoughts from

768
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,640
american pilgrims in uh in brazil

769
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
uh

770
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,000
oh this oh this is pretty interesting

771
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
this is the first book about

772
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,640
cryptography it's from the early 1800s

773
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,520
so

774
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,960
to this crowd maybe pretty interesting

775
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,320
but i know what you really want

776
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,039

thai content that we have because i

794
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,799

795
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,799
thailand um so these are funerary books

796

from

797
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,279
uh from thailand so in uh um

798
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,720
the tradition is that when somebody gets

799
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,000
gets cremated um it's the day that

800
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,440
they're it's the last day that their

801
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,720
body exists in its uh um

802
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,559
you know known form

803
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,039
and uh it is tradition that for uh each

804
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,559
person that gets cremated the family or

805
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,600
the friends they get together and they

806
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,440
make a little book uh that kind of

807
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
contains a bunch of scriptures from uh

808
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,440
um from texts and it contains um just

809
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,279
like pictures and like a memory of

810
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,279
somebody's life and this is how they are

811
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
remembered and

812
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
um i mean if that wasn't amazing enough

813
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,000
in itself

814
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,720
my friend found

815
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,520
one of his ancestors in there and like

816
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,200
learned stuff

817
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,600
as i was preparing for this presentation

818
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,159
libraries in action you never know what

819
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,039
is what matters to whom but uh sure

820
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,640
enough this mattered the whole deal to

821
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,840
him

822
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,399
uh this was the the text in question

823
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,080
um or what about this these are um these

824
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
are books that were sent to us at the

825
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,320
archive from uh from a library in in

826
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,600
hong kong these are uh political descent

827
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,440
uh pamphlets things that you know

828
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
somebody has a vested interest to to

829
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,520
make sure disappear because they um they

830
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,679
they matter

831
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,120
and you know we talked about like the

832
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
palm the palm leaves um the internet

833
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
archive actually started a palm leaves

834
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,880
wiki where not only you find the

835
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
pictures that we have digitized they

836
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,559
also get transcribed

837
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,200
and they can be referenced and linked if

838
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,799
you're a researcher

839
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,960
palmleaf.org is where you can find this

840
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,799
pretty cool

841
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,760
and you know

842
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,000
a lot of these palm trees palm leaves

843
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,440
they come from bali

844
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,320
bali is pretty rock and roll they as a

845
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,480
country decided to go full digital and

846
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,200
so the the balinese digital library

847
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,720
is much bigger than just palm leaves

848
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
there are like all sorts of artifacts in

849
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,000
here

850
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,760
a library a digital library also means

851
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,480
that you you know um not only can travel

852
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
the world but like learn more about your

853
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
neighborhood this is uh the noi valley

854
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,880
voice it's a uh it's a local newspaper

855
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
from uh uh from where i live and we have

856
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,640
um all of the additions dating back to i

857
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,039
think the mid 70s

858
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,080
um

859
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,399
so you know okay i've shown you a bunch

860
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,080
of like cool uh little things uh and i i

861
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,399
want to talk about for a second uh

862
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,519
you know

863
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,720
what is a library we know it's a cool

864
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,320
it's organized and it's a collection of

865
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,240
all these cool things there is one thing

866
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,080
that i left out that is i think very

867
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,240
important about stress

868
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,200
who knows what this is

869
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,559
any takers mark knows what this is

870
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,760
this is the boston public library

871
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,519
this was created by

872
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,279
andrew carnegie certainly not a

873
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,399
communist

874
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,840
um

875
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,640
full expression of american

876
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
capitalism you know what it says on the

877
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,399
front

878
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,240
i took this picture about a month ago it

879
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,640
says free to all

880
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,279
free to oh the fact that the library is

881
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,240
free

882
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,200
is fundamental to the way it operates

883
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,760
free is a feature it's maybe even the

884
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
killer feature

885
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,159
so

886
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,360
i want to talk about why

887
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,799
free is important and it's in a way it's

888
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,120
part of what makes the library because

889
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,600
um there are

890
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
okay so first of all

891
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,360
there is a matter of equality uh

892
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,480
knowledge is not equally distributed and

893
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,039
sometimes you know this this inequality

894
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,159
um distribute uh false on on social

895
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,000
fault lines um

896
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,799
but with that resume um the role of the

897
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,559
library is to act as an equalizer

898
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,760
and

899
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,000
it cannot do that if if it's pay for

900
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
play it just simply cannot um

901
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,559
a library is also important um

902
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,399
it's important that it is free because

903
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,440
it means that it doesn't depend on the

904
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,080
the money of patterns to to exist and it

905
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,519
needs to exist because um

906
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,080
knowledge is easily lost

907
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,159
you remember what happened in alexandria

908
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,840
i mean we weren't there but we know

909
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,039
uh and

910
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,600
you know a library needs to celebrate

911
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
the diversity of

912
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,919
of of humankind um

913
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,720
and you cannot be tethered to uh to a

914
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,320
business model and do that like the

915
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,880
incentives they simply don't align

916
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,760
and ultimately

917
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
and i think in this day and age it is

918
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,079
particularly painfully obvious that we

919
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,520
need this but

920
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,800
a library is a repository of trust

921
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,040
and you know having texts that we can

922
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,480
trust having text the the um

923
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,960
having original sources uh that's really

924
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,639
really important

925
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,040
and so every li every library every free

926
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,159
public library uh fulfills um all of

927
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,440
these um all of these things but digital

928
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,800
libraries

929
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,918
fulfill even more and so we can finally

930
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,239
get to talk about why digital libraries

931
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,480
matters digital um and i want to propose

932
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,440
a few there's five of them five reasons

933
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,918
why the first one is that this is a

934
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,918
boosterism um

935
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,320
availability drives preservation which

936
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,480
means fundamentally if nobody uses it it

937
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,960
will be lost and

938
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,040
i'm gonna break news to you guys people

939
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
are on the internet

940
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,599
so

941
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,400
if

942
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,720
if we are to have a library it better be

943
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,079
on the internet because that's where

944
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,680
people look for things and if you cannot

945
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,920
find something functionally it's the

946
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,839
same as if it didn't exist and if it

947
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,880
doesn't exist it will be lost

948
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,079
and

949
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,480
in this sense availability is a forcing

950
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,280
function for preservation

951
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,400
although preservation is maybe the more

952
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,520
important of the two functions um

953
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,000
but i don't want to dwell on that

954
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,040
and so

955
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,359
digital libraries by virtue of existing

956
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,079
have the ability to perpetuate uh these

957
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,240
digital artifacts that are all so

958
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,440
important

959
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,640
um i put together a little um

960
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,720
a little diagram here uh

961
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,400
it turns out that physical and digital

962
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,119
artifacts have like specular properties

963
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,079
on

964
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,040
on many

965
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
um many dimensions some you know

966
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,880
i will break no ground saying that

967
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,400
sorry

968
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
a digital book is very easy to copy

969
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,520
whereas a

970
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,839
physical book is very hard to censor

971
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
physical books

972
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,880
require almost no energy they

973
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,960
rarely run out of battery

974
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,640
so you know

975
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,880
you could engage in the debate about oh

976
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
which one is better well that's not the

977
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,119
point the point is that these are two of

978
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,960
the same thing there are two sides of a

979
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,119
new coin you will if you

980
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,359
um

981
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,040
if you forgive my bellic metaphor i

982
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,200
think that we with ebooks we are in a

983
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,520
little bit of the same place or where we

984
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,480
where

985
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,839
when airplanes were first invented um

986
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,640
and used in war so at the beginning you

987
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
know airplanes were used for

988
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,560
reconnaissance and mostly for for

989
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,280
fighting the same war with a new tool uh

990
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
but over time what really became evident

991
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,000
is that airplanes are an entirely new

992
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,400
dimension and i i think with books we

993
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,680
are in a similar situation where this

994
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,280
new digital artifact and this

995
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,359
digital libraries that we're building

996
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,839
they really can offer features that were

997
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,320
unaccessible before even inconceivable

998
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,240
think about accessibility that doesn't

999
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
just mean you know scaling funds up and

1000
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,680
down and that's also very important

1001
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,720
means it means also really loud uh it

1002
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,280
means like the ability for uh for for

1003
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,040
people who are impaired in various ways

1004
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,720
to access materials

1005
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,280
and it also means the ability to access

1006
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
these items when you cannot physically

1007
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,000
go to the library and a lot of you in

1008
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,560
here are able-bodied but all of you in

1009
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
here live the true covid and at some

1010
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,680
point we

1011
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,359
we couldn't go to the library and this

1012
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,119
suddenly became really really important

1013
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,599
accessibility um

1014
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,599
and since we're not tethered to the

1015
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,760
atoms you know

1016
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,520
digital libraries can can really help

1017
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,720
there

1018
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,480
searching and indexing that's another

1019
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
fantastic feature like at the internet

1020
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,520
archive my friend giovanni implemented a

1021
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,760
full text search engine right now for

1022
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,359
free right this icon you can go to

1023
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,520
archive.org and in the homepage it lets

1024
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,119
you search

1025
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,119
the full text of 40

1026
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,920
50 however many million texts there is

1027
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
like patents and papers and books and

1028
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
what have you you can search all of that

1029
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,480
instantly for free right now this was

1030
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,400
to me this is mind-boggling still

1031
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
because i use this thing almost every

1032
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,440
day and whenever it works i'm like what

1033
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,839
it's i mean i also like know like how

1034
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,480
much goes into making this system but

1035
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
the fact that we can realistically have

1036
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,560
it and we can have it for free that's

1037
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,200
just amazing um

1038
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,880
oh and then there is sharing and i want

1039
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
to talk about sharing because sharing is

1040
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,880
not just like your little button right

1041
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,720
and the button matters like sending

1042
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,839
stuff to your friends that's really

1043
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,160
important um but there is something to

1044
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
be said about sharing in the economics

1045
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,400
of scale right one of the properties of

1046
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
digital artifacts is that they are very

1047
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,880
light like once you created it uh there

1048
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,960
is almost no cost in carrying it around

1049
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,760
and

1050
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
um

1051
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,839
under the right

1052
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,880
predications let's say um it is entirely

1053
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,000
conceivable that after the um the

1054
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,280
digital artifact has been created um it

1055
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,520
can facilitate things like interlibrary

1056
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
loans like you no longer have to send

1057
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,040
the actual book uh you can direct the

1058
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,880
service i don't recall the name but you

1059
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,800
can ask a library to send you like a

1060
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,640
chunk of a book

1061
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
that can also be sped up

1062
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,599
you can

1063
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,760
you can really supercharge the sharing

1064
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,400
infrastructure of libraries with uh by

1065
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
building a digital library

1066
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,920
um there's obviously multimedia um like

1067
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,839
embedding like the ability of really

1068
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,119
experiencing texts and uh and learning

1069
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,040
in a way that we haven't before i for

1070
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,280
instance for one i really struggle i

1071
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,480
really like maths but i'm not good at it

1072
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,839
and i really struggle learning it from

1073
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,839
books but if i can like see stuff that

1074
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,720
moves uh that really helps me so

1075
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,280
that's a classic example of that

1076
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
and then uh and then there's linking i

1077
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,280
think this is another like

1078
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,400
killer feature uh that that i think if

1079
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,920
you have spent any amount of time doing

1080
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,200
research on uh on wikipedia um this will

1081
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,720
speak to you so

1082
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,640
this page is for martin luther king and

1083
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,400
at the end

1084
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,359
down here you have a quotation for

1085
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,599
cutler s abuse of power well

1086
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,400
at the archive we went and fixed two

1087
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,560
million of these links and now they deep

1088
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
link right into the page where the

1089
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,119
citation is is for

1090
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,280
you can have access to all of this

1091
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,200
wealth of information at a click that's

1092
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,680
what a digital library can do that's why

1093
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,319
it matters because

1094
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,599
it really expands your your ability to

1095
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,000
um to be creative to

1096
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
and to do research and to learn um and

1097
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,359
then ultimately uh the reason why a

1098
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,160
digital library matters is that um in

1099
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,440
this world

1100
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,680
that we came to live in

1101
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,720
we are

1102
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,280
making very heavy use of digital assets

1103
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,480
but somehow we don't really have the

1104
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
infrastructure for it and so

1105
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,359
i don't know if you guys have heard

1106
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,960
about fake news but that seems to be a

1107
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
problem

1108
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,599
first source like original sources um

1109
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,480
that are trustworthy are hard to come by

1110
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,200
libraries are not just

1111
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
places libraries are organizations they

1112
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,119
are people and they are reservoirs of

1113
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,280
trust having a lender of last resort

1114
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,839
that you can trust that will have the

1115
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,720
right untampered original file may

1116
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
really matter

1117
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,119
and also you know

1118
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,440
lots of copies keep things safe but what

1119
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
happens if nobody has the copy we have

1120
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,240
to have a lender of last resort somebody

1121
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,960
who has the torrent file the file that

1122
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,040
all the torrents resolve to

1123
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,960
um

1124
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,280
anyway i want to just wrap this up um i

1125
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,880
hope i um

1126
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,040
i made a case for why building digital

1127
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,119
libraries matter but um i want to make

1128
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,599
it further in in the sense of like how

1129
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,359
how does this like affect your life

1130
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,839
right now well um

1131
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,480
here's a couple of ideas reading like

1132
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
knowing that this resource exists i'm

1133
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,599
not talking about the internet archive

1134
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,119
but there is tons of other digital

1135
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,560
libraries and i encourage you to

1136
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,880
discover them and even build them

1137
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,000
but

1138
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,920
if you don't take even an active role in

1139
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,359
in building one you can certainly be a

1140
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,640
patron and and consume it so uh

1141
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,520
be reminded and be uh

1142
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,599
uh aware of the fact that there is like

1143
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,520
this joyous resource that that you can

1144
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,319
use and you can just like um delve into

1145
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,160
um and you know at least on the archive

1146
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,520
you can upload your digital files but

1147
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,119
you're already doing that on your apple

1148
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,960
cloud or whatever just like be mindful

1149
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,359
that um what you really are doing is

1150
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,640
constructing a digital library um

1151
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,119
moving books into wikipedia

1152
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,200
uh very important uh

1153
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,240
if you find a broken link you can uh you

1154
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,400
can fix it yourself or tell us oh and

1155
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,319
you have books that you think should

1156
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,480
make it if you have a book that you have

1157
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,079
seen nowhere and you want it to be on

1158
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,880
the archive send it to us archive.org

1159
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,319
you will find the address on there we

1160
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,400
take physical donations send it to us

1161
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,319
you know

1162
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,880
after this experience of kovid

1163
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,560
we are all homeschoolers right we all

1164
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,160
had the experience of being like stuck

1165
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,680
at home and just have like no access to

1166
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,079
the outside world that's a reminder of

1167
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,160
like how this library may be useful to

1168
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,240
you all of the stuff at your fingertips

1169
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,160
it's not just a caprice it really

1170
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,240
matters things think of students who

1171
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,960
couldn't complete their classes

1172
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,880
and you know you could travel the world

1173
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,640
access all of these libraries around the

1174
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,560
world there is libraries everywhere and

1175
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,240
everybody is building digital libraries

1176
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,599
it's not i'm not just like this is not a

1177
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,480
spot for the archive this is really um

1178
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,000
a love letter to digital libraries um

1179
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,160
and

1180
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,240
i i think i just want to conclude by

1181
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,319
saying this i think

1182
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,280
um

1183
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,359
from the dawn of time you know people

1184
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,440
have built libraries like they are

1185
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
fundamental part of uh

1186
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,400
sorry knowledge accumulation is a

1187
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,960
fundamental part of like how a society

1188
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,119
functions and if we are to have a

1189
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,520
functional society we have to have

1190
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,839
functional libraries and if we have if

1191
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,560
we want to have a functional internet we

1192
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,839
have to have functional digital

1193
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,119
libraries the dream of the internet was

1194
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,119
to have like this open

1195
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,599
library this open conversation

1196
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,240
and this free exchange of knowledge

1197
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,000
boy as it turned out to be harder than

1198
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,400
we thought but it was the right idea and

1199
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,599
it still is

1200
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,839
thank you

1201
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,250
[Applause]

1202
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,440
i think we've got a couple of minutes um

1203
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,720
so we have questions if you have

1204
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,640
questions there's a microphone here i

1205
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,720
swear to god if you ask me about ocr

1206
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,960
no no um what was your biggest

1207
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,960
achievement and toughest challenge in

1208
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,520
your journey

1209
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,599
well that's a good one that's like an

1210
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,119
interview question

1211
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,480
in five years where will you see

1212
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,960
yourself now

1213
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,599
okay the not to pat myself on the back

1214
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,520
but i think my biggest achievement

1215
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,000
nobody cares about this thankfully uh

1216
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,319
but i rewrote that the whole app that

1217
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,680
you saw

1218
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,520
uh when i picked it up it was kind of a

1219
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,240
mess uh and then you know i made it an

1220
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
even bigger mess uh and then it went

1221
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,800
into production and so i had to refactor

1222
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,160
the whole thing

1223
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,319
and i managed to do it i i could talk

1224
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,000
about for hours about like what that

1225
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,319
entailed but uh it was like there is

1226
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,920
this famous metaphor of changing the

1227
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,359
wheels where you're going 100 miles an

1228
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,200
hour down the highway it was exactly

1229
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,040
that except the car was on fire

1230
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,720
um

1231
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,400
uh

1232
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,000
that was my biggest what was the hardest

1233
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,440
thing oh definitely the corrections

1234
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,119
definitely like that that rigmarole of

1235
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,359
sending back stuff to the original

1236
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,960
station and like track where the book is

1237
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,720
that was a nightmare that was a

1238
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,560
nightmare uh the other online question

1239
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,000
we have is um

1240
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,839
and this kind of goes to like libraries

1241
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,760
can have books that are still in print

1242
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,839
are still being published sure but how

1243
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,760
does uh this uh

1244
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,599
digitalization affect copyrights for

1245
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,319
books still being published

1246
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,079
how does it affect copyright copyright

1247
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,319
so that way oh that is a much that's a

1248
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,839
much bigger conversation i'm really not

1249
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,560
qualified to talk about

1250
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,680
uh thank you thank you very much very

1251
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,079
interesting i have a question for well i

1252
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,319
have a question rather um if hypo

1253
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,640
hypothetically i have a partner who

1254
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,240
looks at me wrong whenever i bring a new

1255
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,079
book in the house

1256
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,160
how can i do this at home so i can keep

1257
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,800
all my books

1258
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,200
how you can digitize stuff at home yes

1259
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,920
oh that's that's really tough one

1260
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,599
i guess it's a function of how much time

1261
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,560
you have

1262
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,319
and how much effort you want to put into

1263
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,960
it um

1264
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,240
there is a great little project it's

1265
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,599
called the diy book scanner um it's

1266
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,079
something that we actually drew from in

1267
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,599
designing our own

1268
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,200
our own scanner

1269
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,640
it's it's an open source hardware

1270
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,279
project that

1271
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,680
will help you build a little rig it's

1272
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,440
made of like wood it's very simple to

1273
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,559
build um it's like it creates a

1274
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,960
cradle uh with plexiglass and there's

1275
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,880
some wood and you can like uh with two

1276
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,280
cameras like very cheap cameras you can

1277
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,200
actually build a pretty functional box

1278
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,520
digitization uh system as far as

1279
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,319
software is concerned um there is a ton

1280
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,720
of open source software to do

1281
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,319
to do book scanning

1282
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,520
but if you want to know more about that

1283
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520
i can talk to you at length about

1284
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,480
about software for sure

1285
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,079
davide i think people here might be

1286
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,240
interested in the lawsuit

1287
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,640
are you going to mention that

1288
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,160
i don't know what you're talking about

1289
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,760
i know aha

1290
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,680
i know i know what to say i've watched

1291
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,599
so many movies oh my god my entire life

1292
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,280
led up to this under the provisions

1293
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,119
afforded to me under the fifth amendment

1294
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,359
of this constitution i respectfully

1295
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,720
declined to answer the question

1296
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,520
do you mind finally all of the time

1297
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,079
watching the enron trial is paying back

1298
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,400
do you mind if i mention it

1299
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,520
kind of okay

1300
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,119
well let me just say

1301
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,960
four publishers have sued the internet

1302
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,079
archive

1303
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,920
for copyright infringement for lending

1304
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,839
out too many books when all the physical

1305
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,800
libraries in the world were closed and

1306
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,880
setting up the emergency lending library

1307
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,040
before that we would lend as many books

1308
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,240
as we had

1309
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,640
out at a time as we had physical copies

1310
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,119
of and we exceeded those limits when all

1311
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,200
the libraries were closed so you might

1312
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,960
look at archive.org

1313
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,960
in the blog section

1314
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,800
to see the details about that

1315
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,480
[Applause]

1316
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,000
i think my question may have almost just

1317
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,240
been answered but i wanted to expand on

1318
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,400
the previous copyright question

1319
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,040
by narrowing it to i did notice the

1320
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,720
feature on the screen about like

1321
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,880
borrowing the book and i haven't i

1322
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,079
probably should have haven't taken

1323
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,599
advantage of that can you tell me more

1324
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,119
about how that works and does that only

1325
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,720
apply to copyrighted work so the rest

1326
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,400
you can just see it without borrowing it

1327
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,559
oh sure the way that works is uh that

1328
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,960
you can um like only one person a design

1329
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,079
can can

1330
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,760
access the book and uh you make an

1331
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,000
account on archive.org and um you

1332
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,440
request access to the book much much

1333
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,880
like you would do in a normal library

1334
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,319
you have it for an amount of time and

1335
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,839
then you return it and the next person

1336
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,200
online gets it

1337
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,680
it's free

1338
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
is there anything that you guys like

1339
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,680
either refuse to publish or refuse to

1340
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
archive that you were given or submitted

1341
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,280
or

1342
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,520
uh

1343
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,079
you mean

1344
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,680
like we looked at it we're like ah not

1345
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,240
this yeah like it was a super obscene uh

1346
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,200
oh yeah not right no i think

1347
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,359
no not really i mean there is like i

1348
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,520
mean isis at some point was like really

1349
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,280
big on uploading videos on the archive

1350
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,960
and so we tried to like put a lid on

1351
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,720
that but we didn't delete it we just

1352
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,440
like

1353
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,720
you know like try to

1354
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,559
dampen the amount of propaganda that

1355
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,640
would go through our channels trying not

1356
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,680
to serve them that way

1357
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,079
this actually this is actually a related

1358
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,520
question

1359
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,160
do uh to what extent do digital

1360
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,640
libraries see it as their responsibility

1361
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,160
or to what the extent do you think it's

1362
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,480
their responsibility to contextualize

1363
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,359
this sort of uh information like take

1364
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,200
for exam example

1365
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,319
phrenology from your presentation

1366
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,079
that's a really profound question

1367
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,319
because

1368
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,119
libraries are typically not just a place

1369
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,960
they are you know organizations they're

1370
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
made of people and the figure of a

1371
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,559
librarian um

1372
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,640
is is really key part of that i don't i

1373
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,480
don't have an answer to that yet i i

1374
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,319
think there's like the answer probably

1375
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,160
should be some responsibility um i i

1376
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,559
how you do that at scale kind of kind of

1377
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,640
hard to to answer i know that for

1378
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,960
smaller uh more scoped libraries there

1379
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,920
is like

1380
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,319
a lot of curation that goes on into um

1381
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,480
you know contextualizing artifacts with

1382
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,640
metadata and such uh it definitely can

1383
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,079
be done in in that way at scale

1384
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,079
an open problem i guess but a very

1385
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,079
important one very important one

1386
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,000
great talk thank you very much thank you

1387
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,040
um i saw you're a fan of borges uh in

1388
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,839
the in your biography um i was wondering

1389
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,839
how uh if you talk about

1390
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,480
what in his work inspired you to do this

1391
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,839
and how do you think porquez would have

1392
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:36,800
viewed

1393
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,880
the internet archive you said vargas

1394
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,680
yeah

1395
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,200
um i actually

1396
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,559
forgot i forgot to mention thank you

1397
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,079
thank you very much for that uh so

1398
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,280
burger is my favorite writer uh and he

1399
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,440
famously um

1400
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,559
called the universe a library um i think

1401
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,240
that may be a little ambitious but

1402
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,720
certainly society uh depends on

1403
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,640
libraries um there's

1404
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,480
uh don't get me started on vargas man

1405
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,760
like we're gonna be here all night i

1406
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,280
only have i think one minute not even

1407
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,640
that i think we're done we're done

1408
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,839
we did it

1409
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:08,640
thank you

1410
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:16,509

you have any questions for diabetes

1413
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,160
he'll be right outside the hall signing

1414
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,760
autographs

1415
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,160
digital autographs

1416
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,129
[Music]

1417
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,040
