1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,920
so

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,760
so

3
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
mic check one

4
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
goodness okay

5
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
how's this everybody

6
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
excellent thanks thank you

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
there's some dry announcements

8
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,679
okay sounds good

9
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
i might start with announcements

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
you know what i will do my announcements

11
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
now because you're eager to go and my

12
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,640
announcements are literally i hope

13
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,040
everybody's having a good time so far

14
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,400
yes nice wonderful good good good

15
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
um a few couple of things you know keep

16
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,080
your masks on unless you're eating and

17
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,159
drinking please hydrate yourself we want

18
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,840
to make sure everybody's

19
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
good this weekend you know if you need a

20
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,720
masquerade go outside take a break we

21
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,239
encourage that we still have um a fourth

22
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
we have a fourth track for like talks

23
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920
that some of you are probably

24
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
facilitating just on the go you could go

25
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,480
to the coffee shop to look those up or

26
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,519
go on our wiki page and check those out

27
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,840
um we still have is it hackers got

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,799
talent tonight i think so if you want to

29
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,760
karaoke one of those sign up

30
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
karaoke also we i think you guys are

31
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,159
singing huh okay so we'll see you there

32
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
um please sign up for those and have a

33
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,120
good time um and then we have a matrix

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
chat and some questions are coming in

35
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
from there people are really engaging in

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,799
the online versions the cool thing about

37
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,640
that is that's going to be ongoing and

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
so we might even post this talk there so

39
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,799
if you want to continue the conversation

40
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,319
please go there and that's going to be

41
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
ongoing so without further ado this is

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
let's talk about by printing with xavier

43
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,840
lewis palmer give him a round of

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
applause and let's get started

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,360
hello everybody

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
all right

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,799
my name is oh yeah oh sorry

48
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,279
yeah uh so um

49
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,519
for an introduction

50
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,040
oh

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
here we go all right so for an

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
introduction i've lived most of my life

53
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
thus far on the east coast i'm a student

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
tech enthusiast stan enjoy collaborating

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
on cool biomedical projects i did

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
reading taking part tech my first was

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
nes

58
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
and uh yeah uh i love art

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
uh to the right you'll see images of me

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,919
working on my labs bioprinter in 2018.

61
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,680
uh curtis and this image is courtesy of

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
the daily press and virginia pilot um

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,759
uh next is a snapshot of one of our

64
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,560
papers followed by figures of a chimeric

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
memory organoid developed with the use

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,120
of our 3d bio printer my gestational

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
work was in part built around these

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
things i was introduced to hope in 2016

69
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
as a participant it was taken aback at

70
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,720
the warmth of the community

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
activities prepared frankness of

72
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
conversation freedom of exploration and

73
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
more to be here as a speaker surreal and

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
an absolute pleasure

75
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
general spent a lot of time in school

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,120
prior to my doctorate work had obtained

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,039
two bachelor's degrees from odu

78
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,720
one philosophy

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,639
one in biological sciences from east

80
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,320
virginia medical school same city

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,080
acquired a masters in biotechnology and

82
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,479
then tackled the other masters in cyber

83
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,639
and middle of my entering phd while my

84
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
lab temporarily closed uh during the

85
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
pandemic previous research experience

86
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,160
before grad school brought me to the

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,039
national institutes of standard

88
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
technology and the american dental

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,880
association foundation and several

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,719
university labs let's continue

91
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
all right so this talk will be mostly

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,080
introductory and casual i decided to cut

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
out a lot of material and jargon as well

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,600
as some fight quite a bit for time and

95
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,919
focus this will also be fast to make the

96
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,639
fit

97
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,000
we'll discuss vibrating and operating

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
culture along with some resource and

99
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
place to look expect some overly but

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
genuinely sentimental

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,199
shout outs after further i am excluding

102
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,120
crucial commentary my gestation work and

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
out of respect in my lab

104
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
additional time will be given as a

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
for a bonus uh feature and

106
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,639
to also feel questions as i want to be

107
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,919
more interactive versus just me

108
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
lecturing but i'll be again towards the

109
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,560
end let's proceed

110
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
so what is bioprinting essentially a

111
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,039
transport of biological materials onto a

112
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
surface or into an object with the goal

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,000
of building

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
the media that is the material in which

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,919
biological material is suspended plus

116
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,680
biological materials of interest are

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
together referred to as the bioink of

118
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
which there are many types barbarians

119
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
can be 2d that is they can print on many

120
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
surfaces or 3d that they can print along

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
a third axis the most functional will be

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
of the latter

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
commonly you'll find that many uh

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,440
printers use syringes to deposit

125
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,039
biological material that's not the only

126
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,680
means the bio ink is often comprised of

127
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
media made from the

128
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
from other living cells that a system

129
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,000
with a process of adhesion proliferation

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
and differentiation during and after the

131
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
printing well or after the printing for

132
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,919
those not developing tissue systems the

133
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,800
bio ink may simply be composed of what

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
preserves the biological materials or

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,400
facilitates their transport through

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
whatever

137
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
whatever containers uh that they pass

138
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,039
through

139
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,240
for example if you're printing something

140
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
that clogs needles uh

141
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,400
or activates uh

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
like or activates prematurely your ink

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
might have compounds that resist that on

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,639
the bioactive side your bio ink might be

145
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,080
configured to maintain conditions that

146
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
will prevent the degradation of proteins

147
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
or other bioactive molecules or even add

148
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,440
structure to your contract later on

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
common eye pile inks are adapted from

150
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
natural polymers and biomaterials found

151
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
in excellent matrices such as gelatin

152
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
cytosine various types of alginates

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
collagen and more some are synthetic

154
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
further the format of bio

155
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
3d bar

156
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
the format of 3d bio printer prints is a

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
variable some 3d bio printers work with

158
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,759
large cells or large aggregate cells or

159
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,319
otherwise large aggregate vomit uh

160
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
materials while some aim for smaller

161
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
aggregates or even on the single cell

162
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
basis

163
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
printing in large cell aggregates or

164
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,039
biomaterial aggregates allows for the

165
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,479
ease of printing and large scale

166
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
construct development but cell count

167
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
precision and microstructure desired may

168
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
be sacrificing the process

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
a lot of prints are just blobs sometimes

170
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,800
but hey it can be useful

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
but to the right you'll see uh strata

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,599
you'll see strategies for bio printing

173
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,240
as shown in hierarchical's 2019 paper 3d

174
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,360
bio

175
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
uh from benches to traditional uh tren

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
to translational applications these are

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
but some of many types of

178
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,399
strategies that exist you have sterile

179
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,399
stereo lithography ink the jet printing

180
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
laser assisted by printing extrusion bar

181
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
printing and spinning uh based biopretty

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
but again these are just some

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,200
we can usually take an entire day

184
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
running through how all of these work

185
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
specifically but we don't we won't use

186
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
them for the uh so we won't mention

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,399
these for the uh for the for the purpose

188
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,760
of time we won't go into detail for the

189
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,120
purpose of time

190
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
later i will go into uh into depth uh

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
for one of these which is extrusion but

192
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,560
that'll be later

193
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
the workflow of bioprinting is fairly

194
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
simple once your project is planned out

195
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
uh from there one creates a design they

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
want selects the bio inks and

197
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
apparatuses to use they print the

198
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
contract and process the printed

199
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
construct after a figure from the paper

200
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
by printing for the biologists by delhi

201
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
at al in 2021 is shown on the upper left

202
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,360
the overall paper is good and accessible

203
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,640
to read i recommend reading through it

204
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
there and they detail the process well

205
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
from a biologist from biologist's

206
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,160
perspective an engineer or artist may

207
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
provide tweaks but is

208
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,519
a solid workflow overall 3d scanning can

209
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
play a role in the crafting of

210
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,760
more true-to-form body features as

211
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
mentioned in the work of sail at al 2014

212
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
paper which is operating technologies

213
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
applications and one section they

214
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,080
describe medical imaging used towards

215
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
crafting a more biomedic structure

216
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
modeled after a body part a workflow

217
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,080
figure take it from the from the paper

218
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,720
is shown in the lower left

219
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,040
oop

220
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,240
here we go

221
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
oh something's missing

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,640
okay yeah so bob printers are used in a

223
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,079
variety of ways by many labs be they

224
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
industrial academic government labs

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
community biospaces or the home lab of

226
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
tinkerer for example on the industrial

227
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
side company companies like organova

228
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
rokit have printers in which uh they you

229
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
know they uh they have printers which

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,320
they print cells or scaffolding

231
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
materials together on a macro scale in

232
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,519
large uh reliable shapes on the high end

233
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,800
printers like these can cost from the

234
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars

235
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,000
but our thoughts out the rate and thus

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
out the range of many uh

237
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
many uh

238
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
many diy enthusiasts

239
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
in response many uh teams have uh

240
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,279
fashion reliable buyer printers uh

241
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
that are that are quite affordable some

242
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
as low as 250 euros

243
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,079
but it doesn't mean that the quality is

244
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,600
nicely up to par but they do allow for

245
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
some reasonable insights while the

246
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,640
making use of bioprinters are important

247
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
the benefits of the use are also worth

248
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
discussing operating allows for a wide

249
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
range of novel basic science experiments

250
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
the processes bring closer the

251
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
possibility of organ tissue replacements

252
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,480
in the not so far future this is

253
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,839
increasingly important as citizens all

254
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
over the world continue to face organ uh

255
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,120
donor uh shortages and many

256
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
uh donated organs remain compatible with

257
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,360
potential uh uh recipients poppies are

258
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,040
the possibilities are many if not

259
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
endless but much work is required to

260
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
unlock the potential the top image shows

261
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,800
the picture of a 3d bar printer produced

262
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
using a reprop 3d printer which can be

263
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
affordably acquired the lower left and

264
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
right image shows off the commercial

265
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,000
rokit doctrine vivo 46 and the organovo

266
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,320
novogen nmx printers which can print

267
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
high quality

268
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,920
each of these diy and commercial each

269
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
have value in the same world despite

270
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,320
their differences

271
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
so for the enthusiast

272
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,279
bioprinting allows for multiple

273
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,880
prompting avenues some of these options

274
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
exist

275
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,480
in but are not exclusive to the avenues

276
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
of prototyping platforms structurally or

277
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,399
behaviorally

278
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
these also include art basic science

279
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,360
engineering

280
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,279
basic science engineering research and

281
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,519
wearable and implant testing

282
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,279
basic science and engineering come easy

283
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
to mind particularly the focus of the

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,200
benefits in superior 3d culture and 3d

285
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
cultural produce 3d bioprinting

286
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,480
of course through versus traditional 2d

287
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
and 3d culture you get increased

288
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
organization of biomaterials and cells

289
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,680
for some work this can mean more subtle

290
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,519
cell interactions this can mean

291
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
improved culture culture integrity

292
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,959
through more pronounced ecm deployment

293
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
and by ecm deployment i mean as the xlr

294
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
matrix which are these network proteins

295
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
that cells extrude

296
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
this this can also mean stronger

297
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
in vitro micro micro

298
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,079
environmental

299
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,440
modeling

300
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240
thanks stars guys

301
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
greater tissue complexity above all more

302
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
automatable and repeatable interactions

303
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,440
through the process uh you can design

304
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,800
helpful experiments that allow people

305
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
deeper insight into how cells interact

306
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
how biological or biologically based

307
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,720
structures will behave under numerous

308
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
internal or external stressors and more

309
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
basic answers to basic questions form

310
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
the foundation for more complex work and

311
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,399
are not to be underestimated or looked

312
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,000
down upon

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
these are easily in a range of amateur

314
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
and otherwise early scientists these

315
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
scientists with basic but sufficiently

316
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
calibrated tools and well rained in

317
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
hypotheses can do a lot to advance

318
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
modern science through

319
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,800
experiments that amplify precision in

320
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,639
examining key molecular signals that

321
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
take place between cells

322
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,079
their environment and or examine the

323
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,079
structural and chemical components of

324
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,240
various microenvironments generated

325
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
and just for and for review like

326
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,279
microenvironments is the environment

327
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,720
like that or immediately that's

328
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,839
immediately around the

329
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,279
cells an engineer can add value in

330
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,199
research for example by uh finding more

331
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,480
efficient ways to precisely place

332
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
materials within 3d culturing systems

333
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
uh or make 3d printers more

334
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
cost-effective

335
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,880
as a protein as a prototyping platform

336
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
gleaned from set was said above improved

337
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,040
biotextiles or similar products can be

338
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
better made and trial an easy example of

339
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,399
this thing comes the form of food or

340
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,760
clothing or clothing material with the

341
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
right bioprint design you can create and

342
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
test rapidly

343
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
art

344
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
specifically about art is exciting uh

345
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,600
venue as well bio inks again the

346
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
material used to print allow artists

347
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
additional means to explore visual

348
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,360
and or uh

349
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
tactile concepts uh in that that are

350
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
quite dynamic

351
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
um for example

352
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,160
um those working with molds bacteria and

353
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,920
these can have them plotted through

354
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
agarose or similar jell-o-like material

355
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,440
for a 4d work of art

356
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
additives to your jedi can enhance your

357
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
display through time time delay color

358
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
changes opacity changes texture changes

359
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
otherwise

360
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,680
you do not have to you do not only have

361
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
to print gels you can print on papers

362
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,720
films and other types of services that

363
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,639
suit your fancy bioprinting can be a

364
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,560
fine way to make your art precisely come

365
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,079
alive

366
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,440
finally for those testing wearables

367
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,880
implants and various other active

368
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,639
compound compounds that interact with

369
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,320
the body bioprinting gives an avenue by

370
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,519
which one can test our effects on

371
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,839
specific animal tissues without harming

372
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,920
a whole complex organism of course there

373
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
are caveats these are done with various

374
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,920
drugs cosmetics no matter who you may be

375
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,519
bioprinting has appeal for everyone

376
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,480
all right so from my use uh largely via

377
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
my destination base worked i went with

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
the extrusion uh variety specifically

379
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
mechanical

380
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,040
this figure on the this figure on the uh

381
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
uh on the right shows uh two and i used

382
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
the one the left which was the which is

383
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
a schematic for the uh

384
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,040
mechanical micro extrusion talk it out

385
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
2021 gives a nice breakdown on the

386
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,560
generalities of mechanical extrusion as

387
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,480
shown on the left from the figure above

388
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
to quote the plunger then generates a

389
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
compression force on the piston of a

390
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,759
syringe which contains about ink the

391
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,519
rotation of the stepper motor defines

392
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,519
the speed and quantity of the extrusion

393
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,279
thereby allowing the printing process to

394
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,880
be controlled by a computer program

395
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
meanwhile the gauge

396
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,880
of the syringes needle acts as a nozzle

397
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,720
and defines the diameter of the extruded

398
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
filament and it is also not worthy to

399
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,759
mention that there is a variant of

400
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
mechanical extrusion that uses a turning

401
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,120
screw which is not shown in this example

402
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,399
like what is used in industrial

403
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,920
screw-driven polymer extruders to push

404
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,759
the bot ink out of the nozzle however

405
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
this method is less popular because it

406
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,440
can introduce unjustified damage to the

407
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
cells inside of bioink and quote however

408
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
i could say that the last part can and

409
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
was engineered around

410
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,360
so our lab pioneered a low-cost

411
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,720
extrusion-based 3d bioprinter that

412
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
allows us to deposit cells directly into

413
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,079
a pre-prepared acceler matrix rather

414
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,880
than print cells with ecm you can

415
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,920
move differently other than uh then how

416
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,079
else is in research with enough uh with

417
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,920
enough with enough with enough research

418
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,199
inside and effort

419
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,000
our 3d bioprint has a is a felix 3.0

420
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,480
bioprinter that uh this is a few it's a

421
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
felix 3.0 3d printer that's been

422
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
modified through the addition of

423
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,639
components and other accessories listed

424
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,320
at odustemcell.org

425
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
that is you can download our plans and

426
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,199
apply it to your own printer this

427
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
bioprinter prints a bio inc composed of

428
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,600
cells and based media

429
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,959
these are pushed through a specially

430
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,400
fashioned micropipette through a

431
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
pre-prepared accelera matrix in the form

432
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
of a hydrogel within the wells of a cell

433

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
script and fed to a printer controller

440
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,839
successful 3d prints are placed to

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,160
incubate at 37 degrees celsius

442
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,599
and coach over one to two week periods

virginia pilot and daily press who came

455
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,400
through to learn more about our lab's

456
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,600
work

457
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,760
the lower right is a chimeric organoid

458
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
that's developing from one of our prior

459
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
papers at different time points

460
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,480
as you can see the living components

461
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
as you can see the limit components make

462
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
3d prints rather dynamic one of the main

463
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,919
motivations design route is that it's

464
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,919
highly accessible allowing for highly

465
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,440
repeatable results all these aspects

466
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
needed in biomedical science with such a

467
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,640
platform you can create your code print

468
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
your cells develop your organoids and

469
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,080
tissue structures and then share your

470
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
code and results with interested

471
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
sciences this can be made for less than

472
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
fifteen hundred dollars of course we're

473
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
not the only lab with you know with uh

474
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,440
with affordability in mind let's need to

475
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
share

476
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,679
some laps they've used even cheaper 3d

477
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,360
printers to to make buyer printing more

478
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,879
accessible in different capacities

479
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,640
so uh projects as you'll find are not

480
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
always straightforward when buyer

481
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
printing you have a lot to consider it

482
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,799
is helpful to ask yourself which one to

483
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
design when and how you process it and

484
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
the parameters required for your

485
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,160
incubating system to keep each component

486
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
functional helps have a reference for

487
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,520
all of these especially the latter i

488
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
recommend looking up recent research on

489
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,120
what other groups are doing along with

490
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,640
finding the rationale you'll find a

491
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
variety information with varying

492
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
efficacy but is all useful if you know

493
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
how to analyze it all learning from the

494
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
successes of teams and their missteps is

495
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
exceedingly viable

496
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,360
significance into understanding prior

497
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,120
research into environmental components

498
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,039
of design i'll take a page from

499
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,720
developmental biology as applied to

500
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
tissue engineering for those

501
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,480
new to development mental biology

502
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,559
sulfate determination refers to how a

503
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
cell develops into a particular cell

504
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,200
type

505
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,559
various aspects of sulfate can be

506
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,320
determined not just by cell genomics but

507
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
also by their microenvironment the

508
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,679
cellular microenvironment comprises

509
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,880
everything that surrounds cells from

510
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
their axillary fluid their secreted

511
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,039
proteins nucleic acid their neighbors

512
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,559
singly molecules present in environment

513
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,760
and structures that they are attached to

514
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
otherwise interact with it's not that's

515
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,559
not exclusive the uh

516
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,640
the figure to the right from huayngadow

517
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
2017 shows some shows the various

518
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
components within 3d culture that

519
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
researchers are mindful of if your

520
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,679
project concerns teach engineering for

521
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,039
example you find that your research will

522
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
require moderation to avoid going over a

523
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,799
budget

524
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,000
many of you are trying to grow a new

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,520
appendage you might have to wait some

526
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,720
good time tissue engineering holds

527
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,159
promise not just for

528
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,600
regenerative technologies but also for

529
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,120
basic and translational science

530
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
scientific study of stem cell and cancer

531
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,559
biology however many essential

532
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,400
developmental techniques that would

533
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
lead successfully to advances require

534
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,159
much validation to close this gap

535
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,840
numerous incremental steps are needed

536
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,720
these require an integrated

537
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
understanding of genomic cell behavior

538
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,520
physical signals in the immediate

539
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
environment and improve framework for

540
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,720
understanding how these altogether

541
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,080
impact cell fade

542
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,600
additionally better tools to reconstruct

543
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,360
these environments to validate

544
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
to validate the

545
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,000
improved self uh frameworks are also

546
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,440
needed now it's not to say that you

547
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
can't create cool stuff

548
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
i trust that many of you

549
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,039
will be a part of why and when we can

550
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
create even cooler stuff just requires

551
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
extra nuance

552
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,159
so

553
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,760
stuff that uh the part that many of you

554
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,000
been waiting for some diys uh resources

555
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,360
most typo oh let's see uh yes so

556
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
that said uh 3d bioprinting is highly

557
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,120
accessible you can start by choosing a

558
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,799
3d bio printing kit and modify it to

559
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,799
your specifications to print as per your

560
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,400
strategy you may find that electro

561
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
spinning may suit you better than stereo

562
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,919
lithography i recommend kits as they

563
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
simplify the building in printer

564
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
prototyping process you may find that

565
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,039
electrospinning may suit you better than

566
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,000
stereo lithography or some other process

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,679
i recommend like

568
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,120
sorry

569
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
further um

570
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
several kits are open source allowing

571
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,159
you greater flexibility and design open

572
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
source has that benefit and you can

573
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,640
modify a you can choose the option of

574
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
modifying a pre-prepared printer but you

575
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,760
stand to face more challenges in

576
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
deconstructing uh

577
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
proprietary hardware and software if it

578
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
is not open source the worth of either

579
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,919
path is up to you and your project

580
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,280
a team

581
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,799
at frederick alexander university

582
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
erlingan nurenberg if i'm pronouncing

583
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
correctly they modified an anet a8 for

584
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,320
example and document their success in

585
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,080
their journal article producing some

586
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
some alpha work their printer costs a

587
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,760
mere 150 euros an anet a8 was also used

588
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,080
by a team from the university of patras

589
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
in greece

590
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,039
for those that are

591
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,000
not ambitious and not as ambitious but

592
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,159
but and would like some assistance some

593
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,600
groups have created their own that you

594
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,240
can use for inspiration and they

595
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,520
and they even they place those

596
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
instructions on instructables uh for

597
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,360
example team at uc davis modified a

598
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
monoprice uh printer and proceeded their

599
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
designs for the instructables to create

600
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
a bio printer their printer can be

601
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
designed for less than 400

602
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,520
um

603
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,840
biocars bio communities a community

604
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,600
biospace in california produced a guide

605
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
for an even cheaper printer for 150

606
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,960
their instructions are very accessible

607
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,880
as well uh the question that remains is

608
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,400
of how much effort you wish to apply as

609
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
far as uh building or where you want to

610
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
go with your it depends on where you

611
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,360
want to go into your printer and how

612
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,720
much effort you want to supply towards

613
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,600
it

614
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,159
but nonetheless with bio the fun is more

615
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,600
inclined towards the biological aspects

616
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,960
of your project if you have the done

617
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
capacity it's fine to defer the

618
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
engineering of the hardware involved to

619
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,559
teams who sunk a lot into r d already

620
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,640
thus a commercial route can suit you all

621
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,679
3dp

622
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,039
lists several commercial buyer printers

623
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
out there for those with a dough but not

624
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
too much the previous mentioned paper by

625
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,039
tom get out in 2021 gives a review of

626
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,480
low-cost 3d buyer printers out there

627
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,640
so as you work your way into bioprotein

628
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
it's tempting to build and just do stuff

629
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,919
without much groundwork it's totally

630
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,880
understandable but if you want to take

631
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,799
your projects further you'll eventually

632
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,000
want to read the works of people who

633
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,440
have worked in your era before and have

634
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,799
documented it

635
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,320
to paraphrase a mentor of mine an hour

636
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,039
in the library can be a day in the lab

637
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,480
that's not to say that you should take

638
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,600
literature at face value or that you

639
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
shouldn't spend resources replicating

640
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
you're encouraged to be skeptical

641
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
however you will find that you'll find

642
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,760
several insights that

643
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,360
that you'll find several insights that

644
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,640
may have been repeated enough that you

645
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,720
can temporarily skip some steps in the

646
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,080
piloting of your process you're

647
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
encouraged to hop on google scholar or

648
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
whichever research based search engine

649
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,679
you prefer and see where your subfield

650
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,640
is

651
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,760
take a step further you're encouraged to

652
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,200
reach out and collaborate others

653
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
speaking with experience many

654
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,640
researchers are happy to share insights

655
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
and resources including their papers and

656
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
the off chance your interlibrary loan or

657
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,799
hub does not have that paper citations

658
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,640
and other mentions get interesting work

659
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
can be like crack to researchers

660
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,640
no matter how much no matter how you get

661
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,600
into it

662
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,679
if you are interested get in the game

663
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
show what you're made of and what you've

664
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,840
made

665
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,520
so i have a lot of people to shout out

666
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,720
but i want to live in here for several

667
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,480
reasons uh the first shout out goes to

668
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
rhett sanders may he rest in peace he's

669
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760
a scientist with a kind soul who true to

670
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,880
me and chem

671
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,960
the alternative bio scene in norfolk

672
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,679
virginia and introduce me to my friend

673
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,400
jameson duncan the norfolk arts and bio

674
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
scene is about his

675
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,360
place because of his presence brian

676
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,799
james and duncan many of you have been

677
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,360
here since 2016. uh no jameson for his

678
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
talk

679
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
at the 11th hope in 2016 titled biology

680
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
for hackers and hackers for biology

681
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
many of you have all seen this talk at

682
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,279
hope creating a general purpose network

683
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,679
through wireless mesh great talks

684
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,679
jameson introduced me to hope at a time

685
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,760
that i was lacking in a lot and it's

686
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,679
cool to a company once once again among

687
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,799
many things he has my thanks for good

688
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,080
times introduce me to this incredible

689
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,200
community

690
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880
and talk with them you'll quickly you'll

691
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,240
quickly get that he wants a better world

692
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
for us all that's dope

693
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,360
and uh together jameson and rhett formed

694
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,039
a community biospace called biologic in

695
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,200
which gave folks an alternative space to

696
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
learn uh intro bio concepts we would

697
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,120
teach groups of all ages cool bio

698
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
concepts and we under monitor the crazy

699
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
hair crew teaching beside him and

700
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
and rhett has been a joy

701
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,600
another person i want to shout out is uh

702
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,279
sebastian koshoba of new york botanics

703
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,240
and by namco labs he's learned an

704
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
intense number of techniques and

705
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
information surrounding plant genetics

706
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,880
programming hardware design and teaches

707
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,559
it to good souls you've likely read

708
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,240
about the atlantic wall street journal

709
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
genetic literacy project

710
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,679
uh and more and i can tell you he's even

711
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,440
more amazing than his article show he's

712
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,279
one of many who have met

713
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,120
and have been inspired by it i hope back

714
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,400
in 2016.

715
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
in contributes to a lot of scientific

716
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,200
causes that promote literacy and

717
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,120
reasonable access i ask that you donate

718
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,559
to his causes so he can help his work

719
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,960
and those trusted to boost

720
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,760
educational efforts and initiatives

721
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,919
next globe community bio summit

722
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,279
gets in the shadows as well is a

723
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,720
wonderful community composed of

724
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,919
individuals across the globe who are

725
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,919
interested in bioart biodesign science

726
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,200
communication

727
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
biosecurity food and more there are a

728
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,000
ton of people within i would like to

729

thank but that's

730
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
that's that's a lot so i'll leave it as

731
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,600
a group

732
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
mention they're having a hybrid uh

733
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
conference this november from the 18th

734
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
to the 20th if you're interested in

735
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,600
community bio and want to learn more

736
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,440
about the various projects that

737
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
individuals from around the world bring

738
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
to the table for that uh visit

739
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,039
biosummit.org

740
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,559
next i want to thank everyone whose

741
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,240
research sports helped me along in my

742
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
grad school career general research and

743
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,840
this talk we stand on the shows of

744
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,000
giants and i will welcome you all in

745
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
research and and just general diy hobby

746
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,559
to stand on mine

747
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,080
next to last i want to thank everyone

748
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,360
hope community it's been enjoyed to be

749

patience throughout this

753
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,159
last i want to thank the tinkerer who is

754
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,400
not sure if he belongs is very awkward

755
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,760
and has to be watched this enlisted his

756
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
talk i want to tell you that you mostly

757
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,440
cert you most certainly do matter and i

758
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,640
and so many others are glad that you're

759
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,919
here furthermore we're waiting for your

760
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,320
next talk

761
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,400
so

762
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,919
for references i listed uh several uh

763
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,760
review papers which upgrade in the field

764
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,919
review paper is an excellent way to

765
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,880
um

766
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,320
to understand the field very quickly as

767
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,600
we'll give you a wide view of the field

768
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
and can quickly bring you up to speed

769
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,520
for anyone wanting to dip to dip it to

770
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,200
gaps left open from this talk i

771
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,880
encourage jumping into the

772
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
interviews and reading to your heart's

773
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,919
content i occasionally get asked where

774
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,679
to start in bioprinting but frankly it's

775
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,200
best to get in where you can and learn

776
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,559
just like any other you're interested in

777
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,000
there's no correct entry point just

778
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
easier ones however you won't get

779
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
anywhere if you don't start at all you

780
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,240
can see

781
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,720
all that could have been said and i hope

782
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,320
annuals and you'll see

783
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,760
what you and i hope that you see what

784
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
you've uh what you want to learn more of

785
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,399
and

786
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,840
and i hope that you'll ask these in the

787
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,760
upcoming questions and hope that you've

788
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,200
that you enjoy the ride as you pursue

789
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,600
bio printing if that's your fancy

790
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,720
also i'm listening to work of people

791
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
from my uh from my lab at odu in the in

792
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,399
the section below in order the first

793
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,240
paper describes the adaption of a

794
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
low-cost 3d printer for precise cell

795
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,159
placement along with characterization

796
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,159
there and you'll find the affirmation

797
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,840
link to how to print the parts to make

798
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,159
it an accessory for converting a 3d

799
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,919
printer into a buyer printer along with

800
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,559
useful characterization oh yeah along

801
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,880
with additional info the next is a paper

802
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
that discusses the consistent

803
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,840
reproducible 3d culturing of mammary

804
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,760
epithelial structures uh using our

805
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,399
bioprinting platform that is after all

806
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,679
that is a paper that uh describes

807
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,200
hernias oh oh sorry i misread after that

808
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,279
is a paper that describes the printer as

809
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,039
a platform for making termoids and

810
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,799
chimeric memory organoids that can be

811
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,880
mechanically analyzed

812
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
the paper after describes the culture of

813
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,480
3d vibrant organized and human derived

814
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,640
and other xl matrices i also have some

815
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,919
publications in the works that scribes

816
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,360
on my phd work but that'll go and said

817
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,120
for now respect for my team all these

818
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,720
works are important as an example of

819
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,279
reproducible science and as a basis

820
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,919
and as a basis for and as a basis for

821
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,760
these works lie in a 3d printer that can

822
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,159
be programmed to print more precisely

823
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,360
and the team will see it through

824
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,080
so once again i thank you all if you

825
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,520
have any questions please forward them

826
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,840
to x bio x polymer protonmail.com

827
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,720
and um

828
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,799
there's one more thing

829
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,720
a lot of y'all present might say well

830
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,279
this talk is well as well and neat but i

831
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,360
don't have a space to prese to do any of

832
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,840
this work or any material training etc

833
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,760
don't worry we have you for those

834
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,279
looking for a space to do perform buyer

835
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,440
printing or any uh related bio work

836
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,399
there are places to consider

837
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,240
domestically internationally above is a

838
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,960
non-exhaustive list of groups

839
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,279
sorry

840
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,760
above yeah

841
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,520
a non-exhaustive list of groups to check

842
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,640
out not everyone listed has uh dedicated

843
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,520
sp specifically specially or specific

844
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,039
not iran has specifically dedicated

845
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,960
teams for bioprinting but they are

846
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,840
community biased space where you can

847
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,080
meet cool people who may and eventually

848
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
form a working group startups often come

849
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,200
from this space as well so if you're

850
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
particularly innovative and hungry there

851
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,279
might be spots for you to reach out to

852
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,880
in new york city there's bionomic labs

853
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,960
biotech without borders and gen space

854
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,559
elsewhere

855
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,480
in usa there's bioblaze biocures

856

boss lab and more you can find

859
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,399
even more of these at biosummit.org

860
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,240
the contact information for biotech

861
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,520
boards listed to the right please know

862
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
that they're oh yes please not the lab

863
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,120
is uh

864
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,279
it's open to looking for folks to use it

865
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,279
i mean before to use it for tinkering as

866
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,159
well as

867
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,679
sharing the care of the common

868
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,080
infrastructure please contact danny chan

869
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,840
he's a lifelong talk with in fact you

870
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,679
can hear from right now on options that

871
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,279
exist danny will you please come to the

872
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,600
stage

873

all right uh thank you oh

874
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,279
thanks xavier

875
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,279
it's kind of nice this is my first hope

876
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,559
and uh xavier and i met at biosummit

877
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,600
um

878
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,840
uh maybe by summit certainly online i'm

879
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
not sure if we met in person 2019 but um

880
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,440
yeah i helped steward the lab uh biotech

881
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,399
without borders and so uh i just wanted

882
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,120
to

883
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,399
share some slides with you just to talk

884
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,000
about community biology and the lab that

885
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,919
we have in new york city in the hopes

886
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,679
that it might be useful for you to find

887
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,760
either your own spaces in your own

888
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,840
respective localities or check us out

889
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,080
um at some point in the future so you

890
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,039
know um community bio labs often also

891
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,760
called diy bio labs bio hack spaces bio

892
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,399
maker spaces um just a bunch of

893
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,760
equipment that's brought together

894
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,159
specifically for molecular biology is

895
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,760
typically the thing that people are

896
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
looking for

897
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,760
they're outside of academia and industry

898
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
but because the equipment is interesting

899
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,120
to scientists then you often get a bunch

900
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
of scientists coming through the space

901
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,640
because they're curious um

902
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,039
on how people are using it outside of

903
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,880
the spaces they're comfortable in

904
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,440
um it's a really cool opportunity to do

905
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,960
science in a sort of slightly different

906
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,840
way

907
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,519
um i want to share with you this

908
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,600
timeline that i put together about diy

909
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,279
biology because i think it's interesting

910
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,080
um context that you know labs have

911
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,840
always existed inside of our homes um

912
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
tinkerers and artists like uh like look

913
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,679
to new technologies to try to play

914
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,000
around with them dr steve kurtz is like

915
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
a well-known example because

916
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,679
they were they were making some art in

917
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,080
their in their home uh specifically

918
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,760
trying to call out sort of some

919
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,360
influence of the pharmaceutical industry

920
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,760
and our health in our healthcare life um

921
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
and the fbi took action against them

922
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,519
they were acquitted of all the charges

923
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,919
um but that sort of put this like chill

924
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,000
over the community in terms of like

925
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,760
should we have labs in our homes um i

926
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,159
think you should but uh

927
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,240
the fbi then reached out um into the

928
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,799
community to try to uh i guess

929
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,640
make sure they had some level of control

930
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,919
but actually from that meeting it

931
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,039
brought together a lot of different

932
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,399
people that were just like we should do

933
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,240
this and and it really more widely

934
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,720
popular popularized those ideas so in

935
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,679
2011 there's this website diybio.org

936
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,279
it's still available

937
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,480
thesphere.diybio.org has a nice map it's

938
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,919
a little bit out of date

939
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,840
um but yeah they they inadvertently

940
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
brought the community together started a

941
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,200
whole bunch of different projects open

942
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,559
insulin is a project you might have

943
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,679
heard of that's come out of this

944
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,399
community out of counterculture labs

945
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,960
of course companies want to

946
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,480
make money out of

947
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,120
diy biology or biology in general

948
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,799
venture capital funds have like emerged

949
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,799
to try to you know make use of that

950
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,080
there are still self-organized bio

951
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,000
biology conferences biosummit i think is

952
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
a good example of one

953
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,679
and there's also this program just one

954
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,760
giant lab where you can get microgrants

955
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,679
to do small projects and that was

956
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,679
incredibly successful over the pandemic

957
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,559
time

958
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,080
so biotech without borders we're

959
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,320
non-profit based in nyc we have this

960
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,799
mission sort of vaguely but you can read

961
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,720
about us more on our website

962
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,399
the whole idea is that you know it's

963
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,080
hard to maintain certain pieces of

964
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,919
equipment in your own home and so this

965
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,000
is a nice common place that you can come

966
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,799
so if members can

967
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,480
justify the purchase of a piece of

968
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,320
equipment or like something building out

969
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,399
something in our space

970
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,080
against our mission vision and values

971
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,679
then you're welcome to propose that to

972
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,079
the group and we can try to get it done

973
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,679
um so yeah so if you need to find me uh

974
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,159
those are some of my contact information

975
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,000
i'm also in the

976
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
the matrix chat and again thank you

977
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,159
xavier for giving me a chance to speak

978
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,599
and you should come back up and we

979
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,960
should answer questions together i think

980
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,440
awesome

981
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,320
we have about 20 minutes for questions

982
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,918
and we have one in the matrix chat

983
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,118
but you go ahead

984
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,719
yes

985
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,320
oh yes so essentially it was a 2d

986
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,960
culture to uh to farm the cells needed

987
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,280
but as long as the but uh

988
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
with this uh well i'm speaking the

989
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,079
context of how i've done my lab uh we'll

990
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,000
have like uh base media that's uh

991
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,440
already prepared as in you know there's

992
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
no fbs no other like active uh molecules

993
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
that would cause these cells to try to

994
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,800
like grow together or try to

995
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
connect prematurely um

996
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
you would then

997
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,320
you would then get those you would then

998
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,400
mix those together and you would uh

999
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,200
place those in your needle and uh

1000
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,480
place that into the bio printer and

1001
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,560
print away after you're uh after the

1002
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,320
rest of your setups uh done including

1003
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,599
your coding but

1004
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,920
i'm sorry i'm i'm exp i'm describing the

1005
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,320
entire process but yeah just mixing the

1006
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
uh cells that you farmed and

1007
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,400
uh with the base media and

1008
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
uh you uh continue from there

1009
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
yes

1010
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,960
indeed well i mean think of uh think of

1011
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
uh

1012
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,599
i would say what's a uh what is the food

1013
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,960
that you would that what are foods that

1014
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,359
you like

1015
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,880
i mean yeah yeah some examples do you

1016
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
want to give

1017
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
well

1018
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,359
uh the question well

1019
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,079
actually let me roll back a bit

1020
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,000
uh it really depends on exactly what you

1021
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,839
want to create if you're trying to let's

1022
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,119
say create

1023
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:35,839
a

1024
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,640
like

1025
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,240
food in a particular pattern let's say

1026
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,560
you want to i don't know take uh you

1027
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,839
know uh

1028
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,440
cells from you like your favorite animal

1029
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,520
or but

1030
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
better yet let's say you want to take

1031
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
various plant uh plant cells you want to

1032
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,640
put it in a

1033
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,880
new form a new shape you can do that

1034
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,000
with bioprinting and so um you can uh

1035
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,599
but of course someone just say that's

1036
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,520
you know food plotting but i'm leaving

1037
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,680
options open for people to you know be

1038
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,000
more exploratory with uh

1039
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,839
their food choices i understand there's

1040
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,200
a lot of traditions where people like

1041
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,440
their food raw and essentially

1042
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,240
you could well i'll stop there

1043
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,280
but ultimately depends on your

1044
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,839
creativity

1045
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,880
alcoholic yes if you place the

1046
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
strategically among sugars you can

1047
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
actually do something like that

1048
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,320
oh this is uh yeah that's going to go

1049
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
out of uh bioprotein i don't know if

1050
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,839
anyone has made anything that's like

1051
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,760
more alcoholic but i do know several who

1052
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,000
have you know made a beer that glows

1053
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
green or other colors which is you know

1054
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,240
used for saint patty's day which is

1055
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,920
pretty cool

1056
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,680
additional questions yeah we have one

1057
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,480
from the one wolf who wants to has a

1058
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,640
two-part question

1059
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,400
the low-cost buy printer you said did

1060
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,599
you say it was like a thousand five

1061
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,760
hundred dollars or like what's the price

1062
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
for a starter there's some are even

1063
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
cheaper i would say are you talking

1064
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,079
about the commercial ones are we talking

1065
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,400
about commercial just oh okay and he

1066
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,480
also wants to know what or they want to

1067
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
know what would be your first project in

1068
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,680
bioprinting like what would be a good

1069
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,000
starter project all right a good starter

1070
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,839
project is one that uh biocurious did

1071
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,440
where they were just uh they were just

1072
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
printing like their name or words

1073
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,839
sequences and uh you know it with with

1074
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,119
ecoli that were uh that were made to uh

1075
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,320
glow green

1076
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
they um that's that would be a nice

1077
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
starter um just just printing just the

1078
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,640
shapes get to get your uh

1079
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,320
just get your uh get a handle on it and

1080
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,960
stuff but then over time i guess if

1081
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
someone wants to build you can look at

1082
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,320
creating uh you know like more complex

1083
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
tissues but yeah starting off with just

1084
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
uh simple like shapes patterns that's a

1085
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
fine one

1086
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,760
is there a was there not enough

1087
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,440
component to that question

1088
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,839
i nope that was it all right yes

1089
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,880
now that one nestle my answer that can

1090
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,520
be quite divisive because

1091
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,640
i want to answer that directly but i

1092
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,000
will say that there are a lot of

1093
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
structures out there that well they have

1094
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,240
the shape of the organ they or the or

1095
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,320
whatever they're trying to make but it

1096
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,560
is it's not really that functional

1097
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,040
and if you zoom in some parts are not

1098
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,560
that biomimetic

1099
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
um

1100
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,280
and i think that's important why we

1101
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,800
focus on the

1102
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,480
i think that's that draws importance to

1103
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,800
why we focus on you know getting these

1104
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,960
smaller details right understanding all

1105
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
these like salsa interactions and so and

1106
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,640
also that's why it's important that for

1107
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,079
a lot of printers if you're trying to

1108
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,359
look

1109
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,520
if you're trying to generate

1110
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,760
some features

1111
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,040
yeah you want to

1112
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,640
make sure you want to make sure that

1113
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
you're getting it from the bottom up

1114
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,880
otherwise it

1115
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,000
it's hard to

1116
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
it's hard

1117
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
it's hard for me to get for a lot of

1118
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
examples i'm thinking about

1119
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,320
it's hard for me to say that i actually

1120
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,520
would say that it's uh merits

1121
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,720
well

1122
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,079
there's a lot of ways i can go with this

1123
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,680
and all right but i'll say that um

1124
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,920
when you say the most complex tissue as

1125
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,720
in a functional one

1126
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,560
correct

1127
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,240
indeed i would say that uh

1128
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,960
i'd say the complex uh i say the complex

1129
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,839
organs that we or that we would find

1130
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,359
impressive well there's still some time

1131
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,560
away

1132
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,599
i'm also trying to avoid uh

1133
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,319
don't avoid go for it

1134
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,359
i'll think about it yes

1135
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,880
with the printers that i've mentioned

1136
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
i

1137
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,079
with some modification yes you could i

1138
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,319
mean yeah printing a tattoo is it's it's

1139
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,319
been it's done in but are you talking

1140
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,720
about like a tattoo out of living cells

1141
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,680
or just just tattoo period

1142
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,240
so so yes you're asking that too

1143
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,640
i mean

1144
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
i wouldn't say it's completely out of

1145
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,680
the question but uh i don't

1146
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,440
oh i actually see reasons why you might

1147
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
want to i mean yeah that's

1148
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
that's that's that's a possibility all

1149
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,680
depends on how you go about it

1150
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
but i like that question thank you

1151
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
yes

1152
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,920
oh yeah there's actually some um

1153
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,440
like in the last 10 years there's been a

1154
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,520
lot of really good research that's that

1155
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,920
that shows us like building that and so

1156
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,800
um

1157
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,520
i'm actually quite excited um

1158
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,839
based on those picture papers

1159
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,400
but uh yeah i'd say we're i'd say in

1160
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,720
next 20 years i think we will be very

1161
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,079
much uh

1162
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,839
i think we'll be very happy as if we as

1163
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,000
long as we managed to avoid blowing each

1164
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,960
other up

1165
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,240
but that's that's as far i'll say there

1166
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,400
any additional questions

1167
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,880
oh yes

1168
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,880
what do you think about that how does

1169
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,960
that influence your research

1170
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,839
wait a second one more time

1171
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
for my research and well for my outgoing

1172
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,640
uh for my outgoing research for my lab i

1173
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,240
mean i can't say really effects much

1174
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,000
because that's you know that's done and

1175
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,560
that's then done but going forward for

1176
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,960
just the i guess average enthusiast or

1177
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,760
people looking to

1178
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,400
over people looking to um

1179
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,000
to innovate i i mean if you're not a

1180
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,520
company i think oh if you're not a large

1181
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,280
company i'd say that would be troubling

1182
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,359
um but if you're a large company uh gosh

1183
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,960
that's that's something to be happy

1184
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,560
about

1185
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,720
but i'm you know

1186
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,599
i am not a large company

1187
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,599
yes

1188
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,359
well i'd say

1189
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,280
i'd say yes there is work that has in

1190
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,960
general uh you know held back the

1191
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,119
community uh if we look back to the

1192
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,599
earliest 3d printing tech

1193
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,640
you know there were a lot of uh i mean

1194
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,520
there were a lot of uh

1195
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,200
there were a lot of legal implements

1196
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,720
that held back a lot of innovation for a

1197
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,520
while

1198
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,880
and

1199
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,119
and not as foundational to

1200
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,359
uh you know to the more complex work so

1201
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,960
i'd say that uh

1202
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,720
yeah there's i mean there's a there's

1203
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,800
there's a lot legally which has been

1204
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,359
problematic for a research like overall

1205
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,160
yes

1206
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,280
anything that's holding back fundamental

1207
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,760
or uh foundational aspects

1208
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,880
of our

1209
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,200
like of our either hardware or hardware

1210
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
development or even or software

1211
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,560
development

1212
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,040
can be an obstacle

1213
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,680
yes

1214
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,280
i have a question about your research

1215
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,359
like certainly uh you said you printed

1216
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,000
in place in the matrix indeed yes like a

1217
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,319
lot of printers out in the research they

1218
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,520
uh you know they print the cells with

1219
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,880
the acm and often and in a lot of a lot

1220
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,280
of 30 printers uh well bio printers

1221
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,440
there are they're

1222
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,359
basically through their method it's hard

1223
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,640
to really calculate how many cells

1224
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,599
you've actually laid within and

1225
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,359
that could be a problem uh for our for

1226
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,599
our work we uh print the cells directly

1227
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,920
into the ecm which is already prepared

1228
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
and so i'm curious like the exit track

1229
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,680
the exit track

1230
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,160
from coming out of the ucm or whatever

1231
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,079
and uh like how does that limit the

1232
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,760
designs that you can do

1233
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,000
or is it not a problem at all

1234
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
um it doesn't it's not really well for

1235
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,280
the

1236
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,079
for

1237
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,280
how are

1238
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,680
so for how i'm outgoing lab uh does that

1239
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,200
work that's yeah that's that's not a

1240
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,160
problem

1241
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,760
for people looking to

1242
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,240
yeah for for our lab that's the way that

1243
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,160
the outgoing track is it's not it's not

1244
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,319
a problem currently and for other labs

1245
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,720
and other uh teams

1246
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,280
it might get very well uh

1247
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,079
well very it very well uh could be but i

1248
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,440
mean ultimately i'd say i mean

1249
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,400
well i can i guess i can only answer

1250
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,079
that question and i answer that question

1251
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,000
in the scope of my lab because

1252
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,319
everybody's uh everybody's project will

1253
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,920
require a different might require a

1254
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,200
different type of printer and it might

1255
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
require a different uh type of uh

1256
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,119
modification to set printer

1257
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,720
so it's yeah i have to answer in there

1258
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,079
in our context and i'd say it's not a

1259
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,319
problem

1260
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,800
did they it came out and went back in

1261
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,839
for every

1262
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,079
deposition or does it drag oh no it

1263
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,920
comes back out and then prints another

1264
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,359
location comes out

1265
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,720
like that

1266
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,079
and uh yeah the

1267
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,359
the uh

1268
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,760
the uh the organoids are able to uh

1269
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,839
perform uh quite quickly and without uh

1270
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,279
without it without a lot of problems

1271
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,799
i would um oh yes

1272
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,400
in the context of like our lab's work we

1273
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,680
you know we print like per injection um

1274
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,480
we can print as few as oneself we need

1275
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,200
to so but usually for like my for like

1276
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,280
my work uh we're printing uh you know

1277
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,760
more than that per injection um but

1278
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,200
easily i can

1279
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,440
with the way that we uh

1280
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,520
the way with the way that we uh

1281
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,119
extrude ourselves with the way that we

1282
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,440
plan our prints you can get a rough idea

1283
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,920
of exactly how many cells you are place

1284
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,839
again per per print per well

1285
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,280
yes

1286
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,640
so i'm going to ask

1287
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,440
a

1288
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,839
how far do you think that we are from

1289
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,200
being able to

1290
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,800
take something like a fairly

1291
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,400
biologically simple

1292
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,319
organ in the body like for example the

1293
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,280
heart how close are we to being able to

1294
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,920
3d print something or bioprint something

1295
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,599
of that nature

1296
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,280
is it something that is

1297
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,000
a few years out is it 10 years out is it

1298
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,319
a long time

1299
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,720
um

1300
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,599
that apparent that that depends on a lot

1301
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,960
of uh

1302
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,800
gosh that there are a lot of uh

1303
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,599
fundamental uh

1304
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
a lot of fundamental uh

1305
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,480
understandings that need to be

1306
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,079
that need be filled before we i guess

1307
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,839
before i can

1308
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,000
well

1309
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,599
there's a lot of work ahead um in order

1310
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,520
to get one that's functional one that

1311
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,160
you would

1312
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,920
to get one that's uh functional that you

1313
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,160
would feel comfortable replacing i mean

1314
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,319
i wouldn't i mean uh one estimate that

1315
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,839
i've seen from one researchers was about

1316
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,680
25 years and from the research that i've

1317
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,440
seen i more or less agree with that and

1318
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,800
so um but again this can because of how

1319
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,640
how how

1320
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,640
in predic unpredictably science may

1321
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,000
change in terms of when certain

1322
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,160
advancements are found and how

1323
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,720
that could be closer or farther it's

1324
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,520
really hard to say

1325
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,000
so like a lot of these like time

1326
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,359
these time estimates these are just

1327
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,440
ballparks and we're assuming that we're

1328
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
assuming a certain rate but we really

1329
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,920
don't know

1330
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,160
yes indeed

1331
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,040
someone who wants to get started with

1332
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,839
bioprinting um you know it might be

1333
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,839
helpful for someone like me who has no

1334
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,119
knowledge to work

1335
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,280
yeah um yeah i would say that there are

1336
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,000
members so like so my my academic

1337
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,760
experience is in infectious disease

1338
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,920
microbiology and in the course of that

1339
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,960
work like i prepared 3d skin models so

1340
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
not through bioprinting but just through

1341
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,760
like

1342
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,079
depositing cells on an extracellular

1343
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,760
matrix and manipulating it in a way so

1344
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,079
that it would make a tissue structure

1345
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,280
um

1346
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,119
so i mean there are various people that

1347
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,960
come through the doors that have some

1348
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,800
experience but we're not organized

1349
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,400
formally to like distribute that

1350
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,640
experience to folks the idea is that you

1351
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,720
come and you spend time with us like you

1352
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,240
talk about your project and we hang out

1353
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,079
and we like say oh yeah that sounds fun

1354
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,200
we should try to do that that's like

1355
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
within our grasp i think we're really

1356
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,880
looking for projects that are within our

1357
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,680
grasp given the materials that we have

1358
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,680
um in terms of like specific so like

1359
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,119
there's been a lot of focus talking

1360
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,160
about

1361
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,480
cell bioprinting here like a mammalian

1362
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,640
cell bioprinting so we have the

1363
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,640
facilities to do such a thing

1364
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,240
we would probably ask people that not

1365
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,720
use human cells is like one of our

1366
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,520
like one of our bio safety practices

1367
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,880
um

1368
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,400
but like there's also bio printing like

1369
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,599
you sort of touched on and there was a

1370
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,440
yeast question and something was asked

1371
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,200
about the breadth of bioprinting you can

1372
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,800
also bioprint with the extracellular

1373
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
matrix taken from bacteria

1374
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,280
um and and so like there are also there

1375
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,200
are other structures that can be made

1376
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,760
those structures can be thought of as uh

1377
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,440
like i think you in your in your

1378
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,359
presentation you said micro environments

1379
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,240
right like different types of

1380
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,720
environments different ways of like um

1381
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,640
doing chemistry that requires the

1382
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,480
isolation of certain bacteria from each

1383
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,440
other so that they pass off reactions

1384
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,319
so there's a lot of space to be explored

1385
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,839
it might not be

1386
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,000
necessarily tissue culture

1387
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,400
yeah and and you do mention it sounds

1388
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,599
challenging

1389
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,520
oh yes

1390
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,680
thank you danny

1391
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,118
oh oh yeah a question

1392
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,960
oh yes you have a question um

1393
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
indeed

1394
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,960
indeed uh and

1395
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,040
and those two those will require like

1396
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,200
many rounds of testing before those will

1397
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,480
be uh

1398
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,520
well they're currently so many uh like

1399
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,520
many organs grown on pigs those are in

1400
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,240
testing but yeah it'll be a while before

1401
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,040
we uh before i guess we're

1402
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,280
we're comfortable with those um in us

1403
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,400
it'll be a while that's why it's go

1404
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,400
ahead as far as

1405
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,440
certainly

1406
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,440
uh

1407
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,400
indeed that complexity is yeah there's a

1408
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,240
lot of work needed to just to get that

1409
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,880
just right and i understand

1410
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,160
many of the reasons why a lot of people

1411
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,720
just want to you know try to print uh

1412
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,559
you know what we have and just place it

1413
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,359
in but that would not be very that would

1414
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,200
not be helpful uh you know for the

1415
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,800
person and nor would it really be that

1416
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,640
functional hate to say it

1417
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,200
but also in terms of reliability

1418
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,640
and numbers

1419
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,680
it's

1420
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,760
yeah it's not uh not it's it's something

1421
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,440
worth taking our time with

1422
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,680
so we can get it properly right

1423
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,078
oh yes

1424
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,640
excellent thank you

1425
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,760
any additional questions

1426
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,160
any additional comments

1427
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,680
all right

1428
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,078
thank you all

1429
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,119
you
