12
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,759
out that your hdmi cable was the problem

13

uh i'm just going to do a real quick

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
audio check since like we were literally

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,400
running around trying to figure that out

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,520
so this should not be loud but

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
i'd like to make sure

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,000
that it's okay

i won't jack this up too loud uh for the

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,280
sake of the av guys but uh if the if

28

uh i really can't see any hands so i'm

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
probably gonna ask you to make noise

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
instead of like

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
raise your hands or whatever who came to

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,560
a previous demo scene panel

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,400
all right

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,879
how many of you come to just one or did

41
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,760
you watch the one last uh hope online or

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,800
okay

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
um i'm i'm a very

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
i don't know um

45
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
maybe maybe i'm not a

46
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,400
unique presenter but i i prefer that

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
people talk to me and

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,879
yell at me and you know like whatever so

49
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
that's that's fine

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
uh this is intended to be entertaining

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
but also you know so that you can learn

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,959
something so

53
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
uh hopefully we'll do a little bit of

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
both uh i promise not to get too

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,879
cerebral if you have a question

56
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,760
uh you can ask it you know like uh maybe

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,599
i'll i'll try to like stop at the end of

58
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
any slides or you know every couple

59
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
slides and just ask if i've you know

60
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,680
lost anyone or whatever

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
um the beginning of the of this we're

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
gonna careen

63
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,080
through because most of it is demo scene

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
history

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
can you make some noise if you came here

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,959
and you have no clue what the

67
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,280
demo scene is

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,799
don't be shy if you don't know what the

69
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
demo scene is i want to hear from you

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,879
um

71
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
but um this this is just an amazing uh

72
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,360
computer art and music and programming

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
and everything scene that

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
i find fascinating i'm a part of the

75
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,519
scene

76
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,959
most of the stuff that you're seeing

77
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,759
tonight is not my work uh i think i

78
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,358
might make a sneak appearance in one or

79
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,639
two things

80
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
um but uh this is this is not me even

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,199
though you probably you might be here

82
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
because you got a slip of paper from me

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,280
in the vendor room selling chiptunes or

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
something like that so

85
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,720
i just i want to make sure that that's

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,639
clear i'm kind of trying to put my scene

87
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,479
on a pedestal not me

88
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,360
um

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
so uh why don't we just go ahead and get

90
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
started because i just put myself uh 15

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
minutes behind schedule accidentally

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
um so there there are some uh

93
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
flashing lights

94
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
flashing colors

95
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
uh if you are photo sensitive if you

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,759
have epilepsy or whatever maybe this

97
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,600
panel is not for you

98
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
uh or hopefully you've taken your meds

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,240
so uh be careful please i i don't want

100
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,960

101

151
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,759
still relevant and that's how we're

152
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,599
going to catch everyone up hey here's a

153
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,039
pretty picture

you know uh here's another pretty

155
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,400
picture you should look at you know like

156

all right uh you know here's one more

157
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800

158
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
algorithmic this one doesn't what if i

159
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
told you hey

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,319
we just watched something about movies

161
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,720
and hackers right anyway um

162
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
so uh

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
you know like all of that

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
doesn't fit on maybe a piece of paper

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
this tiny but

166
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
these these are pretty small programs

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
and so i want to give you an example

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
of an incredibly small program

169
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,639
uh we'll show you one demo just like

170
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
right up front

171
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
this is something that

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
can i just like fling you onto my other

173
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
display that would be really nice

174
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
hello there we go

175
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,599
here's a dos demo

176
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,120
did did everyone catch the file size

177
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,580
just now

178
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:02,000
[Music]

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
we've got audio

180
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,840
we've got a

181
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,160
rotating heat map

182
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,680
[Music]

183
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
it's 256 bytes

184
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,240
you can write tweets longer than this

185
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,360
it's pretty wild

186
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,520
granted that's all it does most of these

187
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
that are this small are just kind of

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,200
looping animations and sound possibly

189
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,719
that do something like this but

190
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,839
the music is very apt yeah it's like

191
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,260
think about the possibilities

192
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,959
[Music]

193
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,640
and then it ends because someone hit

194
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
escape or you know it crashes after a

195
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
certain amount of time

196
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,040
all right so um let's let's talk about

197
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
this just a little bit more i want to

198
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,399
catch up

199
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,160
uh does does anyone in here not know

200
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,399
uh about this this thing that computers

201
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,160
can do called communicate with other

202
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,600
computers

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,560
um

204
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
these days this is really easy but maybe

205
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,959
i should rewind just a little bit

206
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,200
uh so you know back in the tape we're

207
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
writing software and it's on paper tape

208
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
uh and we're using computers that look

209
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
like giant refrigerators and then

210
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
eventually we move on to the computers

211
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,279
that need refrigerators et cetera et

212
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,040
cetera but uh really we're just trying

213
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
to exchange ideas

214
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,040
so uh actually i think i like that one

215
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,519
better i don't i don't know which one

216
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,399
one two one two

217
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
one you like this okay

218
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,120
so so back in this era right here

219
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,000
um the internet looks like this um it's

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,519
not very big

221
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,000
um and eventually it gets a little bit

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
bigger but uh you know i mean this this

223
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
is good at least i don't have to figure

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,160
out the ip address is very

225
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
it's it's not difficult to get in touch

226
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,839
with your neighbor right um in fact it's

227
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,519
really not difficult to get in touch

228
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,200
with your neighbor your neighbor

229
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,839
uh will get connected to you by uh you

230
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
know a pretty girl behind a console like

231
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,519
this and you're using you know

232
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,279
a phone that looks like that all right

233
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
so eventually

234
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,360
uh

235
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
we we move into the future a little bit

236
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,640
and the internet starts looking a little

237
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
bit more like this and uh that's that's

238
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
pretty cool

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,959
uh and i i especially am appreciative

240
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,880
that texas

241
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,000
is just a place and utah is just you

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,760
know like can i tell that ntu utah

243
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
yeah

244
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
you can also telnet into illinois

245
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
i don't know

246
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,760
just some guy

247
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,200
there's also gunter down here

248
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
i think he's i think they might have

249
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
misplaced a dot from germany and just

250
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
put it in the u.s now um this is this is

251
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
pretty fascinating era

252
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
where

253
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
uh you know i mean

254
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,839
in the late 60s uh open source gets its

255
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,600
start with

256
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
anyone

257
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,360
maybe a little bit of eunuchs and maybe

258
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,959
well and there's plenty of patent and

259
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,640
governments i'm sure but

260
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,959
uh also with space war

261
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,399
so you know

262
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,200
mit gets their first uh pdp a pdp one

263
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
one computer for the whole school

264
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,399
uh and they decide that they're gonna

265
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,680
have a housewarming party for their

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
computer because they're a bunch of

267
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,079
nerds

268
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,720
um and uh it turns out that wine and

269
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,640
cheese doesn't keep someone in one place

270
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,399
for four hours unless there's a whole

271
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
 ton of wine and cheese so they

272
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
decide they're gonna write a video game

273
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,200
for the pdp-1 and it's also going to be

274
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
a burn-in test for the pdp-1 so

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,519
instead of finding out four years down

276
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,760
the line that that resistor was

277
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
uh they can just you know like find out

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
that that resistor is dead now

279
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
eventually other schools start getting

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,839
their computers and they're connected to

281
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,639
this

282
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,920
internet thing

283
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,320
and uh you know they're like hey we just

284
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
got a pdp one can we test it and start

285
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,079
getting

286
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,480
space war over the internet and you know

287
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,000
they call up mit and they're like hey we

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
made it so that if you hyperspace too

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
many times your ship blows up isn't that

290
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
cool and they start passing around the

291
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
code and it gets better and now then

292
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
eventually we end up with computer space

293
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
and gravity game

294
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
uh which are the arcade versions of

295
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
space war so this is a burn-in test it's

296
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
party entertainment

297
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,760
and

298
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,160
it's open source software sort of that

299
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
you know ends up in the hands of other

300
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,560
schools

301
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,800
um mad hacks so you would have to get

302
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,639
this directly from someone over the

303
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,079
internet somehow

304
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,639
uh but you know like

305
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,639
maybe you didn't go to school maybe you

306
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,399
hate school maybe you're just you know

307
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,920
stuck at home and you want to reach out

308
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
and touch someone some other way maybe

309
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
you have something like this

310
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,079
you know so um

311
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,839
you know if you've got one of one of

312
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,440
these things on the right

313
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
uh i don't know what that is i think

314
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
they call it a phone

315
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,600
um

316
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,279
and uh you know maybe you've got some

317
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
floppy drives or a commodore or

318
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
something like that and

319
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
uh in this era uh for those that don't

320
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
know again probably half of the room

321
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,639
does but

322
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,240
it's actually against the terms of

323
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
service with the phone company to

324
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,200
connect anything to your phone line

325
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,399
um so

326
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,480
this isn't just like you know

327
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,279
dade in hackers where he's like you know

328
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,720
got an injunction against him or

329
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
whatever

330
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,519
you know you you actually sign up for

331
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,920
phone service and they bring you a phone

332
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,839
when they hook up your line and this

333
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,519
this gets eliminated kind of in the

334
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
beginning of the 80s you know people

335
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,279
actually start having phone jacks in

336
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,360
their home and they've rescinded

337
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
the policy that you can't plug anything

338
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
into the phone line but for now let's

339
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,519
pretend that this is still uh you know

340
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,040
something that is required and you're

341
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
renting your phone kind of like you know

342
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,839
if you have a cable modem or whatever

343
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,600
they make you rent it they don't make

344
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,839
you rent it but they they strongly

345
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,120
encourage

346
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
uh you to rent your cable modem right so

347
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
you everyone the problem is is that if

348
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
they've got to deliver millions and

349
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,199
millions of phones

350
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,800
uh to people in their homes then they're

351
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
gonna deliver this phone over here

352
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
and it's going to look the same in

353
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
everyone's house and because it looks

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,680
the same maybe

355
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
you'll come up with some sort of device

356
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
with a microphone and a speaker that you

357
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,120
can just drop the phone on hey i didn't

358
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
connect anything to my phone line

359
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,880
uh you know i just got one of these

360
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,399
plugged into my computer and it listens

361
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,839
to the phone every once in a while it's

362
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
like an answering machine you know

363
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,440
um

364
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
that ends up being a great idea so

365
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
you do this

366
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
and by the way a bunch of these are like

367
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,519
some of them are

368
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,040
images i blatantly ripped off of the

369
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,120
internet but stuff like this is stuff

370
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
that you can see in the museum

371
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
so

372
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
here's a cool ass 300 baud modem if you

373
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,279
open this door there's actually a sewing

374
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,720
kit behind here that you can repair the

375
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,199
modem with which is pretty wild

376
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
um so i just thought you'd like to see

377
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,959
that but uh here here you go here's a

378
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,519
micro modem 100 like the first

379
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
haze modem right and you've got these

380
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,680
pins over here that you literally just

381
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,760
take those pins and plug jumper wires

382
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,720
into this

383
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,120
and hook it up to phone wire so there

384
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,199
there you go you know here's some other

385
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
internal modems actually these have

386
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
phone jacks so this would be post that

387
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,920
era right

388
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
some other modems i've got

389
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,680
who had a sportster or a courier

390
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,800
all right good who had the competition a

391
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,000
not so smart modem

392
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
wow dead air good everyone had us

393
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,920
robotics uh

394
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
so meanwhile in chicago right um there's

395
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,880
the cbbs and cbs uh bbs actually

396
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
probably just stands for computer

397
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,120
bulletin board system but also

398
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
uh a dude named christensen and also

399
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,040
chicago so there's like all these things

400
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,759
that start with c that cbbs could be

401
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,839
um you know he's like i'm just gonna

402
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
like drop a computer on the phone and

403
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,160
like let people call it here's my number

404
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
you know whatever you dial in and you'd

405
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
see something like what's on the screen

406
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
i'm moving my mouse cursor around but i

407
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,199
bet you can't see it

408
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,639
um

409
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,360
is there a pointer thing in the uh

410
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,639
no there isn't

411
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
oh well i'm anyway

412
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,279
um

413
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,399
so

414
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,399
you dial into this computer bbs and this

415
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,079
guy would just like let you use this

416
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,519
computer sounds cool right uh in other

417
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,600
parts of the world you'd end up here's a

418
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,399
uh on the left is a french minitel

419
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,480
terminal and on the right is an angel

420
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,399
note which is a little

421
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,360
businessman briefcase model uh basically

422
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
the minitel thing on the left but it

423
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
gives you on ntt data

424
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,000
which is uh an information service

425
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
that the phone company offers that you

426
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,160
can do a lot of the same things that you

427
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,920
can do on minitel and what can you do on

428
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,839
minitel a lot of the things that you do

429
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
on the internet you know look at ads um

430
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,279
you know no um you can do online banking

431
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,680
or stocks or you know send messages or

432
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,839
even do something that i think a lot of

433
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,240
people would consider new you can order

434
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,959
food on minitel like this is not

435
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,279
actually a new thing uh so

436
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,839
anyway ntt data is now the the company

437
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,199
that you know like if you're a teemo

438
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,800
customer and you go to japan and turn on

439
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
your phone uh you'll connect to ntt

440
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
instead it's just the japanese phone

441
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,679
company

442
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,240
that you would get data service from but

443
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,079
by the way everyone knows what at t

444
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,400
stands for right

445
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,439
someone wants to shout it out

446
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,839
so what is

447
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,400
ntt

448
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
correct okay there we go

449
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
all right this is interactive right

450
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,000
um so

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
all right so serial port because we just

452
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
experienced serial killer

453
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,320
you call one of these other systems that

454
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,919
might just be run by someone that's

455
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,360
maybe a little bit more off they're not

456
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
than the government

457
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
maybe the government is off they're not

458
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
i don't know um but you get all these

459
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
sort of

460
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
interesting

461
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
things you know it's like

462
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
suddenly someone figured out how to call

463
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
another computer right like wait a

464
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,000
second

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,360
anyone ever seen any of these

466
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,600
this thing called compuserve you know

467
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
like we're starting to discover

468
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
who remembers this

469
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
i actually really liked prodigy

470
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
can i tell you a really good joke that

471
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,360
doesn't work anymore

472
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,080
um you used to be able to tell

473
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,160
someone you could say uh you know is

474
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
prodigy a band or an information service

475
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,679
and be able to figure out how old they

476
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,480
are

477
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,799
but now you can't do that anymore

478
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,240
because you say what's prodigy and

479
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,559
they're like

480
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,559
what

481
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,320
that's really actually it's really

482
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
disappointing because i like the prodigy

483
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,120
and i also like prodigy um

484
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
here's one of those things i got a

485
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,200
exclusive screenshot in the corner here

486
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,520
did anyone ever use aol for dos

487
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
down here in the corner is aol for dos

488
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,799
but most people probably use this

489
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
up here

490
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,200
aol for dos was blazing fast because

491
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,679
there was no windows overhead gdi is

492
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,039


493
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,240
um

494
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,400
and uh and here's an interesting thing

495
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,240
uh everything is related and everything

496
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,600
is a remix here's geos which is like

497
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,000
windows for your commodore 64.

498
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
if you can think about that for a minute

499
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,880
um and if you look back at the uh the

500
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,160
screenshot you notice how it kind of

501
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,720
looks like a new age version of geos so

502
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
this is geo works

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
geo works is like they they we're gonna

504
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
try and compete with windows and failed

505
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
miserably

506
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
but

507
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
you could actually get geos for a bunch

508
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
of different machines and operating

509
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
systems and run it

510
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,000
and

511
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,960
geos and your commodore 64

512
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
truth is stranger than fiction

513
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
aol didn't used to be call america

514
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
online it used to be called

515
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
q-link or quantum link

516
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,520
uh and if you've seen uh halton catch

517
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,240
fire where everything is like all j it's

518
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
like uh mother goose mix-ups except it's

519
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
with the i.t and tech industry

520
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
um it's actually a really good show i

521
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,360
like it a lot but um

522
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,919
here it is yeah like aol

523
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,640
negative five

524
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,320
and you could uh you can you can see the

525
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,000
beginning of instant messaging down here

526
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,280
in the corner

527
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
and chat rooms

528
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
and there was also this thing called

529
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,600
club career bay which also got released

530
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
as a standalone called habitat which is

531
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,840
recently

532
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,120
reverse engineered and revived so

533
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,799
if you want the earliest mmos

534
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,240
here you go

535
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
so we've got all these cool tools

536
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
to get online both dialing you know like

537
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
the nut job next door and

538
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,000
by you know like dialing into all these

539
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,320
commercial services and then people

540
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,480
start doing this amazing artwork right

541
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,559
where they're advertising their online

542
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,320
service that they run probably out of

543
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,080
their garage or basement or whatever i

544
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
should know i did one

545
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
um both the ansi art and running the bbs

546
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,720
actually because i didn't have any

547
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,600
friends um

548
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
you dial into one of these uh let's talk

549
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,480
specifically about bbs's now by the way

550
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,640
if you want the less fast version of the

551
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
bbs talk uh jason scott who i'm sure you

552
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,240
know

553
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,799
has a bbs documentary that is multi-part

554
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,679
and

555
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,120
absolutely amazing it's really good you

556
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,678
should watch it

557
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
you log in you can do the same that

558
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
you do on the internet you download

559
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,200
files

560
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,919
you can send messages you can play doors

561
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,919
you can post bulletins there's message

562
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,799
boards try to chat with people

563
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,480
chat with sysop doesn't always work

564
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,400
because the sysop might be like in

565
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,159
school because

566
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,000
he's not even a teenager yet

567
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
i'm making self-references here

568
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,159
uh

569
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,080
when you want to download files it might

570
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,760
look like this

571
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,720
you look through lists of files

572
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
you tag the file that you want to

573
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,480
download

574
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,919
you know so you could go over here and

575
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,840
say i want file number two and file

576
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
number five or whatever and then you

577
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,799
actually go to download it'll send you

578
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,919
your files

579
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,600
in the order you tag them

580
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,240
eventually you do something like this

581
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,919
oh hey it looks like i'm downloading

582
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,159
something i can run on my own dbs anyone

583
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,880
know what i'm downloading

584
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
excellent

585
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
you can also eventually get something

586
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,919
called rip term

587
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
which would give you graphics in this

588
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
like world of just text mode stuff

589
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
um you know this graphic is especially

590
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,039
relevant

591
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
not really um

592
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
but uh

593
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
but here's some some incredible rip term

594
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,080
art

595
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,840
so you download like vectors and

596
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,039
primitives

597
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,039
to draw real art like it's not

598
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,200
downloading raster images or pixels

599
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
because you know like downloading pixel

600
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,120
boobies takes you like

601
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,760
two hours

602
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
rip term could also it also had this uh

603
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,760
you know it could draw scroll bars

604
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
um you know and buttons and windows and

605
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,760
dialogs and this was really useful

606
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,520
because you know like

607
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
people that wanted a graphical interface

608
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
but didn't want to pay for aol finally

609
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
we can do this so you see stuff like

610
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
this and you can even download your own

611
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,799
rip art it's pretty great

612
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,000
um

613
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
also if you had rip term the files

614
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,159
section looked way better

615
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,320
right like you can actually like just

616
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
click on the files that you want and be

617
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,159
like download this is great

618
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,559
um and uh and so

619
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
there's this sudden divergence where you

620
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,760
know like

621
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
uh these people doing these antsy arts

622
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,559
for like login screens and bbs ads they

623
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,640
have to up their game right

624
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,799
and so they start upping their game in

625
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,320
the tech starts

626
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,480
department and then you've got the rip

627
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,960
term guys drawing new rip graphics and

628
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,400
there's a little bit of a game of leap

629
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,679
frog

630
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,760
but i want to go back to downloading

631
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
files for a second

632
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,440
i would download some stuff

633
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,520
i was a big music downloader

634
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,200
we're not talking about mp3s if you're

635
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,559
under whatever age that is

636
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,480
you download music

637
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
and it tells you what instruments are in

638
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,360
your music this is megamix88

639
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
uh you know has fun bass and whatever

640
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
these are all instruments that probably

641
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,640
someone ripped out of you know like a

642
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
korg or a roland or you know something

643
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,039
like that uh but every once in a while

644
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
you'd be like downloading these these

645
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,200
mod files that you listen to music

646
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
and you wouldn't get a list of

647
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
instruments you'd get like yo

648
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,440

i talked to him for like 30 minutes

673
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,520
about you know like his favorite local

674
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
pizza

675
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,279
and and whatever and then i get in

676
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,640
trouble with my mom for making long

677
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
distance phone calls uh but that's also

678
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
because i've been calling you know 30

679
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,159
billion bbs's and racked up like

680
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,840
hundreds of dollars

681
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,640
um

682
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,120
because i wanted to like follow

683
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
this path

684
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,919
of like discovering all of these

685
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,960
services that you know these people

686
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
call my bbs by the way here's your

687
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,480
legend of the red dragon on the right

688
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200
finally that download finished

689
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
trade wars was also a big deal back in

690
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
the day

691
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,159
early space trading and combat game

692
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,000
and uh and because these boards are

693
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
single line you'd actually play like a

694
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
couple turns of the game and leave your

695
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,720
ship like parked in the middle of space

696
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
hopefully with like shields or something

697
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,799
like that someone else can log in and

698
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,640
attack your ship

699
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,559
uh you know if you there there was

700
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,720
eventually multi-line

701
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,559
uh bbs's where multiple people could

702
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,000
play trade wars at once and that was

703
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,640
kind of a game changer and very wild

704
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,720
uh and apparently they still have like a

705
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
trade wars leaderboard

706
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,799
and uh i just went to

707
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,840
uh again this is like my life is so

708
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,799
weird um one of the guys is like a top

709
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,360
trade wars champion

710
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
lives down the street from the museum

711
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,720
and we went over and played arcade games

712
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,039
at his house the other day

713
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,158
i can't make this up

714
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,000
so

715
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
then there's this other thing that we're

716
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
doing with computers that has nothing to

717
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,600
do with getting a line

718
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,000
we love big box games

719
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
this is actually from the library of

720
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,799
congress so i guess i can't buy

721
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,559
games from the library of congress but

722
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,159
uh if that were a software store i'd

723
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,640
sure like to rip it off uh that the guys

724
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
on the other side opposite sides are

725
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,240
holding a copy of ultimate

726
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,880
or ultimate let's try that again ultima

727
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,200
uh because they are the coders of ultima

728
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
and they went to software etc and

729
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,880
egghead

730
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,000
you know before newegg

731
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,320
and bought their own game just so that

732
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,440
they could

733
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,960
be legit

734
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,679
but

735
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,720
again

736
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
you know not all of us can afford to

737
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,480
subscribe to an online service so not

738
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
all of us can afford

739
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
to go out and buy buy software so what

740
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,880
do we do

741
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,120
i moved this slide intentionally further

742
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
to the beginning closer to the beginning

743
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,000
because in the 2018 talk

744
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
are you here whoever it is that yelled

745
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
don't copy that floppy before i got the

746
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
chance to get here

747
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,960
um

748
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,840
anyway so yeah you you do that

749
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,520
and sometimes you get a really nice

750
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
pirated floppy here where you could uh

751
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,559
you could actually

752
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,559
you know get get instructions on how to

753
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,799
install your pirated game or you know

754
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,240
how to start it up just type this

755
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,960
someone's bart's tale character disc

756
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,480
wonder if it's any good

757
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,120
mind shadow you know load star comma e

758
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,559
comma one

759
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,000
if you only have one floppy drive you

760
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,039
don't need that comma one

761
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,919
so if you pirate a game

762
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,960
every once in a while you get a surprise

763
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,760
turns out

764
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
you know kong strikes back was cracked

765
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000

766
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,399

pirated by the freeze

772
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,360
i thought that was a superhero

773
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,399
crackers are trying to get attention

774
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,399
by putting their name somewhere so that

775
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,480
you know like obviously you know the

776
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
game is by someone else

777
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,240
uh but they they want you to know that

778
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,600
they cracked this there was copy

779
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,120
protection on here

780
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,840
or i i pirated this or i got the game

781
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,440
before it came out and

782
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,200
you know zero date it to all my friends

783
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,559
whatever

784
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
um

785
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,000
but every once in a while you see

786
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,799
something like this

787
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
you put in the floppy you start up the

788
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
game and instead of seeing the game

789
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,360
we're seeing like

790
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,679
the the pirate's name in the credits or

791
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,000
whatever

792
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,399
where is the mouse cursor there we go

793
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
instead of getting the game you get

794
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,840
stuff like this

795
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,159
little bit of epilepsy right

796
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,039
and you're like whoa this is how to be a

797

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,480
um

843
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,320
but they're talking about distribution

844
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,440
okay for us that was bbs's in europe

845
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,679
they had a few uh a few more balls than

846
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,840
we did like three or four

847
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,640
um

848
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,320
and they'd be sending discs around in

849
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,279
this

850
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,360
in the u.s we were petrified that we'd

851
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,480
like

852
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
get caught by the feds

853
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,279
but in europe they're passing around

854
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,840
with graffiti on

855
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,480
them it's pretty wild

856
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
to the point where

857
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,519
people are actually sneaking

858
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,080
these and other things notice we've got

859
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,240
on here charts option seven this is a

860
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,960
commodore 64 disc mag

861
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,240
anyone ever heard of a zine

862
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,480
so here we have one of those except it's

863
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,360
literally on a disc

864
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,320
and here's an amiga version

865
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,039
the artwork is awesome

866
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,799
there's usually a tune playing in the

867
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,039
background and you notice you keep on

868
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,200
seeing this word chart

869
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,399
and you're thinking like what are the

870
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,960
charts well it turns out

871
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,440
just like some sort of stupid sci-fi

872
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
movie where people are trying to do more

873
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,120
hacks than the other guy

874
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,399
and score

875
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,240
and like you know they're having a

876
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,840
competition of sorts this is legit

877
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,919
happening where they actually have

878
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,919
these charts of who has cracked the most

879
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,120
games this month or whatever

880
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
and it's real

881
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,919
and eventually you watch one of these

882
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,919
and uh they've got all sorts of scene

883
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,159
drama in these mags and whatever but you

884
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
look up here

885
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,640
and you see something else

886
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,799
right next to this like phone that's

887
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,960
hooked up to the at symbol

888
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,200
i see something interesting

889
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,639
anyone want to tell me what it is

890
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,760
right up here

891
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,520
party

892
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,239
sorry about that

893
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,599
hold on

894
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,760
i've been in my basement for like 10

895
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,040
years watching these there's and

896
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,399
someone's telling me there's a party

897
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,639
something happens here

898
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,520
people start going through all these

899
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,800
disc mags and finding out that in europe

900
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,280
people are having copy parties

901
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,919
and whatever

902
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,800
and they're showing

903
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,199
these cute little intros

904
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,560
and demos

905
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
and crack trolls

906
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,520
on the wall as like

907
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,240
party entertainment

908
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,079
come and pirate any software you want

909
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,400
it's a giant ass land party

910
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,280
with amigas

911
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,960
and people are watching this stuff on

912
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,440
the wall

913
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,800
this is 40k by the way

914
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,200
so there's like a technical aspect here

915
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
suddenly these hackers that are breaking

916
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,160
copy protection are able to get noticed

917
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,200
because

918
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,280
they're doing this like cool sort of art

919
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,280
thing

920
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,560
full screen animations in 16 colors this

921
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,240
is big for this era

922
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,240
but they've they've got all these like

923
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,839
cool effects

924
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,280
i mean they're they're decent right

925
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,800
this is the kind of stuff you'd expect

926
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,760
to see on the wall in a rave

927
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,520
and these guys say something

928
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,400
controversial

929
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
they're at a copy party right and this

930
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,480
is this is entertainment for the copy

931
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
party or for the lan party or whatever

932
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,079
you want to call it

933
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,560
everyone's pirating software

934
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,680
this shows up on the wall

935
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,040
people are into it they're watching it

936
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,599
and then they say

937
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,599
what's the point in cracking games it

938
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,359
only ruins the future of the amiga a

939
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,400
piracy is a crime

940
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,000
there are some that will say

941
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,480
that was a joke

942
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,200
but

943
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,680
some people pay attention to it and they

944
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,079
actually stop cracking games

945
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,400
and they decide that they've spent the

946
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
past you know five ten years trying to

947
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,000
like leapfrog the other guy's cool intro

948
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,240
thing

949
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,119
excuse me

950
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,119
the end um

951
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,760
and that's the end of my pal no um

952
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,040
so

953
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,200
you've got a couple people that are very

954
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,880
serious about cracking games and you've

955
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
got a couple people that are like well

956
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,520
you know

957
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,680
maybe they've got a point why don't we

958
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,720
just like stop cracking games

959
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,760
we've been

960
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,160
like at war with each other

961
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,640
to like figure out how to do the coolest

962
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,119
visual effects and whatever why don't we

963
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,119
just like come up with the coolest

964
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,880
visual effects we can fit them on a

965
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,680
floppy disk watch them at a party and

966
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,520
like we could even compete and vote on

967
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,200
them or something and they do

968
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
don't worry in germany they're still

969
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040
having copy parties

970
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,119
probably run by people that are 15.

971
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,359

1014
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,560
and the code

1015
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,079
it's very important to credit your

1016
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,079
artists

1017
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,599
music by benny b this might be how benny

1018
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,800
banassi got his start

1019
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,570
voltron and mr pet

1021
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,720
now the greetings

1022
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,079
so you gotta shout out your homies

1023
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,920
red sector is a good name that's still

1024
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,400
around

1025
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,930
and none of these other guys

1026
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,989

1027
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,640
we finally just got our phil collins

1028
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,598
drum breakdown by the way

1029
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,680
and

1030
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,919
and

1031
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,240
so this is what happens when you know

1032
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
you have a bunch of like 14 year old

1033
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,400
germans or something and they're like we

1034
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,560
can convince a hotel that we're going to

1035
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,760
have

1036
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,800
a piracy party

1037
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,200
in a hotel and it'll be fine and no

1038
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,160
police will show up

1039
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
even though we're specifying our address

1040
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
that's how it makes it legit i guess

1041
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,480
and what does this look like so this is

1042
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,280
what it looked like

1043
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,799
i want the feeling of 30 disk drives

1044
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,599
but these days it might look more like

1045
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,119
this

1046
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,720
what can you expect of these parties

1047
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,000
food

1048
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
tokyo demo fuss down here that's why

1049
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,839
you've got the weird japanese pizzas

1050
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,680
with mayo

1051
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,200
i believe that's river wash up in the

1052
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,359
corner which is in poland

1053
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,480
uh i'm i'm awful and i don't know what's

1054
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,800
up in the right i think the bottom is a

1055
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
food truck

1056
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,720
at revision

1057
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,920
that might be break point in the corner

1058
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,359
or something like that

1059
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,119
there's also sleeping arrangements this

1060
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,400
looks just like hope actually

1061
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,079
does anyone remember the hotel pen

1062
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,560
that's right here you don't have to

1063
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,960
forget

1064
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,839
uh it turns out these parties are

1065
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,160
actually pretty serious inside

1066
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,440
looks like one of the coolest lamb

1067
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,400
parties you've ever been to

1068
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,720
uh so

1069
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,119
is this possible with the u.s well kind

1070
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,079
of

1071
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,200
um

1072
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,680
these are every other week in europe at

1073
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,960
this point

1074
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
that people are doing this but we've got

1075
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,599
demo splash in pittsburgh over here

1076
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,839
we've got at party in boston

1077
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,160
uh it used to be in somerville at

1078
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,560
artisan's asylum but artisan's asylum is

1079
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
moving now

1080
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,720
so it will be in the new artisans asylum

1081
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,640
once it exists fully

1082
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,560
but

1083
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,000
it used to be that i would only shout

1084
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,760
out these two

1085
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,560
and i would forget to mention synchrony

1086
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
haha there's a slide with synchrony on

1087
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,760
it now

1088
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,480
synchrony starts in new york city at

1089
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
baby castles

1090
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,119
and you all hop on a train and you go to

1091
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,680
montreal and you write your demos on the

1092
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,880
train

1093
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,839
and you show them in

1094
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,760
montreal it's pretty cool

1095
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,800
um

1096
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,359
also an interesting addition is that

1097
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,560
revision

1098
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,480
which by the way i mean you saw how big

1099
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,920
that was right

1100
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,079
revision is probably the largest event

1101
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,480
assembly looks larger but half of it is

1102
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,960
like a lan and gaming party esports

1103
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,040
event at this point i think assembly is

1104
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,560
still pretty cool and it's also one of

1105
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
the og parties that i really wanted to

1106
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
go to

1107
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,280
but i was like 13 and my parents

1108
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,480
wouldn't let me go to finland

1109
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,520
hi mom

1110
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,000
but

1111
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,160
because of the pandemic

1112
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
you know like ain't nobody going to

1113
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
germany we were actually planning on

1114
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,599
going in 2020

1115
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,560
and

1116
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,760
wherever

1117
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,520
some of my friends are

1118
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,920
gonna make that trip

1119
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,839
see there we go so we we we already have

1120
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,000
plane tickets and then all the shutdowns

1121
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,920
happened and everything was

1122
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,319
um but an interesting thing happened

1123
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,680
revision transitioned to an online

1124
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,240
excuse me that was like a hiccup

1125
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,560
um an online interactive experience and

1126
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
they had actually been live streaming

1127
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,400
revision for you know i mean like four

1128
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,520
or five years or whatever they

1129
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,200
eventually got them themselves banned

1130
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,680
from twitch because uh you know like one

1131
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,760
of the demos had like three seconds of

1132
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,880
nipple

1133
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,720
um and uh so then uh ccc actually

1134
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,040
graciously picked up all the streaming

1135
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
and whatever and things went on

1136
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,560
kudos to them

1137
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,720
uh revision moves on they actually still

1138
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,880
stream on twitch they got reinstated

1139
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,720
things are pretty great

1140
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,880
this year they decided that they would

1141
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,720
set up satellite locations and the

1142
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
entire theme of the event was revision

1143
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,000
satellites

1144
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,400
and you could literally go to my museum

1145
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,640
and watch revision and participate in

1146
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,079
the event

1147
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,160
and everything and there were the these

1148
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,839
sprouted up all over the world there was

1149
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,760
you know one in the uk there was like a

1150
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,440
bunch of them in germany

1151
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,359
um and you could literally just go to

1152
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,280
revision and they even had

1153
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,440
uh what made this really kind of special

1154
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,839
is that the home office checked back

1155
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:35,599
in with all the satellites

1156
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,920
and you can see my ugly mug right in the

1157
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,040
middle there

1158
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
uh and you can see all of these

1159
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,640
different spots all over the world where

1160
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,359
people did this

1161
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,359
and it was just really nice it was nice

1162
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,319
to be

1163
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,880
and actually from a u.s standpoint

1164
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,200
europe has always been the serious scene

1165
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,800
people for this right

1166
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,920
uh and the us has not really we've been

1167
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,520
serious about the scene here but we're

1168
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,400
just so spread apart and like you know

1169
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
few and far between

1170
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,599
and whatever it's not like being you

1171
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,119
know a bunch of nerds packed together in

1172
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,640
germany or whatever

1173
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,119
uh so it was very cool actually for the

1174
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,839
us to receive recognition here

1175
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,079
but uh i want to i want to rewind a

1176
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,079
little bit and show you

1177
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,040
two extremely notable demos

1178
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,480
uh that

1179
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,040
we're going to just kind of skip through

1180
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
a little bit because what i want to do

1181
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,880
is get us to

1182
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,520
what's happening in the demo scene now

1183
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,119
not what happened in the demo scene in

1184
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,720
1992.

1185
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,480
uh the important thing to understand

1186
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,079
with what i'm about to show you is

1187
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,920
previously we've been watching stuff

1188
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
like what i just showed you right like

1189
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,359
they're simple intros they have some

1190
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,720
scroll text they might have some cool

1191
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,680
visual effects hey look at what i can do

1192
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,599
maybe even the scroll text says hey look

1193
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,280
at what i can do

1194
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
you know people are trying to show stuff

1195
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,200
off and suddenly in like roughly 1992

1196
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,839
uh we jumped to this sort of cinematic

1197
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,720
thing

1198
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,000
instead

1199
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,040
and so

1200
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,720
one of the first demos that i think

1201
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,640
anyone in europe will remember

1202
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,520
uh there are really two demos that blew

1203
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,760
the envelope wide open

1204
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,319
and one of them is desert dream on the

1205
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,040
there we go our amiga fans are awake all

1206
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,040
right

1207
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,899
[Music]

1208
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,559
and we'll watch like i don't know a

1209
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,920
couple minutes of this because it's

1210
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,160
really great

1211
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,099
[Music]

1212
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,459
[Music]

1213
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,839
[Music]

1214
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,240
screenplay written by

[Music]

1218
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,200
don't worry you don't have to like

1219
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,559
remember this it's not going to be on

1220
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,720
the test

1221
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:36,309
[Music]

1222
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,400
so

1223
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,960
[Music]

1224
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,970
often threatened by vegetables

1225
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,119
[Music]

1226
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,180
sounds very personal

1227
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:03,569
[Music]

1228
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,660
three

1229
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:18,949
[Music]

1230
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,640
that is a watermelon

1231
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,240
and that's how it ends if you eat

1232
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,200
watermelon i'm just saying

1233
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,150
[Music]

1234
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,670
[Music]

1235
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,900
[Applause]

1236
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,479
[Music]

1237
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:16,149
[Music]

1238
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,319
let this be a lesson do you push veggies

1239
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,558
on people

1240
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:43,440
[Music]

1241
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,720
introducing scene poetry

[Music]

1243
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,260
[Applause]

1244
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,520
so

1245
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:34,230
[Music]

1246
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,820
field

1247
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:44,399
[Music]

1248
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,760
here they say let's demolish some more

1249
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,839
they're making a reference to

1250
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,200
records

1251
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,760
they want to demolish more limitations

1252
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,520
and more records

1253
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,440
of what people have done with this

1254
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,810
machine so far

1255
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:30,720
[Music]

1256
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,440
make no mistake rotating twelve thousand

1257
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,559
dots

1258
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,520
takes a

1259
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,740
a ton of math

1260
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,920
[Music]

1261
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,839
and doing this at eight megahertz is not

1262
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,060
easy

1263
00:53:44,060 --> 00:54:38,079
[Music]

1264
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,650
this is cute right here

1265
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,829
[Music]

1266
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,420
sorry av guys

1267
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:57,280
[Music]

1268
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,280
so

1269
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:22,769
[Music]

1270
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:38,449
[Music]

1271
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,118
psych

1272
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,359
and then they ask you for disc two all

1273
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,160
right

1274
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,520
so

1275
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,640
i'm going to the next slide because

1276
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,599
uh

1277
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,040
how many amiga people do we have in the

1278
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,000
room at least five

1279
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,760
one

1280
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,400
i lost the other amiga people all right

1281
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,520
who was your primary rival

1282
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,760
that had better games than you or that

1283
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,440
you had better games than and you were

1284
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,839
constantly fighting back and forth

1285
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,359
what kind of computer did they have

1286
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,200
pc

1287
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,280
so there are these guys that are doing

1288
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,720
commodore 64 stuff

1289
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,200
and they realize maybe

1290
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,480
we should do some pc stuff

1291
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,359
what i want you to notice obviously some

1292
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,960
people in here have seen this can i get

1293
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,720
some shouts from people who have not

1294
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,839
seen this yet

1295
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,440
excellent

1296
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,119
i'm glad this is going to be new to you

1297
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,960
because this is

1298
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,280
quite possibly

1299
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,440
with alongside desert dream like these

1300
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,400
two demos are basically the demos

1301
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,480
that made us go from like

1302
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,839
piracy lan party to like indie film fest

1303
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,040
mode

1304
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,520
uh for for these demo parties so

1305
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,559
these guys are future crew

1306
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,520
and that was my slide

1307
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,920
hello

1308
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,040
click

1309
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,119
there we go

1310
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,440
and they decide to do

1311
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,760
now i don't really know if they saw

1312
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,000
desert dream and i should probably just

1313
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,079
ask them because i know some of them

1314
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,000
but

1315
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,599
you're going to notice some similarities

1316
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:26,400
here

1317
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,640
it's kind of like a remix of the other

1318
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,640
demo

1319
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,799
it's true actually

1320
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:10,138
[Music]

1321
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,720
so

1322
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:48,510
[Music]

1323
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,319
so

1324
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:17,820
[Music]

1325
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:39,599
[Music]

1326
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,810

00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:51,670
[Music]

1328
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,240
[Music]

1329
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,240

00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,079
[Music]

1331
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,079
so

1332
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,560

[Music]

1336
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,920
i spent years trying to figure out what

1337
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,280
this said

1338
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,480
it says

1339
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,800
another way to scroll

1340
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,440
[Music]

1341
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,000

[Music]

1345
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,410

01:01:52,410 --> 01:02:16,870
[Music]

1347
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,280
get down

1348
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,599
i think i spent about 10 years just

1349
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,760
staring at plasma animations and

1350
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,039
realizing

1351
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,039
that's like what i see when i close my

1352
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,079
eyes

1353
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,200
like when you're trying to look at

1354
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,839
something in your sleep

1355
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:58,890
[Music]

1356
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,400
whose spinning cube is better

1357
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,880
time will tell

1358
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:25,859
[Music]

1359
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,789
[Applause]

1360
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:52,569
[Music]

1361
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,949
[Music]

1362
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,599
10 seconds of transmission

1363
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:45,100
[Music]

1364
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,200
so

1365
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,150
[Music]

1366
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,680
[Applause]

1367
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,810
[Music]

1368
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:58,160
[Applause]

1369
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:07,678
[Music]

1370
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,559
and just when you don't think it can get

1371
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,599
any more complex

1372
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,039
they decide they're going to do one more

1373
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,120
thing

1374
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:21,620
[Music]

1375
01:05:30,590 --> 01:06:00,889
[Music]

1376
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:16,360
[Music]

1377
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,119
and then they give you a nice credit

1378
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,799
sequence

1379
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,960
so

1380
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,559
it's about at the point where everyone

1381
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,960
watches this spaceship animation and

1382
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,400
whatever

1383
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,520
in 1993 and they're like why aren't

1384
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,280
these guys making games this is better

1385
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,119
than any game i've played yet

1386
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,200
and what you don't realize is that has

1387
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,319
anyone ever heard of remedy

1388
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,559
entertainment

1389
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,130
flat out

1390
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,760
[Music]

1391
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,240
they made they ended up making that

1392
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,640
uh a bunch of these guys as anyone ever

1393
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,720
played bejeweled the guy that made the

1394
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,039
music right now

1395
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,799
that music ends up

1396
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,160
in some of the pop cap stuff

1397
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,280
uh

1398
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,440
the guy that made the technoe music that

1399
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,039
was playing earlier

1400
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,880
ends up rearranging a bunch of final

1401
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,240
fantasy music and going on tour

1402
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,200
and does it does video game concerts

1403
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,119
like these guys are still in the scene

1404
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,480
and they're still doing stuff that

1405
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,559
you've probably heard of

1406
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:23,920
3d mark

1407
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,640
written by these guys

1408
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,039
it was just a few years too early that

1409
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,839
they were doing this

1410
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,919
so

1411
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,960
at this point we should be

1412
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,839
understanding that these demos are

1413
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:47,760
something that we get on a couple floppy

1414
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,240
disks from a friend or

1415
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,160
uh that you know might even have been

1416
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,839
mailed to us we got from software the

1417
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,599
month club who knows

1418
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,160
um but you might have also gotten them

1419
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,960
from you know like uh you downloaded it

1420
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,280
from a pbs or something like that and

1421
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,119
there really is no purpose to these

1422
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,880
others other than that they wanted to

1423
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,039
show them at a demo party

1424
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,359
and show off their cool chops

1425
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,079
and do something cool and artistic

1426
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,520
is everyone on the same page

1427
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,560
okay

1428
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,359
and also that these are completely

1429
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,040
algorithmic there might be a couple

1430
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,880
animations in here

1431
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,640
uh you know but like there is a

1432
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,399
technical aspect to this these are all

1433
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,319
running on machines that are you know

1434
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,880
anywhere from like eight to thirty three

1435
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,080
megahertz

1436
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,080
is the range of computer that we're

1437
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,759
we're talking about with like you know a

1438
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,158
meg maybe two megs of ram

1439
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,759
something like that

1440
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,880
again we all on the same page

1441
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,158
okay

1442
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,000
does any anyone have any questions so

1443
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,238
far

1444
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,920
this is where we kind of descend into

1445
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,399
the next pile of slides

1446
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,520
is

1447
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,600
where i explain you notice

1448
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,439
did anyone catch on to the similarities

1449
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:04,399
between desert dream and second reality

1450
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,560
you see a lot of the same effects

1451
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,000
you start seeing a lot of the same

1452
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,960
tricks

1453
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,198
people are going back to their games of

1454
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,960
leapfrog again where they're like i saw

1455
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,520
that effect i can do it better

1456
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,198
i saw that scroller i think i can do a

1457
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,560
cooler one

1458
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,759
that sort of a thing and

1459
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,279
we start seeing

1460
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,759
just interesting stuff

1461
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,439
where we're you know like we're really

1462
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,640
trying to explain this is just art so

1463
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,960
uh these next slides actually most of

1464
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,158
these demos i showed in my uh the ones

1465
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,359
in the slides

1466
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,439
i showed in the 2020 presentation so if

1467
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:42,080

have 90 or so minutes of brand new demos

1472
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,759
that have happened within the last you

1473
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:54,719
know

1474
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,640
some odd like

1475
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,480
two to five years

1476
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,320

1479
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,280
just a couple seconds

1480
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,840
of each one to give you an idea

1481

1488
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,520

1520
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,640
you'll get 3d

1521
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:48,640
[Music]

1522
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,640
me

1523
01:13:55,170 --> 01:14:05,120
[Music]

1524
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,600
okay that's all folks

1525
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,840
now you know everything about the

1526
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,679
democrat alphabet

1527
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,560
try to repeat and mesmerize it

1528
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,679
and if you forget any letter just come

1529
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:22,640
back and start this demo again

1530
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,880
so a lot of people have tried to do what

1531
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,159
i'm doing

1532
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,880
some of them more successful than others

1533
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,000
um

1534
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,600
we're definitely not going to watch this

1535
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,480
whole thing here but

1536
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,760
this is one that takes a more

1537
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,199
tongue-in-cheek approach

1538
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:48,239
hcc abcde or abc hello kids my name is

1539
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,440
spider final the dog

1540
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,880
fine go final is my name

1541
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,880
f heidi hoho

1542
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,159
final repeat up to me kids okay enough

1543
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,760
of that so

1544
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,640
um

1545
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,880
what we've tried to explain is that

1546
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,719
there are these like not only there

1547
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,280
there are common demo categories

1548
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,640
and then

1549
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,480
there are all of these repeated effects

1550
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,440
that basically are memes in demos right

1551
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,480
uh so enough looking at charlie here

1552
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,320
um

1553
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,920
stuff that we already saw we saw some

1554
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,760
crack tros which is literally just an

1555
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,679
intro and a cracked game

1556
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,840
uh yeah we saw an intro which are these

1557
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,880
small demos we saw a mega demo sometimes

1558
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,400
called a dentro

1559
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,800
um you know or a demo

1560
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,199
somewhere in between these

1561
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,800
people don't really use the term dentro

1562
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,560
anymore

1563
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,000
these are the kinds of things that we've

1564
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,679
seen already

1565
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:44,480
but

1566
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,960
there are categories so

1567
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,600
there are 64k demos

1568
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,320
that are literally demos that are 64

1569
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,719
kilobytes in size and do some pretty

1570
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,960
amazing like

1571
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,120
just to give you an example of what you

1572
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,559
can do with 64k

1573
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,840
this is an old 64k demo

1574
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,000
[Music]

1575
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,679
and i skip right to the part where it's

1576
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,070
calculating

1577
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:28,239
[Music]

1578
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:31,679
so that is old and to give you a kind of

1579
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,239
middle of the road here's 2014 mercury

1580
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,880
does this really cool

1581
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,280
water effect that really drew me in

1582
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,040
but then there's so much more to this

1583
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,650
demo than just that

1584
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:51,409
[Music]

1585
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,480
this entire thing the music

1586
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,199
the video everything is 64k

1587
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,150
it's just nuts

1588
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:05,360
[Music]

1589
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,520
they do this we're gonna skip through it

1590
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,880
a little bit i'm sorry to mercury

1591
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,080
oops and i skipped right ahead to

1592
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,239
another slide too

1593
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:23,199
that is not what i wanted to do here

1594
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,120
well you saw some of that this the scene

1595
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,679
at the end is also pretty unreal

1596
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,280
uh looks like

1597
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,040
pretty much a real city scene

1598
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,920
[Music]

1599
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,840
someone probably saw that

1600
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,930
just trying to get here

1601
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:46,480
[Music]

1602
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,480
it's pretty incredible uh there's

1603
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,640
another basically mercury

1604
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,480
and conspiracy the other guys that are

1605
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,120
doing 60 4ks are competing against each

1606
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:55,920
other

1607
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,880
conspiracy has been on a kick

1608
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,800
um and i i don't know there's they're

1609
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,120
sort of exiting the kick but as soon as

1610
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,800
i say that i'm gonna see another one

1611
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,080
where they've been trying to do these

1612
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,320
like sort of photo realistic

1613
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,400
movie trailer things

1614
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,520
in 64k hello come on

1615
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,840
stay on the slide

1616
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,919
[Music]

1617
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,360
and we'll jump

1618
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,839
forward

1619
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,600
conspiracy stuff is typically very

1620
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,400
atmospheric

1621
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,480
and you actually see something similar

1622
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,800
to what we just saw but

1623
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,320
maybe a little bit leveled up this is

1624
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,960
much newer

1625
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,080
wait much newer

1626
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,480
somewhat newer

1627
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,199
[Music]

1628
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,040
jump ahead a little bit more

1629
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,370
jump head a little bit more

1630
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,470
[Music]

1631
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,480
just give me an idea of you know like

1632
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,660
very moody

1633
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,739
[Music]

1634
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,560
entire thing 64k

1635
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,480
but we can do better than that how about

1636
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,959
4k

1637
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,480
one of my videos has been nuked

1638
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,520
so these guys

1639
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,440
did something i mean we're talking about

1640
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,090
4k here we can't do a whole lot

1641
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:44,000
[Music]

1642
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,760
we decided to kind of get a little bit

1643
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,760
uh existential go into space here's some

1644
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,840
more my cube is better than your cube

1645
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,120
does some more interesting stuff

1646
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,559
eventually the cube travels

1647
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,480
we build a building from scratch

1648
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,360
and fly around in the building

1649
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,199
this is from a time where ribbon

1650
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,940
animation was also quite big

1651
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:21,120
[Music]

1652
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,840
and then eventually at the end we see a

1653
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,840
return

1654
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,530
[Music]

1655
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:31,630
[Applause]

1656
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,360
oh hey what's that it's the return of

1657
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,530
the cube

1658
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:41,120
[Music]

1659
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,880
i like that one a lot this was from

1660
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,280
evoke 2017.

1661
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:53,760
and i'm just gonna say this over and

1662
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,679
over like a broken record the audio

1663
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,400
included in this visual experience that

1664
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,560
you're getting is still

1665
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,190
4k for the whole thing

1666
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:06,240
[Music]

1667
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,080
getting like a

1668
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,320
half blade runner

1669
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,120
experience here

1670
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:22,000
[Music]

1671
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,560
it's pretty serious okay oh and i uh i

1672
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,239
should

1673
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,719
we should show you oscar's chair so a

1674
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:29,920
lot of these

1675
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,000
are very algorithmic right because when

1676
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,920
you're getting down to 4k everything has

1677
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,400
to be written drawn by you know a math

1678
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,159
equation basically

1679
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,239
uh but these guys went in a completely

1680
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,559
different direction

1681
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,520
and decided to draw a very realistic

1682
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,640
room in a chair

1683
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,600
[Laughter]

1684
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,280
and you don't really know what the story

1685
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,199
of oscar's chair is but we do know that

1686
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,000
there's a problem

1687
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,880
there seems to be a pool of liquid on

1688
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,280
the floor

1689
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,560
near the chair

1690
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,320
some guy named oscar

1691
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,440
maybe there was an accident

1692
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,600
it's pretty clear what kind of an

1693
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,400
accident it might have been

1694
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:28,239
but of course in the end the chair went

1695
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,080
this was pretty game-changing for 4ks

1696
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,120
and caused a lot of people to have to

1697
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,480
up the quality of their demos

1698
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,360
so

1699
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,800
recently

1700
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,480
there is a huge

1701
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,480
movement into going even smaller

1702
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:02,080
256 bytes or 128 bytes or

1703
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,239
64 bytes

1704
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:09,360
so what can you do with 64 bytes

1705
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,440
well i guess the audio is out of the

1706
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,839
question

1707
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,400
but you can still do some stuff

1708
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,320
and you saw that 256 bite at the

1709
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,000
beginning

1710
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
but

1711
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,679
text message

1712
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,639
works of uh

1713
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,480
machine language and you do stuff like

1714
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,638
this

1715
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,159
uh by the way i did a i committed a sin

1716
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,679
and checked my phone in the middle of my

1717
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,239
panel and i saw a notice that someone

1718
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,000
says the youtube live stream might be

1719
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,440
down

1720
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,679
so i'm shouting that out to the back

1721
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,000
just in case

1722
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,960
so size coding is becoming an incredibly

1723
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,239
big deal

1724
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:09,520
but

1725
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,040
if you couldn't figure it out already

1726
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,719
demos or memes we've already shouted

1727
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,320
this out

1728
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,000
you can see all sorts of examples of

1729
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,880
this

1730
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,040
uh you have definitely already seen some

1731
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,800
scroll text

1732
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,760
um

1733
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,560
and

1734
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,840
there's even

1735
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,080
someone that did a parody and called it

1736
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,080
elder scrollers

1737
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,760
and said you know what we're just gonna

1738
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,679
one-up this and everything in the demo

1739
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,360
is gonna be a scroller

1740
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,520
so there's all of this like

1741
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,239
scroll text in this demo

1742
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,990
of course i had to skip to the like

1743
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:45,840
[Music]

1744
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,520
one of their scrollers is just like

1745
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,920
the scroller game keeps on getting more

1746
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,320
and more serious

1747
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,199
[Music]

1748
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,120
whenever the screen is blank

1749
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,560
you know that they're calculating

1750
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,270
something

1751
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:06,400
[Music]

1752
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,360
3d amiga boing ball on a commodore 64

1753
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,990
for example

1754
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:25,459
[Music]

1755
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,679
sorry i know we're watching like just

1756
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,320
little tiny pieces of these but uh they

1757
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,760
they are available and i want to get to

1758
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,040
the new stuff

1759
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,600
uh pixel and scene art

1760
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,480
huge big deal

1761
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,600
noon

1762
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,000
stars

1763
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,840
this this was a really cool demo with a

1764
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,400
lot of artistic stuff in it i highly

1765
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,679
suggest that

1766
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:52,639
you saw this guy in the middle but

1767
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,480
shout outs definitely appear in scroll

1768
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,440
texts all the time they call them greets

1769
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:01,678
and you know dots because pixel art

1770
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,080
plasma

1771
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,080
3d on computers that have no business

1772
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,360
doing 3d

1773
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,120
tunnels

1774
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,040
you definitely saw a couple of those but

1775
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,880
just in case it wasn't

1776
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,560
perfectly clear what you can do with

1777
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,760
tunnels

1778
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,440
oops well

1779
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,440
we didn't get to the tunnel part

1780
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,639
sorry

1781
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,670
let's try that again

1782
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:29,199
[Music]

1783
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:33,320
great example here

1784
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:42,000
[Music]

1785
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,320
this guy is making that face because he

1786
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,890
can't compete with this tunnel

1787
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:49,520
[Music]

1788
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,040
all sorts of ray tracing and ray

1789
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,519
marching

1790
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,199
you get scene references like references

1791
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,520
to the party that people are at

1792
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,480
uh this demo in the middle is debris

1793
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,080
and i think we might have actually

1794
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,159
watched debris at a previous uh

1795
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,840
event but i want to show you the live

1796
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,360
version of debris

1797
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,600
uh in a second here actually

1798
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
why don't we make it a literal second

1799
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,360
i'm going to show you

1800
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,239
debris shown live

1801
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,920
because really to get an idea of what

1802
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,679
these festivals are like i mean

1803
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:26,880
certainly

1804
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,560
y'all are like sitting here clapping

1805
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,639
when you see a cool demo and oohing and

1806
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,400
eyeing and wowing and right

1807
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,560
but picture yourself in a room with a

1808
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,159
bunch of people that actually write

1809
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,080
these it's going to take a little bit

1810
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,480
more to impress them

1811
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,440
than it is probably all of us right

1812
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,040
um so

1813
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,199
what how how exactly

1814
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,000
you know does that work how how much

1815
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,040
does it take to impress them

1816
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,000
so

1817
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,239
here is a live capture

1818
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,960
of breakpoint 2007 where they actually

1819
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,520
showed debris

1820
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,520
and uh yeah we'll just watch this

1821
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,880
now you can feel like you're really

1822
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,199
there

1823
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,280
they have the system here that shows you

1824
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,560
you know the name of the next demo

1825
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,239
that's about to play the one that played

1826
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,638
last

1827
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:24,560
[Applause]

1828
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,320
everyone in the audience is probably

1829
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,320
drunk

1830
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,360
i'm sure you've never seen one of these

1831
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,719
before it's called a progress bar

1832
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,320
but actually what's happening is they're

1833
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,120
doing all sorts of pre-pre-calculation

1834
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,719
de-crunching because we're watching a

1835
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,639
64k demo

1836
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,880
so it's actually unpacking you know two

1837
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,040
gigs worth of crap into ram

1838
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:55,320
from the 64k thing

1839
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:12,939
[Music]

1840
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,199
[Music]

1841
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,120
and what you probably don't know because

1842
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,639
you didn't you weren't there or maybe

1843
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,239
someone here was but

1844
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:29,679
uh

1845
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:32,719
this is a reference to the neighborhood

1846
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:35,360
that they went to to go to break point

1847
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,480
so

1848
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,040
someone has built you know it's like

1849
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,719
going to hope and someone built a demo

1850
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,199
with st john's in it you know or the

1851
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:46,599
hotel pen

1852
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:02,490
[Music]

1853
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,560
this is the ultimate my cube is better

1854
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,840

[Applause]

1885
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,960
sorry far brush i'm cutting off your

1886
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,119
applause but

1887
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,560
that gives you an idea of what it's like

1888
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,040
to be there

1889
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,840
there's a lot of fourth wall breaking

1890
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,760
party references

1891
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,080
uh there are hardware references

1892
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:02,159
any amiga users remember intel outside

1893
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,480
uh you also got

1894
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,560
these guys referencing

1895
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,280
you know their own hardware

1896
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,360
so uh here's a super nintendo or the

1897
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,719
beginning of super nintendo where

1898
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,080
they're literally just

1899
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,000
showing you hey

1900
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,320
i wrote the step on a super nintendo

1901
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,639
here it is

1902
01:37:33,330 --> 01:38:05,800
[Music]

1903
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,920
[Music]

1904
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,960
so

1905
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,480
you get all these people referencing

1906
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,320
their platform and just showing off what

1907
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,600
they can do

1908
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,840
and i think maybe now is actually as

1909
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,400
good a time as any to show off

1910
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,320
one thing that i think i've kind of

1911
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,199
ignored in past

1912
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:26,880
presentations i showed a little bit of

1913
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,000
this

1914
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,800
in my 2018 talk where i showed some game

1915
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,960
consoles doing demos

1916
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,440
uh but normally the demo scene at least

1917
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,960
back in the day

1918
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,800
would be you know something you download

1919
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,480
something you run on your pc or media

1920
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,080
your commodore whatever

1921
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,320
uh but people have been getting more and

1922
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,080
more exotic

1923
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,880
as time has gone on so

1924
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,920
now people are trying to write

1925
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,920
demos for some of the weirdest consoles

1926
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,760
they can

1927
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,960
just as an example i have here a 3do

1928
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,119
demo which by the way

1929
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:04,960
does anyone remember the 3do

1930
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:07,119
does anyone that remembers the 3do know

1931
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,920
what cpu it

1932
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,159
had nope

1933
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,239
this is going to be wild and this is

1934
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:17,600
going to blow your mind and i learned

1935
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,119
this recently or kind of recently anyway

1936
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:23,280
it's arm

1937
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,480
it's the first arm device we really saw

1938
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,480
in the us

1939
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,639
um so anyway i i thought that was

1940
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,239
interesting and

1941
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,320
maybe now that puts into perspective the

1942
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,080
3do totally got knocked out by the

1943
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,159
playstation right

1944
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,920
but it was i mean

1945
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,520
the biggest reason was probably no one

1946
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,800
wanted to spend 700 on a game console

1947
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,080
um but

1948
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,400
people also saw that it was an arm at 12

1949
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,880
megahertz and not you know like a mips

1950
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,960
at 28 or something like that and they

1951
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,440
were like oh well there's no way that 12

1952
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,600
megahertz cpu can outrun that 28

1953
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,639
megahertz cpu

1954
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:02,480
looking back i think the arm probably

1955
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,440
could have outrun that 28 megahertz cpu

1956
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,760
but anyway that's not the point um i

1957
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,000
just wanted to show you a and these guys

1958
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,400
actually use the name dentro because

1959
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,719
they call it a three dentro instead of a

1960
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,360
3do

1961
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,760
so

1962
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,879
isn't it cute

1963
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:48,680
[Music]

1964
01:40:53,200 --> 01:41:24,369
[Music]

1965
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,400
music by

1966
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,190
pam

1967
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:37,199
[Music]

1968
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,199
so

1969
01:41:45,690 --> 01:41:54,370
[Music]

1970
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,520
it's a little bit new right

1971
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,360
we haven't seen any demos that reference

1972
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,350
discord yet

1973
01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:14,719
[Music]

1974
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:18,670
and real 3do memes

1975
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:53,679
[Music]

1976
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:56,320
so pretty cool there's now a 3do scene

1977
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,880
and we have to go write some demos

1978
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,639
so if anyone knows how to write code for

1979
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:01,440
arm

1980
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,320
which

1981
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,800
hey might be a whole lot of people now

1982
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:09,320
you can write 3do software too

1983
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,040
so that's not the only console maybe we

1984
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:21,560
could uh we could run a couple more

1985
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:25,520
[Music]

1986
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,840
not this one though

1987
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:31,040
why don't we move on to

1988
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,280
oh hey

1989
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,280
anyone ever heard of a gamecube

1990
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,199
it's kind of like a mac but smaller

1991
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,320
you laugh but it's actually a g4 with an

1992
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,010
ati radio

1993

[Music]

1994
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:59,000

[Music]

1996
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:27,270
so

1997
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:38,119
[Music]

1998
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,020

[Music]

2000
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,880
i hope you like breaks

2001
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,800
there are many brains and demos

2002
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:29,410
[Music]

2003
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,800
so

2004
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,140
hmm

2005
01:45:53,140 --> 01:46:23,080
[Music]

2006
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:31,719
it's one scary-ass game of pac-man

2007
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,520
so

2008
01:46:46,570 --> 01:47:00,960
[Music]

2009
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,159
but who competed with the gamecube

2010
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:26,719
[Music]

2011
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:28,560
they seem to have found those spinning

2012
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,320
cubes from debris or maybe that's where

2013
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,430
they got them from

2014
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:42,840

01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:43,040
[Music]

2027
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,040
so

2028
01:50:48,990 --> 01:51:36,210
[Music]

2029
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:38,719
[Applause]

2030
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:39,810
so i keep running

2031
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:42,889
[Applause]

2032
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,360
so at this point you're probably saying

2033
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:48,480
oh gamecube playstation 2.

2034
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,599
i mean like

2035
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:51,040
that's pretty cool

2036
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,880
and it's not a playstation 2 or a

2037
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,800
gamecube or whatever but maybe you could

2038
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,880
impress me a little bit more

2039
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,960
uh you know i i do think that that's

2040
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,920
pretty impressive for the hardware but

2041
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,599
you talked about all these old computers

2042
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:04,960
being able to do

2043
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,360
some crazy wacky so

2044
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,040
uh we're gonna we're gonna take a step

2045
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,400
back from

2046
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,960
what i like to consider non-retro

2047
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,159
consoles

2048
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:16,000
uh i still don't think a gamecube is

2049
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,199
retro

2050
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:19,280
uh i still get slightly offended when a

2051
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,840
kid comes in and says oh mario 64 is so

2052
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,119
retro

2053
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:24,000
um

2054
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,480
but uh we're gonna go past the nintendo

2055
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:27,760
64.

2056
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,280
blow right past it and uh

2057
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,119
how about we uh switch to some super

2058
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:36,180
nintendo stuff

2059
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:54,210
[Music]

2060
01:52:58,030 --> 01:53:25,599
[Music]

2061
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:27,119
for those of you that don't know the

2062
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:31,040
super nintendo is three megahertz

2063
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,280
it has its own sound mixing cpu which is

2064
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:34,800
the only reason it's

2065
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,840
even worth a damn at audio

2066
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:47,840
[Music]

2067
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,080
side note pandas are pretty cute

2068
01:53:51,080 --> 01:54:06,080
[Music]

2069
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,560
this is real time and no super effects

2070
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,000
because they've destroyed one with a

2071
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
mushroom

2072
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:25,660
[Music]

2073
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:28,330
so

2074
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:43,520
[Music]

2075
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,080
feet

2076
01:54:45,080 --> 01:55:17,970
[Music]

2077
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:25,400
we're still in the same demo

2078
01:55:25,540 --> 01:56:01,440
[Music]

2079
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,840
ah the greeted bit shifters

2080
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,510
i've done stuff with them

2081
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:58,239
[Music]

2082
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,480
and then we get a repeat

2083
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:05,559
[Music]

2084
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:10,300
anyone ever heard of a vectrex

2085
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:12,800
[Music]

2086
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,639
apparently there's a demo scene for that

2087
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:15,330
too

2088
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:18,239
[Music]

2089
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,080
the carnegie mellon computer club has

2090
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:23,040
taken it upon themselves to

2091
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:27,440
write multiple vectrex demos

2092
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,000
there's a special kind of demo called an

2093
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,880
invitro that actually invites you to

2094
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,390
their demo party

2095
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:56,960
[Music]

2096
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,960
so

2097
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:07,099
[Music]

2098
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:25,599
i'm glad some of you got that joke

2099
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:27,199
for those of you that didn't there are

2100
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:31,320
no pixels on this machine

2101
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
so

2102
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:48,269
[Music]

2103
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,840
oh hey

2104
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:16,720
[Music]

2105
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:35,239
so

2106
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,790
so

2107
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:49,920
[Music]

2108
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,959
[Music]

2109
02:01:22,730 --> 02:01:25,599
[Music]

2110
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:28,599
so

2111
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:51,679
moving on how about

2112
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:56,360
one nintendo 64 demo

2113
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:07,469
[Music]

2114
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:18,420
[Music]

2115
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:24,728
[Music]

2116
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:37,840
[Music]

2117
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,920
i think someone accidentally a gamecube

2118
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:43,360
inside of their n64

2119
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:47,080
maybe not quite

2120
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,990
[Applause]

2121
02:02:49,990 --> 02:02:51,860
[Music]

2122
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:52,990
[Applause]

2123
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:57,180
[Music]

2124
02:02:57,180 --> 02:02:57,980
[Applause]

2125
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:03,579
[Music]

2126
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,480
so

2127
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:18,340
[Music]

2128
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:23,429
[Music]

2129
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:28,360
like

2130
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:29,840
[Music]

2131
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,350
is

2132
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:55,299
[Music]

2133
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,920
you

2134
02:03:58,650 --> 02:03:58,880
[Applause]

2135
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:04,040
[Music]

2136
02:04:08,290 --> 02:04:10,620
[Music]

2137
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,320
[Applause]

2138
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,280
[Music]

2139
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,850
so

2140
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:17,240
[Applause]

2141
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:37,688
[Music]

2142
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:46,960
but wait

2143
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,960
there's competition in the vetrex

2144
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,119
category you wouldn't know that more

2145
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:55,400
people are writing vectrex demos

2146
02:04:57,090 --> 02:05:13,199
[Music]

2147
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:16,199
do

2148
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:27,009
[Music]

2149
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,150
do

2150
02:05:30,150 --> 02:05:40,559
[Music]

2151
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:43,060
do

2152
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:57,970
[Music]

2153
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:04,420
does your vectrex have a physics engine

2154
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:31,450
[Music]

2155
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,040
i don't know if it's the camera man or

2156
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,800
not but some of these effects you can

2157
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,880
see the machine is clearly not happy

2158
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,040
with this

2159
02:06:48,440 --> 02:07:35,269
[Music]

2160
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:39,119
all right i get two more console demos

2161
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:41,119
and then i'm gonna crane through a few

2162
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:43,839
more slides

2163
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:46,590
here's an interesting one i found

2164
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:47,920
[Music]

2165
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:51,760
we're now in game boy color land

2166
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,130
a little bit of hacking is being done

2167
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:57,270
[Music]

2168
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:11,749
[Music]

2169
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,030
do

2170
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:25,599
[Music]

2171
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:28,079
the game boy and the game boy color are

2172
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:32,960
as fast as your ti graphing calculator

2173
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,239
same cpu

2174
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:49,749
[Music]

2175
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:57,179
[Music]

2176
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:04,590
[Music]

2177
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:11,079
don't worry i can't read it either

2178
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:22,930
[Music]

2179
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:45,199
[Music]

2180
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:20,159
[Music]

2181
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:23,159
so

2182
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:47,560
[Music]

2183
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,100
do

2184
02:10:50,100 --> 02:11:19,119
[Music]

2185
02:11:19,119 --> 02:11:20,800
i'm going to jump ahead just a little

2186
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:24,000
bit to atari 2600 lan because i want you

2187
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,520
to see that too before i have to go

2188
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:27,310
through slides

2189
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:30,359
[Music]

2190
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,440
this is dissonant as because the

2191
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:38,119
atari only has 32 notes

2192
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:40,960
but they're doing some pretty crazy

2193
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,440
stuff on the screen

2194
02:11:45,890 --> 02:11:53,810
[Music]

2195
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:59,209
[Music]

2196
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:09,920
[Music]

2197
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:12,000
who in here knows how much ram the atari

2198
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,040
2600 has

2199
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:16,560
there it is

2200
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:18,480
everyone hear that

2201
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:21,760
128 bytes of ram

2202
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:25,040
does it have a frame buffer

2203
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:27,920
it's a wonder that they even made games

2204
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:31,239
on this thing

2205
02:12:31,410 --> 02:12:35,830
[Music]

2206
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:38,480
all right we're going to quit this i'm

2207
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:40,239
going to jump through a few more slides

2208
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:42,560
because i really want to tell you

2209
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,320
a few other things that are going on in

2210
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:45,840
the scene that i think are kind of big

2211
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,520
right

2212
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:48,800
um

2213
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,560
here's just a couple more like memes

2214
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,800
that i'm just gonna skip past like

2215
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,400
there there are a bunch of dancing and

2216
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,400
mocap demos

2217
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,960
uh there are demos that cover

2218
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,040
other demos so

2219
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:04,000
uh previously we we showed this in a

2220
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,320
previous version of the panel

2221
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:10,000
and you get to watch this you know like

2222
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,599
pretty cool mocap demo and there's some

2223
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:19,040
dancing in it

2224
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:20,880
it actually starts to look more like

2225
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,040
dancing here

2226
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:24,159
but then

2227
02:13:24,159 --> 02:13:26,239
someone

2228
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:29,040
went and did an atari 2600 version of

2229
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:31,520
this

2230
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:35,360
and you think i'm joking but like

2231
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:40,480
and they even have the dancing person

2232
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:43,480
like

2233
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:50,560
where are you dancing person

2234
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:52,920
there you go

2235
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,760
[Music]

2236
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,960
i can't believe that someone did this

2237
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:02,880
you also get sample playback

2238
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:05,599
on a commodore 64. they went crazy and

2239
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:07,630
did a whole bunch of like

2240
02:14:07,630 --> 02:14:10,869
[Music]

2241
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:13,840
you can listen to tom steiner look up

2242
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:16,079
cubase 64. you can even run it on your

2243
02:14:16,079 --> 02:14:18,400
real c64

2244
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,638
and

2245
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:25,639
i wanted the rest of that

2246
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:28,880
and you can do

2247
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,679
all of these effects

2248
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:52,480
anyway so that's fascinating

2249
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:55,480
and

2250
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:58,719
if you think that's great

2251
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:03,199
[Music]

2252
02:15:03,199 --> 02:15:05,120
just wait

2253
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:14,420
[Music]

2254
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,239
but wait

2255
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:22,360
this is a commodore 64.

2256
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:34,159
and they're actually playing

2257
02:15:34,159 --> 02:15:37,839
decent quality sample playback

2258
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:39,970
dynamic range is very good

2259
02:15:39,970 --> 02:15:43,079
[Music]

2260
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,119
and they have time for graphics on the

2261
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:46,639
screen while they're doing it which is

2262
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:47,520
just

2263
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,520
wild to think about for a system this

2264
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,470
slow

2265
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:59,040
[Music]

2266
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:00,719
and they don't just do these simple

2267
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:02,159
effects

2268
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:04,239
they actually do stuff that requires

2269
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:06,639
real cpu time to run

2270
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:09,360
for example

2271
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:11,920
black screens

2272
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:13,780
oh wait

2273
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:18,560
[Music]

2274
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,360
fast scrolling over high-res images

2275
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:24,159
so just yet another example of some of

2276
02:16:24,159 --> 02:16:27,199
the crazy stuff they're doing

2277
02:16:27,199 --> 02:16:30,320
um this winter reality is second reality

2278
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:32,398
done by jason scott

2279
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:34,000
uh with

2280
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,879
a video camera and video editing

2281
02:16:36,879 --> 02:16:40,000
uh i love the

2282
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,240
fourth wall breaking in the dc5 demos

2283
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:47,840
uh just a quick look at that

2284
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:49,599
oops

2285
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:53,129
so quick that we skip to the next slide

2286
02:16:53,129 --> 02:17:05,760
[Music]

2287
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:09,080
and eventually

2288
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:15,200
[Music]

2289
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,040
well anyway we're gonna skip past this

2290
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,879
because

2291
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:20,959
uh you end up with terrain generators

2292
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:23,920
i'm sure you've seen this

2293
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:25,760
but what's great about this is someone

2294
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,840
decided oh i'm gonna generate mountains

2295
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,318
but now

2296
02:17:30,398 --> 02:17:31,709
i'm gonna ski through them

2297
02:17:31,709 --> 02:17:37,780
[Music]

2298
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:43,200
so that ends up being pretty cool you

2299
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:44,638
also end up with these twisters you've

2300
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:46,240
seen a couple of these in the demos that

2301
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,760
we've been watching

2302
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:49,120
so

2303
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:52,000
what's hot right now

2304
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,920
live coding competitions are hot right

2305
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,840
now and this is one thing that i have

2306
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:57,920
i've spent virtually no

2307
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:01,200
time on in previous panels and i think

2308
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,398
it's really

2309
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:04,318
important but also has just like in the

2310
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:06,799
last five years has just blown way the

2311
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:07,920
 up

2312
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:09,760
um on the right we have a shader

2313
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:11,519
showdown where people are writing gl

2314
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:13,599
shader language live and they have 30

2315
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:14,558
minutes

2316
02:18:14,558 --> 02:18:16,638
to write the coolest shader in real time

2317
02:18:16,638 --> 02:18:18,160
that they can

2318
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,318
and it's one person against the other

2319
02:18:20,318 --> 02:18:21,280
and

2320
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,200
you know some of some of these guys you

2321
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:25,840
know like practice shaders and like have

2322
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,599
an idea of a shader they're going to

2323
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,760
write some people do it completely off

2324
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:32,080
the cuff there are upsets there's all

2325
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:34,718
sorts of amazing stuff going on

2326
02:18:34,718 --> 02:18:37,040
but there's another thing that i mean i

2327
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:38,799
think a lot of people

2328
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:40,558
that know about shade or know about the

2329
02:18:40,558 --> 02:18:42,638
demo scene might know about shader

2330
02:18:42,638 --> 02:18:43,840
showdowns

2331
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:46,959
uh there are also bike battles

2332
02:18:46,959 --> 02:18:50,080
uh this is something that love bite uh a

2333
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:52,959
demo party is doing uh love bite has a

2334
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:55,120
whole lot of it's basically a size

2335
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,558
coding

2336
02:18:56,558 --> 02:18:58,318
demo party

2337
02:18:58,318 --> 02:18:59,519
and

2338
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:01,519
they ha their bite battle is uh does

2339
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:04,960
anyone know what the tick 80 is

2340
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:07,359
so uh there are these fantasy game

2341
02:19:07,359 --> 02:19:08,638
consoles

2342
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:10,799
uh you have a virtual machine

2343
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:12,879
for a game console that doesn't actually

2344
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:14,240
exist

2345
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:17,200
uh and it has kind of in theoretical

2346
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:20,398
limitations and that sort of a thing

2347
02:19:20,398 --> 02:19:22,318
and so they write

2348
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:25,120
size coded stuff in real time against

2349
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:26,959
each other just like the shader showdown

2350
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:29,519
but instead of the goal being to come up

2351
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:31,840
with as cool as shader that you can

2352
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:34,000
the goal is to come up with the coolest

2353
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:34,799
like

2354
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:37,120
pixel art animation sort of thing that

2355
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,478
you can

2356
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:41,200
so i actually have

2357
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,359
uh they they released a little

2358
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:45,679
uh sort of pseudo demo

2359
02:19:45,679 --> 02:19:48,558
from these guys

2360
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:51,280
that showcases some of the effects

2361
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:52,960
to give you an idea

2362
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:55,439
of what you can do with a tech80 i'll

2363
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:57,920
i'll do that afterwards but uh

2364
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,670
i want to show you

2365
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:01,280
[Music]

2366
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:03,120
actually there's a there's also a

a new concept where people from all

different kinds of platforms and

2374
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:27,920
backgrounds can come together and show

off their skills

2376
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,359
from amiga to atari or traditional so

2377
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:35,040
you sit here and you write live code and

2378
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,720
then you render it

2379
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:38,620

while you're at the party you can

comes up with the coolest effect

like a limbo dance the size limit will

2386

slowly count down from 512 bytes all the

way down to 256 bytes

system can actually do

2401
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:29,439
uh even though it's not a real system

2402
02:22:30,319 --> 02:22:33,680
i thought that i would produce one

2403
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:37,120
example of

2404
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:40,479
a size coated entry

2405
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:50,200

even hearing chord progressions at all

pretty cool

02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:16,479
another really big thing that i think

2426
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:18,640
needs some attention

2427
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:21,600
in this scene is there is a huge

2428
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:23,680
executable graphics thing happening

2429
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:24,960
right now

2430
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:27,280
uh this this is technically always been

2431
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:29,040
a thing and like isn't

2432
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:30,560
the point of the demo to be like

2433
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:32,399
algorithmic in the first place right but

2434
02:27:32,399 --> 02:27:33,359
like

2435
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:36,240
there are bots on twitter that are tied

2436
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:39,200
to emulators of specific platforms and

2437
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:43,439
you can literally tweet code at the bot

2438
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:45,600
and it'll draw stuff and tweet it back

2439
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,120
at you

2440
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:49,600
um so this is like an interesting cool

2441
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:51,280
way to kind of

2442
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:54,640
randomly become involved in the scene

2443
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:56,880
and not even have to go to a party you

2444
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:58,240
know i mean not that you wouldn't want

2445
02:27:58,240 --> 02:27:59,760
to go to one of these i think you should

2446
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:00,960
but

2447
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:03,439
you can do stuff and this this art might

2448
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:06,399
remind you of something

2449
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:10,160
does anyone see it and

2450
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:13,840
see something else they've seen recently

2451
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,479
so

2452
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:20,560
someone did a

2453
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:23,439
cover version

2454
02:28:23,439 --> 02:28:27,359
of the james webb telescope images

2455
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:31,680
in one tweet for each one of these

2456
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:33,760
and they just tweeted it at the bot

2457
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:35,760
and it comes back with this and i know

2458
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:38,080
this guy his name's paul

2459
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:41,280
and uh he's crazy because like

2460
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:44,240
i i just i can't believe and he

2461
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:47,040
regularly churns stuff out like this

2462
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:49,280
um and it's completely nuts um he

2463
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:53,880
doesn't just do retro stuff though

2464
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:56,479
he does

2465
02:28:56,479 --> 02:28:58,319
realistic looking

2466
02:28:58,319 --> 02:29:01,120
this is a four kilobyte executable that

2467
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:03,840
renders this

2468
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,080
and uh i was showing you scenes that you

2469
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:10,240
might have seen in new york recently

2470
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:11,060

[Music]

2472
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:14,160
this this kind of looks like something

2473
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:16,399
you might be able to travel not too far

2474
02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:17,120
and

2475
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:19,280
see scenery that looks like this

2476
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:23,399
this is also not a photo

2477
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,439
and uh

2478
02:29:27,439 --> 02:29:29,439
just just to suspend and and this is

2479
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:32,560
again this is 4k

2480
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:35,120
i have the exe file right here i could i

2481
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:37,840
could like run it and wait a minute for

2482
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:39,760
it to render it but like

2483
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:42,080
um but but if you really

2484
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:44,560
want to blow your own mind

2485
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:48,359
or something like that

2486
02:29:50,319 --> 02:29:53,040
this is not a photo

2487
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:54,399
he's got like

2488
02:29:54,399 --> 02:29:57,200
imperfections in the floppy disk

2489
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:59,439
um you can tell it's not real because he

2490
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:01,359
sent this to a demo party called outline

2491
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:03,760
and he wrote it like on the usb stick

2492
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:05,359
like

2493
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:08,160
and uh and and here's a fun easter egg

2494
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:11,200
you see the the line printer print out

2495
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,800
this is actually

2496
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:15,439
the shader code that renders this

2497
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:18,439
inside

2498
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:20,160
and he blurred it out and made it look

2499
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,479
like a printout it's just completely

2500
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:24,880
 crazy so

2501
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:26,640
this dude has some competition because

2502
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:28,560
this is an actual category that you can

2503
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,760
compete in

2504
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:32,479
in a demo party so this this right here

2505
02:30:32,479 --> 02:30:34,880
i mean like this is beautiful right

2506
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:38,080
this got third place

2507
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:40,160
that means there are two

2508
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:42,080
of these that people thought would were

2509
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:44,080
better than this

2510
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:46,399
and those are

2511
02:30:46,399 --> 02:30:48,880
this one

2512
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:56,479
this one is by yx

2513
02:30:56,479 --> 02:30:59,760
is this your card i believe

2514
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:02,399
uh the next one is pbr and i totally am

2515
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:04,160
forget i'm just spacing out on the name

2516
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:06,319
of this demo or you know executable

2517
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:07,840
graphics this one's

2518
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:11,600
a little bit more fantasy than photo

2519
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:14,560
but it kind of

2520
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:16,720
suspension of disbelief here in the real

2521
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:18,160
world

2522
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:19,120
just

2523
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:21,840
amazing artwork in

2524
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:24,080
four

2525
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:30,479
kilobytes just nuts

2526
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:35,040
so that is the end of the slides that i

2527
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,760
have uh i have a couple other demos in

2528
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:38,800
here

2529
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:41,040
um i wanted to see how much time i would

2530
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:42,560
have at the end of the presentation i

2531
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:43,680
think i have like

2532
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:45,280
five ten minutes at most there is

2533
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:49,280
something going on in here at one right

2534
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:53,119
i'm getting shrugs

2535
02:31:54,399 --> 02:31:56,479
um here's what we're gonna do i'm gonna

2536
02:31:56,479 --> 02:31:58,800
run demos until someone kicks me off of

2537
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,880
the stage which is actually how this

2538
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:02,560
worked in 2018.

2539
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,680
um

2540
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,520
i want to show you some cool hacker

2541
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:06,960
relevant stuff

2542
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:09,600
uh one that i think that you'll really

2543
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:10,880
like

2544
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:14,160
is this one

2545
02:32:14,479 --> 02:32:18,800
do we still have amiga fans in the house

2546
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,520
i lost all my amiga i have a half of an

2547
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:22,960
amiga fan

2548
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:25,520
i have a constipated amiga fan

2549
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:26,399
uh

2550
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:27,520
all right

2551
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:31,439
so this is a 64 kilobyte

2552
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:33,359
they call it an intro just because it's

2553
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:34,640
small

2554
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:38,160
but this is something on the amiga

2555
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,000
64k

2556
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,680
and i think this will resonate with some

2557
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:44,680
people

2558
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:02,519
takes time to load okay

2559
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:09,680
everyone has their favorite fake hacker

2560
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:10,960
os

2561
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:15,080
i think this one might be mine

2562
02:33:22,319 --> 02:33:25,319
uh

hey man uh i found another interesting

2567
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,439
signal but it totally crashed my machine

2568
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:15,200
i have no idea what's going on uh can

2569
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:18,920
you see if we can find it

2570
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:35,960
one

2571
02:34:41,410 --> 02:34:44,979

[Music]

2575
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:10,880
y'all notice what time the demo started

2576
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:13,839
at right

2577
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:18,840

02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:45,160
oh

2580
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:06,840
this is his greets focus design black

2581
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:09,760
lotus loonies

2582
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:11,200
these are all the groups that he's

2583
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:12,800
shouting out

2584
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:15,730
secretly

[Music]

2588
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:26,880
it's pretty cool for 64k i think

2589
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,680
another very weird

2590
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:33,600
so there's a category called wild where

2591
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,439
you just enter anything that you can

2592
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:38,080
enter because it doesn't necessarily fit

2593
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:40,240
a mold

2594
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:44,319
and i was really fascinated by this one

2595
02:37:44,319 --> 02:37:46,880
which is called lotto and that's by a

2596
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,720
group called nupo

2597
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:51,920
uh this guy had a previous demo of this

2598
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:54,560
where he built a handheld lidar

2599
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,080
that you could just kind of walk around

2600
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,479
things and he like

2601
02:37:58,479 --> 02:38:00,560
don't ask me why i have no idea he has a

2602
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:03,040
random ass toilet in his front yard

2603
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:05,120
and walks around it with his handheld

2604
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:07,680
lidar and 3d scans it

2605
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:10,319
and then can do stuff with it

2606
02:38:10,319 --> 02:38:12,240
uh he decided that he would level this

2607
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,600
up a little bit

2608
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:14,479
and

2609
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:18,800
he builds a like lidar into a wagon cart

2610
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:22,319
and drives it around this like barn and

2611
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:23,920
into the barn

2612
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:25,680
and then takes all the uh the point

2613
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:28,960
field data and makes a demo with it

2614
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:30,160
and so

2615
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:33,280
this is that

2616
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:39,439
and actually we can see

2617
02:38:39,439 --> 02:38:42,479
exactly how big this demo is

2618
02:38:42,479 --> 02:38:44,720
so it's not small

2619
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:46,160
he's got a lot of data that he has to

2620
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:48,080
get in there

2621
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:50,319
but

2622
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:54,000
when you see what he did

2623
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:55,280
i think

2624
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:56,880
i think you'll find it much more

2625
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:59,358
interesting

2626
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:01,280
and there's you know like there's an

2627
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:03,760
artistic and music aspect and

2628
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:07,240
surreal aspect

2629
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:20,200
up

2630
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:34,640
and this is just written in a game

2631
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:36,720
engine so like it's it goes to show that

2632
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:38,640
not everyone that writes a demo knows

2633
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,240
assembler

2634
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:41,600
or whatever and they can still do

2635
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,600
something that's kind of cool with all

2636
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:46,640
the data that they have

2637
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:49,040
so if you think you know oh i don't

2638
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:50,319
write you know assembler for the

2639
02:39:50,319 --> 02:39:52,080
commodore 64 or whatever i can't make a

2640
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,200
demo

2641
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:55,520
you can still do cool stuff and submit

2642
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:57,120
it to demo parties and

2643
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:00,600
people pick it up

2644
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:13,240
so

2706
02:50:49,280 --> 02:52:36,389
[Music]

2707
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:55,200
i can't even see how many people are

2708
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:58,960
still in here you all into this

2709
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:02,399
you want to watch another uh

2710
02:53:02,399 --> 02:53:03,279
live

2711
02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:05,040
demo

2712
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:06,240
have a little bit of feeling while

2713
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:08,560
you're there or let's do a little choose

2714
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:10,399
your own adventure you want to see

2715
02:53:10,399 --> 02:53:13,519
something really exotic

2716
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:16,560
choices

2717
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:19,439
live exotic

2718
02:53:19,439 --> 02:53:21,520
exotic all right

2719
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:23,120
so here we have

2720
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:25,760
a commodore 64 demo

2721
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,279
my name is matthias chris

2722
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:28,880
and that is happening on the wrong

2723
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:31,358
display

2724
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:37,279
some of you have seen this don't spoil

2725
02:53:37,279 --> 02:53:39,040
it you may also know me as quest of

2726
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:41,439
reflex and this is a standard c64

2727
02:53:41,439 --> 02:53:42,800
computer setup

2728
02:53:42,800 --> 02:53:46,800
monitor floppy drive also this is like

2729
02:53:46,800 --> 02:53:48,640
i'm now going to remove one of these

2730
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:50,640
components and then play a demo on what

2731
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,960
is left as you can see i've already

2732
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:54,800
loaded our program

2733
02:53:54,800 --> 02:53:56,240
and the program didn't do anything

2734
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:58,080
except install a driver on the floppy

2735
02:53:58,080 --> 02:54:00,800
drive we can now remove the c64 since we

2736
02:54:00,800 --> 02:54:02,880
don't need it anymore

2737
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:03,600
so

2738
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:06,479
so you're expecting him to load

2739
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:08,399
a demo and then disconnect the floppy

2740
02:54:08,399 --> 02:54:10,720
drive but

2741
02:54:10,720 --> 02:54:14,679
there goes the commodore 64.

2742
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:20,520
uh

2743
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:25,680
our floppy drive has two output lines

2744
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:28,240
data and clock we want clock directly

2745
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:30,000
connected to the video signal and we'll

2746
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,720
put a resistor before data this enables

2747
02:54:32,720 --> 02:54:34,880
us to generate three voltage levels one

2748
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:37,279
for black one for white and one for

2749
02:54:37,279 --> 02:54:38,800
triggering horizontal and vertical

2750
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:41,040
retraces you may have noticed that we're

2751
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:43,040
not connecting anything to the monitor's

2752
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:45,200
audio input since of course the floppy

2753
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:47,200
drive is perfectly capable of generating

2754
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:49,040
sound all by itself

2755
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,279
and now we just have to open and then

2756
02:54:51,279 --> 02:54:56,200
close the floppy drive to start the demo

2757
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:34,319
[Music]

2758
02:55:34,319 --> 02:55:37,319
so

2759
02:55:37,560 --> 02:55:41,910
[Music]

2760
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:52,200
okay

2761
02:55:58,399 --> 02:56:01,399
laughs

2762
02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:54,479
and you might be thinking okay i've seen

2763
02:56:54,479 --> 02:56:58,080
all i can see a floppy drive do

2764
02:56:58,080 --> 02:57:01,640
and you'd be wrong

2765
02:57:30,319 --> 02:57:33,319
hmm

2766
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:51,840
you

2767
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:32,200
poof

2768
02:58:35,359 --> 02:58:37,520
i've really just learned that people are

2769
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:39,600
completely nuts and can do anything they

2770
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:42,720
want to do really

2771
02:58:44,399 --> 02:58:46,800
so we'll switch over to the live one

2772
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:50,800
uh this is an unexpanded amiga 500 that

2773
02:58:50,800 --> 02:58:54,880
runs at eight megahertz or you know 7.16

2774
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:56,160
and

2775
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,880
uh this one also blew the audience away

2776
02:58:58,880 --> 02:59:01,359
so i think it's a pretty good one to

2777
02:59:01,359 --> 02:59:04,359
show

2778
02:59:05,550 --> 02:59:08,609
[Music]

2779
02:59:24,700 --> 02:59:27,200
[Applause]

2780
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:29,040
it's too bad our amiga fanboys aren't

2781
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:30,319
still here

2782
02:59:30,319 --> 02:59:31,680
they'd really know how to shout out

2783
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:34,760
their amiga now

2784
02:59:34,760 --> 02:59:46,240
[Music]

2785
02:59:46,240 --> 02:59:48,479
interesting quick note the black lotus

2786
02:59:48,479 --> 02:59:50,160
is known for doing

2787
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:53,920
high spec demos not low spec demos uh so

2788
02:59:53,920 --> 02:59:55,520
they do a lot of like

2789
02:59:55,520 --> 02:59:58,080
uh crazy 3d rendering and high spec

2790
02:59:58,080 --> 03:00:01,040
stuff on like 68060s which is the cpu

2791
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:02,319
that apple

2792
03:00:02,319 --> 03:00:05,680
really never used in high-end macs but

2793
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:07,439
it ended up in high-end amiga

2794
03:00:07,439 --> 03:00:09,200
accelerators that are

2795
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:11,520
 impossible to get at this point

2796
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:13,120
uh i've given up

2797
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:15,760
but uh so you start seeing this and

2798
03:00:15,760 --> 03:00:17,279
you're like oh this is gonna be

2799
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:19,760
interesting the black lotus wrote an old

2800
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:23,319

um

2834
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:03,120
we have some audience members who

2835
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:06,720
actually got to witness us live

2836
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,840
uh

2837
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:12,800
some other stuff i have

2838
03:06:12,800 --> 03:06:16,800
uh the last few things i have let's see

2839
03:06:16,800 --> 03:06:18,560
so i have

2840
03:06:18,560 --> 03:06:21,279
an atari 8-bit demo that is like 15

2841
03:06:21,279 --> 03:06:23,279
minutes long

2842
03:06:23,279 --> 03:06:25,680
um and has actually has a really cool

2843
03:06:25,680 --> 03:06:28,479
aesthetic and a bunch of cool stuff and

2844
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:30,880
uh i also from

2845
03:06:30,880 --> 03:06:33,520
uh you you noticed in the invitro the

2846
03:06:33,520 --> 03:06:35,279
there were two characters at the end of

2847
03:06:35,279 --> 03:06:37,359
it and one of them was ps

2848
03:06:37,359 --> 03:06:40,000
uh that's felipe he's a well-known guy

2849
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:41,840
that does something called demo scene

2850
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:43,920
theater 9000

2851
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:47,120
um and basically does kind of updates in

2852
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:48,960
the scene and whatever and i actually uh

2853
03:06:48,960 --> 03:06:50,319
looked to him

2854
03:06:50,319 --> 03:06:52,880
for a cool shader showdown that i could

2855
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:54,240
show

2856
03:06:54,240 --> 03:06:55,600
and he sent me a link of a shader

2857
03:06:55,600 --> 03:06:57,200
showdown so

2858
03:06:57,200 --> 03:06:59,040
uh we could go in either direction if

2859
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,840
anyone actually wants to like

2860
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:02,720
watch

2861
03:07:02,720 --> 03:07:06,319
a 20 or 25 or 30 minute shader showdown

2862
03:07:06,319 --> 03:07:07,920
from start to finish and just see how

2863
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:10,000
this works they're like there's a live

2864
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,319
dj they can actually use the live dj's

2865
03:07:12,319 --> 03:07:13,920
audio as input

2866
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:16,560
while they're writing a shader um and

2867
03:07:16,560 --> 03:07:18,160
you know there are people narrating and

2868
03:07:18,160 --> 03:07:20,080
being like what's what the is going

2869
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:22,800
on here and some of the narrators are

2870
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:25,760
like i have no idea usually at revision

2871
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:27,279
which is i think what this shader

2872
03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:28,800
showdown is from they actually have a

2873
03:07:28,800 --> 03:07:31,200
very good idea of what's going on

2874
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:32,800
uh but

2875
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:34,720
we can choose your own adventure again

2876
03:07:34,720 --> 03:07:36,399
do we want atari first or we want the

2877
03:07:36,399 --> 03:07:39,200
shader showdown first i can show these

2878
03:07:39,200 --> 03:07:40,560
uh

2879
03:07:40,560 --> 03:07:42,080
and then i probably have to get out of

2880
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:44,640
here and actually go to sleep

2881
03:07:44,640 --> 03:07:47,120
uh if i can break in here um

2882
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:48,479
you know you are actually the last

2883
03:07:48,479 --> 03:07:50,560
person on schedule so you can go right

2884
03:07:50,560 --> 03:07:53,840
till 10 am if you want to

2885
03:07:54,560 --> 03:07:57,600
it's a tempting offer

2886
03:07:58,960 --> 03:08:01,279
how long can you go

2887
03:08:01,279 --> 03:08:03,200
well i think we should have last person

2888
03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:04,399
standing here

2889
03:08:04,399 --> 03:08:05,279
all right

2890
03:08:05,279 --> 03:08:09,359
how about we watch the atari demo first

2891
03:08:10,399 --> 03:08:12,399
uh i want to show you one more retro

2892
03:08:12,399 --> 03:08:14,000
thing let's let's watch the atari thing

2893
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,399
and then we'll watch a shader showdown

2894
03:08:16,399 --> 03:08:20,960
uh does does anyone have any questions

2895
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:22,399
like you can literally just ask me

2896
03:08:22,399 --> 03:08:24,800
anything i guess but uh you know about

2897
03:08:24,800 --> 03:08:27,679
demos probably

2898
03:08:29,439 --> 03:08:33,160
green maybe black

2899
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:42,720
i don't know why don't you be the first

2900
03:08:42,720 --> 03:08:43,600
to

2901
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:45,120
figure out if you can do a demo on a

2902
03:08:45,120 --> 03:08:48,120
non-computer

2903
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:52,560
i can't see hands so you just have to

2904
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:55,920
yell at me if you had something

2905
03:09:00,080 --> 03:09:03,840
all right atari demo it is

2906
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:08,560
oops that is the wrong display again

2907
03:09:08,560 --> 03:09:12,240
i'm really good at this can you tell

2908
03:09:14,319 --> 03:09:16,240
i guess maybe what i should do since i'm

2909
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:17,840
just basically running out the clock at

2910
03:09:17,840 --> 03:09:19,200
this point

2911
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:21,120
um i'd uh

2912
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:23,439
i've i brought cds to sell but they're

2913
03:09:23,439 --> 03:09:24,720
all gone

2914
03:09:24,720 --> 03:09:26,880
uh so thanks for your support

2915
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:29,120
uh i do still have a couple pretty eight

2916
03:09:29,120 --> 03:09:31,279
machine vinyl which is the first nine

2917
03:09:31,279 --> 03:09:32,640
inch nails album on eight different

2918
03:09:32,640 --> 03:09:34,399
8-bit machines

2919
03:09:34,399 --> 03:09:37,680
um and 650 people were crazy enough to

2920
03:09:37,680 --> 03:09:41,600
pre-order this so i ordered 300 more

2921
03:09:41,600 --> 03:09:43,120
so i've got like a couple of those in my

2922
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:45,040
bag if anyone wants to

2923
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:47,840
help support my food budget or my uh

2924
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:49,680
living budget

2925
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:50,960

but uh yeah you can hit me up after this

2927
03:09:53,680 --> 03:09:55,760
or even really during this since we're

2928
03:09:55,760 --> 03:09:57,359
really just sitting here watching demos

2929
03:09:57,359 --> 03:09:59,120
i've never actually i've skimmed this

2930
03:09:59,120 --> 03:10:01,200
demo but i haven't run it run it and

2931
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:02,880
like watch the entire thing so i might

2932
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:04,960
just come down there and watch it on the

2933
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:06,160
big screen

2934
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:09,680
instead of like killing my neck

2935

2944
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:30,000

2956
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:58,640
like a song by kesha

2957
03:10:58,880 --> 03:11:02,080
all right atari demo

2958
03:11:05,439 --> 03:11:09,840

3009
03:22:46,239 --> 03:22:49,239
with

3010
03:23:09,279 --> 03:23:12,279
my

3011
03:23:37,200 --> 03:24:18,190
[Music]

3012
03:24:48,900 --> 03:25:29,639
[Music]

3013
03:25:59,920 --> 03:26:04,920
um but it couldn't have been too large

3014
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:12,040
um a lot of atari demos are using up to

3015
03:26:12,040 --> 03:26:15,200
320k of ram at this point

3016
03:26:15,200 --> 03:26:18,160
uh but that still isn't that much really

3017
03:26:18,160 --> 03:26:20,160
you know um

3018
03:26:20,160 --> 03:26:22,800
i don't know if that was a stock machine

3019
03:26:22,800 --> 03:26:25,200
or not the uh

3020
03:26:25,200 --> 03:26:27,439
the file name didn't specify i could

3021
03:26:27,439 --> 03:26:30,399
probably look it up real fast here

3022
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:33,279
i'm literally on the website that would

3023
03:26:33,279 --> 03:26:34,239
uh

3024
03:26:34,239 --> 03:26:37,760
specify some requirements

3025
03:26:38,560 --> 03:26:40,800
uh no so this uh there's there's a

3026
03:26:40,800 --> 03:26:44,560
confusion of atari's here the atari 2600

3027
03:26:44,560 --> 03:26:46,479
which is the game system

3028
03:26:46,479 --> 03:26:48,239
has no frame buffer

3029
03:26:48,239 --> 03:26:50,319
definitely does not have tiles uh only

3030
03:26:50,319 --> 03:26:52,479
has 128 bytes of ram

3031
03:26:52,479 --> 03:26:55,120
uh the atari computer

3032
03:26:55,120 --> 03:26:58,160
uh usually comes stock with say i mean

3033
03:26:58,160 --> 03:27:01,760
an atari 400 had 16k and atari 800 had

3034
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:03,040
48k

3035
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:06,160
800 xl would have 64k

3036
03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:11,680
um the 130 xe would have 128k

3037
03:27:11,680 --> 03:27:15,279
and this totally has a frame buffer and

3038
03:27:15,279 --> 03:27:17,439
uh you know the the sound chip is much

3039
03:27:17,439 --> 03:27:19,200
better as you can hear you know you have

3040
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:21,920
more than 32 notes and they're not

3041
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:23,840
terribly dissonant

3042
03:27:23,840 --> 03:27:26,479
um so the atari when when someone says

3043
03:27:26,479 --> 03:27:28,880
uh atari 8-bit they're referring to the

3044
03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:30,640
computer line

3045
03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:34,160
and when they say atari 2600 or tia or

3046
03:27:34,160 --> 03:27:35,600
vcs

3047
03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:37,520
uh they're specifically referring to the

3048
03:27:37,520 --> 03:27:40,239
2600

3049
03:27:40,640 --> 03:27:44,960
yeah no problem um so yeah that was uh

3050
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:48,000
ain't nobody writing doom for the 2600

3051
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:49,680
and not making it look like that but

3052
03:27:49,680 --> 03:27:51,279
that still is an impressive feat

3053
03:27:51,279 --> 03:27:52,239
actually

3054
03:27:52,239 --> 03:27:54,239
uh all things considered the atari 8-bit

3055
03:27:54,239 --> 03:27:57,479
computer is still only a 1.79 megahertz

3056
03:27:57,479 --> 03:27:59,279
6502

3057
03:27:59,279 --> 03:28:01,760
uh so like having

3058
03:28:01,760 --> 03:28:02,560
a

3059
03:28:02,560 --> 03:28:03,840
like a

3060
03:28:03,840 --> 03:28:07,439
raycasting engine on it is like insane

3061
03:28:07,439 --> 03:28:09,120
um they did

3062
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:10,560
some pretty amazing stuff with that

3063
03:28:10,560 --> 03:28:13,119
hardware

3064
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:15,359
so

3065
03:28:15,359 --> 03:28:18,399
we have a shader showdown that should be

3066
03:28:18,399 --> 03:28:20,479
watched

3067
03:28:20,479 --> 03:28:23,720
and uh

3068
03:28:24,720 --> 03:28:26,640
so a black ops black hole tell us a

3069
03:28:26,640 --> 03:28:29,040
little bit about your previous uh round

3070
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:31,279
or how stressful was so these are people

3071
03:28:31,279 --> 03:28:32,720
the empty cores

3072
03:28:32,720 --> 03:28:34,640
fighting shaders against each other and

3073
03:28:34,640 --> 03:28:38,160
you'll see the person's name

3074
03:28:42,720 --> 03:28:45,779
[Music]

3075
03:28:49,840 --> 03:28:52,000
so one of the things that people will do

3076
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:54,399
is i didn't have much time left not hit

3077
03:28:54,399 --> 03:28:56,080
save while they write a whole bunch of

3078
03:28:56,080 --> 03:28:58,319
code and then use it as kind of a

3079
03:28:58,319 --> 03:28:59,760
clincher moment

3080
03:28:59,760 --> 03:29:01,200
and uh i just started and you'll see

3081
03:29:01,200 --> 03:29:02,640
that

3082
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:04,640
so anyway i'll let this run you can see

3083
03:29:04,640 --> 03:29:05,680
you know

3084
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:08,080
all the people that this is about

3085
03:29:08,080 --> 03:29:10,160
from revision 2021

3086
03:29:10,160 --> 03:29:11,439
the idea for the fact

3087
03:29:11,439 --> 03:29:12,960
so this was

3088
03:29:12,960 --> 03:29:14,960
entirely online everyone was being a

3089
03:29:14,960 --> 03:29:17,359
commentator over discord and whatever

3090
03:29:17,359 --> 03:29:20,080
and i did a pac-man thieved thing back

3091
03:29:20,080 --> 03:29:22,399
then so it was sort of like

3092
03:29:22,399 --> 03:29:24,239
pulling forward i already had done i

3093
03:29:24,239 --> 03:29:27,920
guess going back but uh

3094
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:29,690
with diffusion now

3095
03:29:29,690 --> 03:29:32,239
[Music]

3096
03:29:32,239 --> 03:29:34,399
had you ever done uh action refusing

3097
03:29:34,399 --> 03:29:36,800
stuff before or uh no

3098
03:29:36,800 --> 03:29:37,680
okay

3099
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,800
awesome

3100
03:29:38,800 --> 03:29:41,040
how stressful was that to try to very

3101
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:43,200
very it was very special i like stood in

3102
03:29:43,200 --> 03:29:44,880
my i stood in my bedroom and i sort of

3103
03:29:44,880 --> 03:29:47,040
sung to myself what the formulas were so

3104
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:49,200
i could remember it oh wow

3105
03:29:49,200 --> 03:29:51,520
you're already on side

3106
03:29:51,520 --> 03:29:53,200
we have a sphere

3107
03:29:53,200 --> 03:29:54,960
we're both already in it like

3108
03:29:54,960 --> 03:29:57,600
immediately as you said started coding

3109
03:29:57,600 --> 03:29:59,040
this is going to be rough both had great

3110
03:29:59,040 --> 03:30:00,800
effects yesterday i mean it's going to

3111
03:30:00,800 --> 03:30:03,120
be a good battle i'm very excited to see

3112
03:30:03,120 --> 03:30:04,560
what evil comes up with because evil we

3113
03:30:04,560 --> 03:30:07,600
saw that giant um pyramid and the entire

3114
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:09,840
like castle around it and now he wasn't

3115
03:30:09,840 --> 03:30:12,560
just a full full city and with

3116
03:30:12,560 --> 03:30:15,520
philippine we had more of a story-driven

3117
03:30:15,520 --> 03:30:17,120
idea of like a

3118
03:30:17,120 --> 03:30:19,279
i guess a glowing cube going off on a

3119
03:30:19,279 --> 03:30:22,399
quest i would say we put it all away go

3120
03:30:22,399 --> 03:30:24,640
to the bathroom at revision

3121
03:30:24,640 --> 03:30:27,760
it's a very long tunnel

3122
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:30,720
so it takes a while i it felt a little

3123
03:30:30,720 --> 03:30:34,640
bit like philippine was redoing the cube

3124
03:30:34,640 --> 03:30:36,960
demo that she she made a couple years

3125
03:30:36,960 --> 03:30:40,000
ago uh but inside uh

3126
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:42,560
a tunnel corridor instead of the open

3127
03:30:42,560 --> 03:30:44,720
air like in the demo but it was a good

3128
03:30:44,720 --> 03:30:46,720
idea i think it worked pretty well i was

3129
03:30:46,720 --> 03:30:48,640
i was a sucker for a writer's effect

3130
03:30:48,640 --> 03:30:50,160
though on that particular challenge i

3131
03:30:50,160 --> 03:30:52,080
really like the aesthetic of his but

3132
03:30:52,080 --> 03:30:54,640
very different from what we normally see

3133
03:30:54,640 --> 03:30:55,680
yeah

3134
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:57,439
that's something i would have wanted to

3135
03:30:57,439 --> 03:30:59,520
ask you about like all the diversity of

3136
03:30:59,520 --> 03:31:01,520
the different shaders do you prefer the

3137
03:31:01,520 --> 03:31:03,520
3d stuff do you think that usually gets

3138
03:31:03,520 --> 03:31:06,560
the votes or do you like the

3139
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:09,359
different experiments more

3140
03:31:09,359 --> 03:31:11,520
i absolutely love to see variance or

3141
03:31:11,520 --> 03:31:12,479
variety

3142
03:31:12,479 --> 03:31:15,600
um i think like with 3d it's actually

3143
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:16,399
um

3144
03:31:16,399 --> 03:31:18,080
you can fall into this trap where like

3145
03:31:18,080 --> 03:31:20,160
it doesn't like it's 3d but there's no

3146
03:31:20,160 --> 03:31:21,840
like you don't really take use of it

3147
03:31:21,840 --> 03:31:22,880
like there's not a lot of camera

3148
03:31:22,880 --> 03:31:24,960
movement there's no like the models

3149
03:31:24,960 --> 03:31:27,040
aren't really like moving

3150
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:29,279
um and with 2d you sort of have a lot of

3151
03:31:29,279 --> 03:31:32,239
control over like um like you have if

3152
03:31:32,239 --> 03:31:33,680
you have less things to have to deal

3153
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:35,359
with so you can control more things like

3154
03:31:35,359 --> 03:31:36,560
animation

3155
03:31:36,560 --> 03:31:37,760
and like

3156
03:31:37,760 --> 03:31:39,439
placing things better and that kind of

3157
03:31:39,439 --> 03:31:41,359
thing yeah um

3158
03:31:41,359 --> 03:31:43,200
like even then the shader i just did the

3159
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:45,680
pac-man s3d but like the only thing you

3160
03:31:45,680 --> 03:31:47,439
get from that is the shading

3161
03:31:47,439 --> 03:31:50,000
so yeah it's it's 3d but like is it

3162
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:53,439
really 3d so um yeah it's definitely

3163
03:31:53,439 --> 03:31:57,120
like a a deal where um

3164
03:31:57,359 --> 03:31:59,680
how would you say uh

3165
03:31:59,680 --> 03:32:01,040
like with 2d things like you could

3166
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:02,000
really

3167
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:03,760
there's there's like with art you can do

3168
03:32:03,760 --> 03:32:06,840
like so many things more control

3169
03:32:06,840 --> 03:32:08,880
yeah and it's unconstrained as well you

3170
03:32:08,880 --> 03:32:10,479
have everything is a trade-off that you

3171
03:32:10,479 --> 03:32:11,920
decide to do so

3172
03:32:11,920 --> 03:32:14,239
give us a bit more good i guess

3173
03:32:14,239 --> 03:32:15,279
yeah but yeah

3174
03:32:15,279 --> 03:32:17,439
generally easier to think of like it's

3175
03:32:17,439 --> 03:32:20,000
it's very it's

3176
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:23,040
3d is like kind of a pretty to

3177
03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:25,439
swear on stream but it's it's

3178
03:32:25,439 --> 03:32:28,319
it's harder than mine but 2d is very

3179
03:32:28,319 --> 03:32:29,840
very pleasant to work

3180
03:32:29,840 --> 03:32:31,680
it's more intuitive in a way because you

3181
03:32:31,680 --> 03:32:33,120
can see immediately on the screen what

3182
03:32:33,120 --> 03:32:34,640
you're working on and tell us a little

3183
03:32:34,640 --> 03:32:37,040
bit about that uh mathematical function

3184
03:32:37,040 --> 03:32:38,560
that you were using to make the pac-man

3185
03:32:38,560 --> 03:32:41,120
jump around the sign with a sign with a

3186
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:43,040
tangent we were trying to

3187
03:32:43,040 --> 03:32:43,920
d

3188
03:32:43,920 --> 03:32:45,760
decrypt it a little bit on stream so it

3189
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:47,760
would be cool if you had like an insight

3190
03:32:47,760 --> 03:32:49,200
from you on that that's the it's

3191
03:32:49,200 --> 03:32:50,560
probably the most inefficient way to

3192
03:32:50,560 --> 03:32:52,399
make a triangle wave so basically it's a

3193
03:32:52,399 --> 03:32:53,520
yeah

3194
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:55,279
it's like it's like a wave where it goes

3195
03:32:55,279 --> 03:32:57,279
up and then it hits its maximum and then

3196
03:32:57,279 --> 03:32:58,960
it reverses direction and goes back down

3197
03:32:58,960 --> 03:33:01,040
so you can make that using uh by passing

3198
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:03,600
aside or sine into a sine it's very slow

3199
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:04,960
because they sign i think is one of the

3200
03:33:04,960 --> 03:33:07,279
slowest operations on the graphics card

3201
03:33:07,279 --> 03:33:09,600
but uh it's very easy to remember so

3202
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:12,239
it's perfect for shader showdown

3203
03:33:12,239 --> 03:33:14,560
okay until your computer starts melting

3204
03:33:14,560 --> 03:33:17,279
from yes exactly possessing power

3205
03:33:17,279 --> 03:33:19,120
it's okay if this guard can handle it

3206
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:21,600
that's fine

3207
03:33:21,600 --> 03:33:24,239
yeah i have some switching yesterday

3208
03:33:24,239 --> 03:33:25,439
evening

3209
03:33:25,439 --> 03:33:28,239
at some moment

3210
03:33:28,720 --> 03:33:31,439
19 minutes left still on the clock we

3211
03:33:31,439 --> 03:33:34,080
still only see two spheres on screen

3212
03:33:34,080 --> 03:33:36,239
even slightly more stylish with that

3213
03:33:36,239 --> 03:33:38,399
background but i think we're seeing a

3214
03:33:38,399 --> 03:33:40,640
visualization of the distance field on

3215
03:33:40,640 --> 03:33:42,560
what the inside where we're basically

3216
03:33:42,560 --> 03:33:44,560
seeing um actually it could be a fog

3217
03:33:44,560 --> 03:33:45,920
effect now that i look at it but

3218
03:33:45,920 --> 03:33:48,239
basically as the as our ray passes our

3219
03:33:48,239 --> 03:33:50,239
object we can track what the closest

3220
03:33:50,239 --> 03:33:52,319
distance it got was and then i could

3221
03:33:52,319 --> 03:33:54,160
tell that ray like even if it didn't hit

3222
03:33:54,160 --> 03:33:56,239
the object we can be like oh we actually

3223
03:33:56,239 --> 03:33:58,239
got like such and such close and we can

3224
03:33:58,239 --> 03:34:00,239
sort of get a fog effect from that or a

3225
03:34:00,239 --> 03:34:02,880
glow effect yeah glow i was gonna say

3226
03:34:02,880 --> 03:34:04,479
i've seen philippine use it as a glow a

3227
03:34:04,479 --> 03:34:05,600
few times

3228
03:34:05,600 --> 03:34:07,359
so looking forward to see what she's

3229
03:34:07,359 --> 03:34:09,120
gonna come up with but so far we don't

3230
03:34:09,120 --> 03:34:11,439
really have like a sense of oh some

3231
03:34:11,439 --> 03:34:13,120
lighting changes on evil that looks a

3232
03:34:13,120 --> 03:34:14,640
lot smoother now

3233
03:34:14,640 --> 03:34:17,120
really i always love right um on i

3234
03:34:17,120 --> 03:34:19,680
always love evil's lighting and evil's

3235
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:22,080
uh material models like you can see that

3236
03:34:22,080 --> 03:34:23,760
like it's not

3237
03:34:23,760 --> 03:34:26,000
so in computer graphics there's the fong

3238
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:28,080
shading model which is sort of the the

3239
03:34:28,080 --> 03:34:29,520
very basic model which has been around

3240
03:34:29,520 --> 03:34:32,319
since the 70s and you can see that um

3241
03:34:32,319 --> 03:34:35,120
although vigilant looks similar to fong

3242
03:34:35,120 --> 03:34:37,520
uh people's evil materials are a little

3243
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:38,960
bit more um

3244
03:34:38,960 --> 03:34:40,319
what's the word refined like there's

3245
03:34:40,319 --> 03:34:42,000
there's like some back scatter behind

3246
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:44,479
the sphere there's like yeah like a very

3247
03:34:44,479 --> 03:34:46,800
a very uh sharp highlight spot which is

3248
03:34:46,800 --> 03:34:47,840
very nice

3249
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:50,560
so like small details but really

3250
03:34:50,560 --> 03:34:53,520
brings realism to the thing absolutely

3251
03:34:53,520 --> 03:34:54,720
yeah and it's something that he's been

3252
03:34:54,720 --> 03:34:56,800
working on for the last couple of years

3253
03:34:56,800 --> 03:34:58,640
and i remember his streams from the

3254
03:34:58,640 --> 03:35:00,319
beginning and we were a lot more flat

3255
03:35:00,319 --> 03:35:03,120
shaded and based on glows and metallic

3256
03:35:03,120 --> 03:35:05,520
reflections and so he's been

3257
03:35:05,520 --> 03:35:07,359
fine-tuning those things meanwhile

3258
03:35:07,359 --> 03:35:09,920
philippine has a revision logo yeah in

3259
03:35:09,920 --> 03:35:12,960
the revision logo on fluffy inside which

3260
03:35:12,960 --> 03:35:13,840
is

3261
03:35:13,840 --> 03:35:16,399
i i we see it repeated but also um i

3262
03:35:16,399 --> 03:35:18,000
think maybe she was just centering it

3263
03:35:18,000 --> 03:35:19,680
but

3264
03:35:19,680 --> 03:35:21,890
um

3265
03:35:21,890 --> 03:35:24,319
[Music]

3266
03:35:24,319 --> 03:35:26,000
in a very like

3267
03:35:26,000 --> 03:35:27,439
distinguished

3268
03:35:27,439 --> 03:35:29,040
sphere

3269
03:35:29,040 --> 03:35:31,760
yeah very nice looking

3270
03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:34,160
spearing spear that is

3271
03:35:34,160 --> 03:35:35,600
fearing my

3272
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:36,880
uh

3273
03:35:36,880 --> 03:35:39,119
very

3274
03:35:39,680 --> 03:35:41,680
because i'm seeing the revision logo is

3275
03:35:41,680 --> 03:35:45,359
in 3d yeah so it is um

3276
03:35:45,359 --> 03:35:47,120
we are given a

3277
03:35:47,120 --> 03:35:49,920
two-dimensional revision logo and uh

3278
03:35:49,920 --> 03:35:51,279
normally when you do 3d you want to

3279
03:35:51,279 --> 03:35:53,359
assign distance functions so you want to

3280
03:35:53,359 --> 03:35:55,120
know how far away you are from the

3281
03:35:55,120 --> 03:35:56,239
surface

3282
03:35:56,239 --> 03:35:57,920
um technically

3283
03:35:57,920 --> 03:36:00,560
i think writer provided the sdf of that

3284
03:36:00,560 --> 03:36:01,680
i'm not sure

3285
03:36:01,680 --> 03:36:03,200
we weren't given it we were just giving

3286
03:36:03,200 --> 03:36:04,000
yeah

3287
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:05,359
i think she's recalculating i'm

3288
03:36:05,359 --> 03:36:08,000
scrolling past her code here and uh she

3289
03:36:08,000 --> 03:36:09,920
she's basing it

3290
03:36:09,920 --> 03:36:12,399
she's doing the calculations based on

3291
03:36:12,399 --> 03:36:13,760
the texture

3292
03:36:13,760 --> 03:36:15,840
not using the sdf

3293
03:36:15,840 --> 03:36:17,680
right so yeah

3294
03:36:17,680 --> 03:36:20,319
so yeah we have a tunnel we have a

3295
03:36:20,319 --> 03:36:21,520
tunnel of

3296
03:36:21,520 --> 03:36:24,479
revision locals oh my god maybe we're

3297
03:36:24,479 --> 03:36:26,160
gonna fly through it that makes sense

3298
03:36:26,160 --> 03:36:29,359
yeah that will be very exciting

3299
03:36:29,359 --> 03:36:31,439
are you gonna hit the the the parts

3300
03:36:31,439 --> 03:36:32,800
though are you gonna

3301
03:36:32,800 --> 03:36:35,359
be able to go through the the slips in

3302
03:36:35,359 --> 03:36:37,439
the in the it's gonna be it's gonna be

3303
03:36:37,439 --> 03:36:39,840
like a game but you have to avoid them

3304
03:36:39,840 --> 03:36:42,160
ah

3305
03:36:42,160 --> 03:36:43,279
we're all on

3306
03:36:43,279 --> 03:36:45,279
board for the ride so

3307
03:36:45,279 --> 03:36:47,920
if we hit the wall it's all of us gone

3308
03:36:47,920 --> 03:36:50,080
maybe you can set up a box for the chat

3309
03:36:50,080 --> 03:36:52,080
so in the chat can control if the camera

3310
03:36:52,080 --> 03:36:53,840
goes left or right it should be it

3311
03:36:53,840 --> 03:36:56,720
should be doable right there we go

3312
03:36:56,720 --> 03:36:57,920
now

3313
03:36:57,920 --> 03:36:59,600
nice

3314
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:01,600
yeah that's pretty cool really stylish

3315
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:03,600
as well so we're not even at the halfway

3316
03:37:03,600 --> 03:37:06,560
point so it's it's all to play for so

3317
03:37:06,560 --> 03:37:08,800
there we go

3318
03:37:08,800 --> 03:37:12,160
this is absolutely yeah fantastic work

3319
03:37:12,160 --> 03:37:14,000
on flipping stream flying to revision

3320
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:15,060
logo

3321
03:37:15,060 --> 03:37:17,359
[Music]

3322
03:37:17,359 --> 03:37:18,960
yeah maybe we'll see some rotation of

3323
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:20,399
the logo as well

3324
03:37:20,399 --> 03:37:22,640
i'm very excited for it yeah you think

3325
03:37:22,640 --> 03:37:26,000
something like that would happen right

3326
03:37:26,319 --> 03:37:29,680
no philippines is going all out

3327
03:37:29,680 --> 03:37:32,239
absolutely oh evil just

3328
03:37:32,239 --> 03:37:34,479
doubled his chances of winning instead

3329
03:37:34,479 --> 03:37:36,399
of one oh he has two

3330
03:37:36,399 --> 03:37:38,720
wow it's still very well we noticed from

3331
03:37:38,720 --> 03:37:40,479
evil right he spent 10 minutes setting

3332
03:37:40,479 --> 03:37:43,520
up but it's still very modest

3333
03:37:43,520 --> 03:37:45,200
oh he's gonna turn it into a very

3334
03:37:45,200 --> 03:37:46,880
complex shape in the jiffy he's just

3335
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:47,680
gonna

3336
03:37:47,680 --> 03:37:49,760
put some fractals rotate this a couple

3337
03:37:49,760 --> 03:37:52,000
of times boom the whole world appears

3338
03:37:52,000 --> 03:37:53,680
that we shoot into the sphere and it's a

3339
03:37:53,680 --> 03:37:55,690
planet full of life

3340
03:37:55,690 --> 03:38:01,279
[Music]

3341
03:38:01,279 --> 03:38:03,760
we have 14 minutes and a half left so

3342
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:06,319
still plenty of time left to code

3343
03:38:06,319 --> 03:38:08,479
absolutely some so much can change too

3344
03:38:08,479 --> 03:38:09,600
like

3345
03:38:09,600 --> 03:38:10,479
uh

3346
03:38:10,479 --> 03:38:12,239
some of of these shaders showdowns their

3347
03:38:12,239 --> 03:38:13,439
rounds are 15 minutes in the

3348
03:38:13,439 --> 03:38:16,239
quarterfinals so that's 10 minutes less

3349
03:38:16,239 --> 03:38:18,319
than the standard 25 minutes

3350
03:38:18,319 --> 03:38:19,040
so

3351
03:38:19,040 --> 03:38:20,640
when even when there's 15 minutes left

3352
03:38:20,640 --> 03:38:21,760
you can think well

3353
03:38:21,760 --> 03:38:22,720
i could

3354
03:38:22,720 --> 03:38:24,239
if i did a quarter final that was 15

3355
03:38:24,239 --> 03:38:26,239
minutes like in that amount of time you

3356
03:38:26,239 --> 03:38:28,399
sort of it helps you gauge how much you

3357
03:38:28,399 --> 03:38:31,840
how much you can do in that time

3358
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:34,000
into the logo

3359
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:35,199
yeah it's moving

3360
03:38:35,199 --> 03:38:37,120
that was what i was fearing but i think

3361
03:38:37,120 --> 03:38:39,439
she has like a little bit of space where

3362
03:38:39,439 --> 03:38:41,520
nothing will ever touch it

3363
03:38:41,520 --> 03:38:43,359
except for the one little the one little

3364
03:38:43,359 --> 03:38:45,279
spit there's one spit that we crush into

3365
03:38:45,279 --> 03:38:48,640
oh there it moves it rotates

3366
03:38:50,640 --> 03:38:52,800
i love to see it this reminds me of lock

3367
03:38:52,800 --> 03:38:54,880
picking by some reason like i imagine

3368
03:38:54,880 --> 03:38:56,640
all those things be like

3369
03:38:56,640 --> 03:38:57,520
it does

3370
03:38:57,520 --> 03:38:58,640
it feels like we're hacking the

3371
03:38:58,640 --> 03:39:01,040
mainframe

3372
03:39:01,040 --> 03:39:03,920
but it's so and again like absolutely

3373
03:39:03,920 --> 03:39:06,319
too prose coding on the screen because

3374
03:39:06,319 --> 03:39:08,319
it looks so professional

3375
03:39:08,319 --> 03:39:10,720
philippine uh filipino uh black hole

3376
03:39:10,720 --> 03:39:12,960
question for you what i'm obviously

3377
03:39:12,960 --> 03:39:14,720
you're trying to be requested at this

3378
03:39:14,720 --> 03:39:17,840
moment yeah no oh look at evil

3379
03:39:17,840 --> 03:39:18,880
oh wow

3380
03:39:18,880 --> 03:39:21,120
oh wow

3381
03:39:21,120 --> 03:39:23,600
oh wow cersensky style uh sphere

3382
03:39:23,600 --> 03:39:25,680
duplication that's very cool so sir

3383
03:39:25,680 --> 03:39:27,680
spinski is a type of

3384
03:39:27,680 --> 03:39:30,880
the sphere is moving

3385
03:39:30,960 --> 03:39:32,640
a little bit

3386
03:39:32,640 --> 03:39:35,600
did i elucidate no i saw that as well

3387
03:39:35,600 --> 03:39:37,600
although i think it would be inevitable

3388
03:39:37,600 --> 03:39:39,120
so the question that i had from black

3389
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:41,439
girl was who who would you prefer to

3390
03:39:41,439 --> 03:39:43,199
have in the final against you but being

3391
03:39:43,199 --> 03:39:45,040
our evil do you have a favorite

3392
03:39:45,040 --> 03:39:46,000
um

3393
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:47,279
i'm trying to remember who i've gone up

3394
03:39:47,279 --> 03:39:48,399
against before because i've gone up

3395
03:39:48,399 --> 03:39:51,359
against evil and i was destroyed

3396
03:39:51,359 --> 03:39:52,399
so

3397
03:39:52,399 --> 03:39:54,399
do you want a rematch or do you just

3398
03:39:54,399 --> 03:39:55,439
want to win

3399
03:39:55,439 --> 03:39:57,439
destroy it a second time but

3400
03:39:57,439 --> 03:39:59,120
it'd be fun to have a i don't know if

3401
03:39:59,120 --> 03:40:00,960
i've gone up against bluffing before i

3402
03:40:00,960 --> 03:40:04,919
think that'd be very very funny

3403
03:40:10,640 --> 03:40:11,760
we have a little

3404
03:40:11,760 --> 03:40:14,399
pipe holding the revision logo in place

3405
03:40:14,399 --> 03:40:16,560
slightly off center but uh she'll

3406
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:18,479
eventually fix it and meanwhile evil is

3407
03:40:18,479 --> 03:40:21,359
just completely fractalizing it

3408
03:40:21,359 --> 03:40:23,040
all out i think i do not know what's

3409
03:40:23,040 --> 03:40:25,359
happening on evil street and i love it

3410
03:40:25,359 --> 03:40:26,319
boolean

3411
03:40:26,319 --> 03:40:28,880
subtractions or whatever is he doing

3412
03:40:28,880 --> 03:40:30,000
it's like

3413
03:40:30,000 --> 03:40:31,680
yeah i don't know it's like i almost

3414
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:33,279
think that it's like a cross section or

3415
03:40:33,279 --> 03:40:34,239
something

3416
03:40:34,239 --> 03:40:36,080
it looks fantastic though it's like

3417
03:40:36,080 --> 03:40:38,800
absolutely something completely new

3418
03:40:38,800 --> 03:40:40,560
and not like it's also something

3419
03:40:40,560 --> 03:40:44,720
extremely evil extremely evil absolutely

3420
03:40:44,720 --> 03:40:46,960
wow look look at the the bottom there

3421
03:40:46,960 --> 03:40:48,720
like the cylinders that stack on each

3422
03:40:48,720 --> 03:40:50,960
other makes like a weird form

3423
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:53,040
it's almost it's also we've got the um

3424
03:40:53,040 --> 03:40:55,359
isometric view that philippines is

3425
03:40:55,359 --> 03:40:56,640
played with where

3426
03:40:56,640 --> 03:40:58,479
is he messing with flopping by doing an

3427
03:40:58,479 --> 03:41:01,439
isometric shader oh my god what a move

3428
03:41:01,439 --> 03:41:02,280
what a power move

3429
03:41:02,280 --> 03:41:05,450
[Music]

3430
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:07,359
this reminds me of the executable

3431
03:41:07,359 --> 03:41:10,080
graphics as well due to the refined

3432
03:41:10,080 --> 03:41:12,239
detail of it all and

3433
03:41:12,239 --> 03:41:14,399
still have 11 minutes left to black hole

3434
03:41:14,399 --> 03:41:16,000
they want to talk talk to us a little

3435
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:17,760
bit about executable graphics did you do

3436
03:41:17,760 --> 03:41:19,840
anything for

3437
03:41:19,840 --> 03:41:22,000
um no spoilers but uh basically

3438
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:24,239
executable graphics is like what if we

3439
03:41:24,239 --> 03:41:25,920
pack one of these shader showdown

3440
03:41:25,920 --> 03:41:28,800
entries into a into a program which just

3441
03:41:28,800 --> 03:41:30,479
boots up renders something off screen

3442
03:41:30,479 --> 03:41:32,479
and shows it to you so it's like

3443
03:41:32,479 --> 03:41:34,479
if you can imagine bundling

3444
03:41:34,479 --> 03:41:36,160
a program like blender where you can

3445
03:41:36,160 --> 03:41:39,520
render like any anything any still image

3446
03:41:39,520 --> 03:41:40,960
what if you could bundle that all into a

3447
03:41:40,960 --> 03:41:42,800
program that's only four kilobytes big

3448
03:41:42,800 --> 03:41:45,520
do it with the code do it with shows

3449
03:41:45,520 --> 03:41:47,840
should be a really good uh

3450
03:41:47,840 --> 03:41:50,319
compo like last year was so great and a

3451
03:41:50,319 --> 03:41:52,000
lot of the people who participated last

3452
03:41:52,000 --> 03:41:53,680
year they were saying that they were

3453
03:41:53,680 --> 03:41:55,279
going to do something for this year as

3454
03:41:55,279 --> 03:41:56,720
well so i'm very really looking forward

3455
03:41:56,720 --> 03:41:58,560
to that coming up with the still image

3456
03:41:58,560 --> 03:42:01,199
you can use your code to actually light

3457
03:42:01,199 --> 03:42:03,439
and portray your image and it's such

3458
03:42:03,439 --> 03:42:04,640
awesome

3459
03:42:04,640 --> 03:42:06,640
yeah you can do some really like uh

3460
03:42:06,640 --> 03:42:08,720
what's the word um

3461
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:09,840
like you could do some things you can't

3462
03:42:09,840 --> 03:42:11,760
do in real time like path tracing you

3463
03:42:11,760 --> 03:42:14,239
can do like global illumination bounces

3464
03:42:14,239 --> 03:42:16,160
all that kind of thing

3465
03:42:16,160 --> 03:42:18,080
i'm very excited to see what happens we

3466
03:42:18,080 --> 03:42:20,080
had so many entries last year they were

3467
03:42:20,080 --> 03:42:20,880
awesome

3468
03:42:20,880 --> 03:42:22,880
such good stuff in there

3469
03:42:22,880 --> 03:42:26,960
so yeah some pipes on the side

3470
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:29,279
give them our industrial vibe to it yeah

3471
03:42:29,279 --> 03:42:30,640
we're in the subway

3472
03:42:30,640 --> 03:42:32,160
yeah we're in the revision subway this

3473
03:42:32,160 --> 03:42:34,000
is the new toyota tunnel this is the new

3474
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:35,680
toilet title you have to jump down and

3475
03:42:35,680 --> 03:42:38,960
not hit them oh my gosh

3476
03:42:38,960 --> 03:42:41,199
and only then can use the bathroom

3477
03:42:41,199 --> 03:42:44,960
giant massacre revision 2022 another

3478
03:42:44,960 --> 03:42:47,279
giant giant ventilator system to

3479
03:42:47,279 --> 03:42:48,800
ventilate the hall

3480
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:49,600
with the

3481
03:42:49,600 --> 03:42:53,720
logo rotating in it

3482
03:42:57,359 --> 03:42:59,439
though yeah it's absolutely they're both

3483
03:42:59,439 --> 03:43:01,760
looking fantastic

3484
03:43:01,760 --> 03:43:05,199
and that the evil screen is just as well

3485
03:43:05,199 --> 03:43:07,040
4k graphics absolutely i want and the

3486
03:43:07,040 --> 03:43:09,359
background color is so nice it's not

3487
03:43:09,359 --> 03:43:11,040
even moving yet i assume he's gonna make

3488
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:12,720
it move i

3489
03:43:12,720 --> 03:43:15,199
maybe he isn't how absolutely daring

3490
03:43:15,199 --> 03:43:16,720
would that be he's just portraying a

3491
03:43:16,720 --> 03:43:18,080
really cool image i think he would

3492
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:21,680
actually get away with it at this point

3493
03:43:21,680 --> 03:43:23,520
i i've never i don't think i've seen

3494
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:25,680
someone have a still image for shaver

3495
03:43:25,680 --> 03:43:27,840
showdown yeah exactly

3496
03:43:27,840 --> 03:43:29,760
if it's gonna happen in any at any event

3497
03:43:29,760 --> 03:43:33,040
i think revision would be the one

3498
03:43:33,040 --> 03:43:33,439
this yeah

3499
03:43:33,439 --> 03:43:35,520
this whole chatty shoutout has been

3500
03:43:35,520 --> 03:43:37,920
fantastically out of the box so

3501
03:43:37,920 --> 03:43:40,160
i'm super excited very different from

3502
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:42,960
what we normally see in these cars

3503
03:43:42,960 --> 03:43:45,680
so awesome to see you grow and everybody

3504
03:43:45,680 --> 03:43:48,800
is always doing their a game it's it's

3505
03:43:48,800 --> 03:43:49,920
absolutely

3506
03:43:49,920 --> 03:43:52,399
fantastic to look at and also

3507
03:43:52,399 --> 03:43:54,000
if you if you were here at this point

3508
03:43:54,000 --> 03:43:55,760
what would you add on flop inside and

3509
03:43:55,760 --> 03:43:58,080
what would you add on evil side

3510
03:43:58,080 --> 03:43:59,520
what i would love to see on philippine

3511
03:43:59,520 --> 03:44:02,399
side is that the individual components

3512
03:44:02,399 --> 03:44:04,000
of the revision logo it rotating

3513
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:06,160
differently i'm not sure if that's like

3514
03:44:06,160 --> 03:44:08,720
feasible within that as well with the

3515
03:44:08,720 --> 03:44:10,640
technical framework that philippine has

3516
03:44:10,640 --> 03:44:11,359
like

3517
03:44:11,359 --> 03:44:13,920
um i did it in my shader but it was just

3518
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:15,760
a still image like i wasn't i wasn't

3519
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:17,279
tracing through it was just a texture

3520
03:44:17,279 --> 03:44:18,960
but when you're tracing through it i

3521
03:44:18,960 --> 03:44:20,479
mentioned this in previous rounds but

3522
03:44:20,479 --> 03:44:22,080
whenever you're tracing through

3523
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:24,720
um a 3d scene certain mathematical

3524
03:44:24,720 --> 03:44:26,080
constraints have to be satisfied

3525
03:44:26,080 --> 03:44:28,160
otherwise you get like visual glitches

3526
03:44:28,160 --> 03:44:29,040
so

3527
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:30,800
it could be that if you rotate each one

3528
03:44:30,800 --> 03:44:32,160
individually it might break those

3529
03:44:32,160 --> 03:44:33,520
constraints and everything sort of

3530
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:37,600
messes up which would look great

3531
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:41,439
what we want here is artistic control

3532
03:44:41,439 --> 03:44:42,720
the only the only thing bad about

3533
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:44,160
glitches is that they take artistic

3534
03:44:44,160 --> 03:44:45,840
control away

3535
03:44:45,840 --> 03:44:48,239
what about evil's evil evils fractal

3536
03:44:48,239 --> 03:44:49,920
city what will you change in evil's

3537
03:44:49,920 --> 03:44:51,760
fractal city to make it

3538
03:44:51,760 --> 03:44:53,279
i want to see movement i want to see

3539
03:44:53,279 --> 03:44:54,880
movement so bad i want to see this thing

3540
03:44:54,880 --> 03:44:56,720
i want to see either the camera moving

3541
03:44:56,720 --> 03:44:58,880
flying through or i want to see it just

3542
03:44:58,880 --> 03:44:59,840
warping

3543
03:44:59,840 --> 03:45:02,720
yeah moving and rebuilding itself i

3544
03:45:02,720 --> 03:45:03,600
think

3545
03:45:03,600 --> 03:45:06,399
small objects flying through it yeah

3546
03:45:06,399 --> 03:45:08,880
even that like but i i would also

3547
03:45:08,880 --> 03:45:10,479
actually be happy if it stayed still

3548
03:45:10,479 --> 03:45:13,040
because there would be such a baltimore

3549
03:45:13,040 --> 03:45:16,239
i would appreciate it really

3550
03:45:16,239 --> 03:45:17,920
yeah it's a fantastic round again it's

3551
03:45:17,920 --> 03:45:19,199
like nine minutes on the clock eight

3552
03:45:19,199 --> 03:45:20,640
minutes we're actually getting near

3553
03:45:20,640 --> 03:45:22,080
seven minutes left

3554
03:45:22,080 --> 03:45:24,239
yeah

3555
03:45:24,319 --> 03:45:25,680
seven minutes and a half you've heard

3556
03:45:25,680 --> 03:45:27,760
about a minute and a half and not no

3557
03:45:27,760 --> 03:45:30,720
movement in evil shadow yet

3558
03:45:30,720 --> 03:45:33,600
it's looking extremely intricate these

3559
03:45:33,600 --> 03:45:36,960
seven finals man it's absolutely

3560
03:45:36,960 --> 03:45:39,960
terrifying

3561
03:45:40,239 --> 03:45:42,800
unaccelerating i'm really because i've

3562
03:45:42,800 --> 03:45:44,640
yeah we have seen detailing i think in

3563
03:45:44,640 --> 03:45:45,920
the evening

3564
03:45:45,920 --> 03:45:47,600
someone made the joke that uh evil

3565
03:45:47,600 --> 03:45:49,359
shader the encoder really likes evil

3566
03:45:49,359 --> 03:45:51,840
shaders

3567
03:45:52,880 --> 03:45:55,198
actually

3568
03:46:02,479 --> 03:46:03,920
the cube in the middle for rotating

3569
03:46:03,920 --> 03:46:06,840
queue but it's gone now

3570
03:46:06,840 --> 03:46:09,520
yeah sneakily showing up

3571
03:46:09,520 --> 03:46:11,359
maybe that's the cube from last last

3572
03:46:11,359 --> 03:46:14,000
round does that help to finish its quest

3573
03:46:14,000 --> 03:46:15,760
yeah it's really supposed to fly there

3574
03:46:15,760 --> 03:46:17,600
it is it is and again

3575
03:46:17,600 --> 03:46:19,120
like last round

3576
03:46:19,120 --> 03:46:20,840
it's tumbling all

3577
03:46:20,840 --> 03:46:24,479
along i just do collision detection now

3578
03:46:24,479 --> 03:46:27,359
and then the physics inside the shader

3579
03:46:27,359 --> 03:46:29,600
yeah

3580
03:46:29,760 --> 03:46:32,080
five minutes left time enough

3581
03:46:32,080 --> 03:46:33,680
i'm sure you could do with the previous

3582
03:46:33,680 --> 03:46:37,199
frame texture um it just

3583
03:46:37,199 --> 03:46:38,239
i don't know if you'd be able to

3584
03:46:38,239 --> 03:46:39,600
improvise it

3585
03:46:39,600 --> 03:46:40,560
yeah

3586
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:42,560
about six minutes left to do it

3587
03:46:42,560 --> 03:46:45,199
um we probably should repeat what the

3588
03:46:45,199 --> 03:46:47,199
hell we're actually doing here in case

3589
03:46:47,199 --> 03:46:49,359
there are new people around so uh black

3590
03:46:49,359 --> 03:46:51,920
will be wanna explain once more what it

3591
03:46:51,920 --> 03:46:55,120
is exactly that a shader coding entails

3592
03:46:55,120 --> 03:46:56,800
absolutely i always love to explain

3593
03:46:56,800 --> 03:46:58,960
shaders to people so basically what's

3594
03:46:58,960 --> 03:47:00,479
happening on screen right now is we have

3595
03:47:00,479 --> 03:47:02,080
two programmers one on the left and one

3596
03:47:02,080 --> 03:47:04,000
on the right and they have 25 minutes to

3597
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:06,399
program from scratch visual

3598
03:47:06,399 --> 03:47:07,680
and they're programming this in a

3599
03:47:07,680 --> 03:47:09,840
language called glsl which compiles and

3600
03:47:09,840 --> 03:47:11,760
runs directly on the graphics card so

3601
03:47:11,760 --> 03:47:13,680
for each pixel this program that they're

3602
03:47:13,680 --> 03:47:15,279
running gets invoked and they

3603
03:47:15,279 --> 03:47:16,640
essentially just get the x and y

3604
03:47:16,640 --> 03:47:18,319
coordinates of the pixel and if they

3605
03:47:18,319 --> 03:47:20,720
have to decide in the code for that x

3606
03:47:20,720 --> 03:47:22,800
and y position what color does it need

3607
03:47:22,800 --> 03:47:23,760
to be

3608
03:47:23,760 --> 03:47:25,359
um they get some other inputs like they

3609
03:47:25,359 --> 03:47:26,960
get that current time they get some

3610
03:47:26,960 --> 03:47:29,120
textures that they can sample they get

3611
03:47:29,120 --> 03:47:30,720
the previous frame they can sample that

3612
03:47:30,720 --> 03:47:34,000
as a texture um and also the fft which

3613
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:36,000
is the spectrum of the audio that's

3614
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:38,000
playing so that uh that allows them to

3615
03:47:38,000 --> 03:47:39,920
do um audio reactive shaders if they

3616
03:47:39,920 --> 03:47:42,720
want to so as the music that uh who's uh

3617
03:47:42,720 --> 03:47:45,439
who's djing this round

3618
03:47:45,439 --> 03:47:47,520
yeah ronnie's great music um could

3619
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:49,520
influence these shaders if the coder is

3620
03:47:49,520 --> 03:47:51,439
so pleased so how much time do we have

3621
03:47:51,439 --> 03:47:52,880
left by the way

3622
03:47:52,880 --> 03:47:54,800
five minutes five minutes okay and i

3623
03:47:54,800 --> 03:47:56,399
love i loved your explanation of like

3624
03:47:56,399 --> 03:47:58,319
for every x and y for every pixel it

3625
03:47:58,319 --> 03:47:59,760
gets to determine what the color is and

3626
03:47:59,760 --> 03:48:00,960
you look at these two effects you go

3627
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:01,760
like

3628
03:48:01,760 --> 03:48:04,560
how what

3629
03:48:04,720 --> 03:48:07,040
so that's how evil made that blue he

3630
03:48:07,040 --> 03:48:09,760
just decided what pixel it should be yes

3631
03:48:09,760 --> 03:48:11,040
exactly

3632
03:48:11,040 --> 03:48:13,199
like there's there's a sphere here what

3633
03:48:13,199 --> 03:48:14,640
color should it be oh it's going to be

3634
03:48:14,640 --> 03:48:15,680
blue

3635
03:48:15,680 --> 03:48:17,920
i'm really i'm really wondering if evo

3636
03:48:17,920 --> 03:48:20,319
is making a static image it's absolutely

3637
03:48:20,319 --> 03:48:22,560
it would be such a ballsy move it would

3638
03:48:22,560 --> 03:48:24,720
be and and philippine with her indeed

3639
03:48:24,720 --> 03:48:26,319
the cube is now falling down revision to

3640
03:48:26,319 --> 03:48:28,239
always look looks absolutely fantastic

3641
03:48:28,239 --> 03:48:29,840
like it's flopping

3642
03:48:29,840 --> 03:48:33,199
in pro form it looks very fluffy as well

3643
03:48:33,199 --> 03:48:36,080
like the whole glow and the the bright

3644
03:48:36,080 --> 03:48:37,840
color sort of thing

3645
03:48:37,840 --> 03:48:40,840
both are shaders not super

3646
03:48:40,840 --> 03:48:43,840
colorful her theme for this revision

3647
03:48:43,840 --> 03:48:46,160
yeah do you think that uh

3648
03:48:46,160 --> 03:48:47,920
i think that last time she did some

3649
03:48:47,920 --> 03:48:49,359
previous frame stuff where we had this

3650
03:48:49,359 --> 03:48:53,359
weird fog effect or like uh

3651
03:48:54,479 --> 03:48:56,640
i like this keep it full bean please

3652
03:48:56,640 --> 03:48:59,439
keep it looks great oh my god five

3653
03:48:59,439 --> 03:49:00,800
minutes on the clock and this is again

3654
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:02,880
like it was the previous round and i'm

3655
03:49:02,880 --> 03:49:05,199
looking at you black hole oh colors look

3656
03:49:05,199 --> 03:49:08,239
lights lights evil city has like oh my

3657
03:49:08,239 --> 03:49:10,479
god

3658
03:49:10,479 --> 03:49:12,319
is going for an aesthetic image i think

3659
03:49:12,319 --> 03:49:14,640
and it's looking absolutely gorgeous

3660
03:49:14,640 --> 03:49:16,399
this is again going to be tied to the

3661
03:49:16,399 --> 03:49:19,120
last minute like the previous round

3662
03:49:19,120 --> 03:49:22,160
oh my god my heart my poor heart

3663
03:49:22,160 --> 03:49:24,479
again the semi-final

3664
03:49:24,479 --> 03:49:27,279
yeah no matter oh it moves it moves

3665
03:49:27,279 --> 03:49:30,640
there we go in the last few minutes

3666
03:49:30,640 --> 03:49:33,359
again isometric maybe uh

3667
03:49:33,359 --> 03:49:36,840
not not technical ah multiple

3668
03:49:36,840 --> 03:49:37,040
points this is absolutely looking so

3669
03:49:37,040 --> 03:49:37,920
yes there camera

3670
03:49:40,080 --> 03:49:42,720
baller evil three minutes left to polish

3671
03:49:42,720 --> 03:49:45,279
this up philippine evil give it all you

3672
03:49:45,279 --> 03:49:47,680
got this is an amazing round

3673
03:49:47,680 --> 03:49:50,239
for this round who is gonna yeah who is

3674
03:49:50,239 --> 03:49:52,080
gonna take it up against black hole in

3675
03:49:52,080 --> 03:49:54,080
the final and black it is not worried at

3676
03:49:54,080 --> 03:49:56,080
all

3677
03:49:56,080 --> 03:49:57,660
no pressure in my mouth

3678
03:49:57,660 --> 03:50:00,800
[Laughter]

3679
03:50:00,800 --> 03:50:02,160
no biggie

3680
03:50:02,160 --> 03:50:03,680
no pressure

3681
03:50:03,680 --> 03:50:06,399
uh black will tell us a little bit about

3682
03:50:06,399 --> 03:50:08,160
what is the difference between coding by

3683
03:50:08,160 --> 03:50:09,600
the shader showdown and coding for like

3684
03:50:09,600 --> 03:50:12,319
the shader jam that we've been seeing as

3685
03:50:12,319 --> 03:50:14,800
well flopping just disappeared it's

3686
03:50:14,800 --> 03:50:17,040
evaporated oh my god now this is going

3687
03:50:17,040 --> 03:50:19,279
to be those 10s last minutes yeah two

3688
03:50:19,279 --> 03:50:21,760
minutes

3689
03:50:21,760 --> 03:50:23,760
is it more stressful or for the shade

3690
03:50:23,760 --> 03:50:25,359
well obviously it's more stressful but

3691
03:50:25,359 --> 03:50:29,040
which one do you enjoy more

3692
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:32,720
yeah uh i like freestyle because you can

3693
03:50:32,720 --> 03:50:35,439
sort of like uh experiment like

3694
03:50:35,439 --> 03:50:36,880
with shader showdown you can experiment

3695
03:50:36,880 --> 03:50:38,239
with new things that you really really

3696
03:50:38,239 --> 03:50:40,160
really have to go as fast as you can but

3697
03:50:40,160 --> 03:50:41,840
with uh freestyle you've got like an

3698
03:50:41,840 --> 03:50:43,279
hour an hour and a half so you can just

3699
03:50:43,279 --> 03:50:45,760
sort of like play around do some stuff

3700
03:50:45,760 --> 03:50:47,040
it's also low pressure because there's

3701
03:50:47,040 --> 03:50:48,479
no winner right it's just do whatever

3702
03:50:48,479 --> 03:50:50,640
you want and

3703
03:50:50,640 --> 03:50:52,080
you might have some fun like you could

3704
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:53,199
watch what the other people's doing

3705
03:50:53,199 --> 03:50:55,680
maybe uh react to them and to put some

3706
03:50:55,680 --> 03:50:57,199
stuff in your skater excuse me to

3707
03:50:57,199 --> 03:51:00,880
incorrect this has two minutes left

i'm

3709
03:51:03,359 --> 03:51:05,680
mesmerized by these two i'm i think this

3710
03:51:05,680 --> 03:51:07,760
is the best round we had so far on this

3711
03:51:07,760 --> 03:51:10,239
revision it's absolutely loving both

3712
03:51:10,239 --> 03:51:11,359
effects

3713
03:51:11,359 --> 03:51:13,520
i really really love the glow and the

3714
03:51:13,520 --> 03:51:14,479
the

3715
03:51:14,479 --> 03:51:16,560
interesting sort of chromatic aberration

3716
03:51:16,560 --> 03:51:17,680
type effect that we're seeing on

3717

flipping side i don't even know how

3718
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:21,199

3719
03:51:21,199 --> 03:51:24,960
okay oh my gosh

take over make this topical it's all
