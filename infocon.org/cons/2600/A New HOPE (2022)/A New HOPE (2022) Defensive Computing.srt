1
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,639
go for it

2
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,800
okay welcome everybody

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
my name is michael horowitz and this is

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
defensive computing

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
um needless to say everyone who talks

6
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,080
here thinks their topic is important

7
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,680
this is a tweet from

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,640
sam

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680
bone

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,200
who was supposed to be here he's been to

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,960
hope many times unfortunately he got

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
coveted

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,439
the boring things don't get the

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
headlines and defensive computing is

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,840
brutally boring i will warn you in

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,759
advance

17
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,159
but of course i think it's important

18
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,240
this is the website that gave rise to

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,240
this talk has anybody seen it at all

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,680
yeah it's not particularly popular it

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,420
gets about 300 page views a day

22
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,759
[Music]

23
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,439
the slide deck for this talk is

24
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,119
available there if anyone wants to

25
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,759
download it

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
this is me

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
i am a retired computer nerd so for

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,119
those of you techies out there i am your

29
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,200
future

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,119
i am what your future looks like um

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
being retired means i can criticize

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,640
anything and i will because i have no

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
skin in the game and it also means that

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,399
if i praise anything i have no

35
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
relationship to it i am not selling

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,318
anything

37
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,080
i've been focused on defensive computing

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,160
for a long time i've blogged about it

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,640
for one year with cnet and for nine

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,120
years at computer world

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
it's a topic i come to naturally i'm a

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
pessimist and that's really the big

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
requirement

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,680
the website

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,319
the website is intended for non-techies

46
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,280
but i

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
trust me your techies here will not be

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
bored

49
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,879
also i need a lot of feedback from

50
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,680
techies because nobody knows everything

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,519
here's today's topics

52
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,120
we're not going to get through to stuff

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,160
at the end i have 212 slides in 45

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,120
minutes

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
i will be talking very fast and skipping

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
some stuff but again the slide deck if

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,319
you want it

58
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,720
defensivecomputingchecklist.com

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,959
so why am i here

60
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,120
the big reason is that the tech press

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,040
fails non-techies

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
and as a retired person i'm

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,239
feel for the non-techies

64
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,640
the vast majority of the tech press are

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
what i call art history majors

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
and i mean that as not so much as an

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
insult but i mean it as unqualified to

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,840
cover

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,879
technology not that everyone knows

70
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
everything

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
okay here's one example of this

72
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
molly white somewhat famous

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
um big

74
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,840
critic of crypto there was an article

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,799
2022 this year the new york times

76
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,120
she hated the article she hated it so

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,959
much felt that it was absolutely

78
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,799
terrible she got a whole bunch of her

79
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
friends together and look at this

80
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
paragraph by paragraph they rebutted

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
this article in the new york times

82
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,959
basically saying that the reporter had

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,159
no idea what he was talking about

84
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
and that's it's really a shame that the

85
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,239
tech press fails us over and over again

86
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,360
this is an example of mine from 2017

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
this woman is a business reporter for

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,080
nbc and i saw her on the news and she

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
said oh if you install this web browser

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
extension you can save 50 cents every

91
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
time you buy toothpaste it'll find your

92
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,159
great coupons well here's the web

93
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,159
browser extension she suggested that you

94
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,280
install

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
as you can see it can read and change

96
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,079
all your data on all your websites jesus

97
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,120
christ

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
to save 25 cents when you're buying

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
toothpaste

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
really that's what i meant here you

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,800
don't take

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,120
computer advice from a business reporter

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
any more than you would trust me when

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,560
it's time to buy a gold etf

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,479
so there is some rare good news a lot of

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,919
this is bad news here's some good news

107
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,280
this is some drugstore i don't know

108
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
where it is

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
zooming in

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
trying to warn people about gift card

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
scams

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
some good news

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,759
okay if you part of defensive computing

114
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
is privacy

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
if you're seriously into privacy and by

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
that i mean if you're a member of the

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
supreme court and you don't want people

118
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
fire bombing your house

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,240
michael basil is the kind of guy you

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,280
would go to

121
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,600
he has a website he has a podcast he

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
just started a magazine

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
far more into secure privacy than i am

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
this is just a heads up for anyone who

125
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
really cares about privacy

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,440
uh a couple things i do listen to his

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
podcast

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
um i had no idea you could use apple

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,199
devices without an apple id

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,440
um he did a whole podcast about how mac

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
os spies on you and all the domains he

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
uses firewall to block

133
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
professional grade router always

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
connected to a vpn of course none of his

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
clients can use either

136
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
android or ios

137
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,039
he likes graphene os

138
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
he's not really a techie so his vpn

139
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,720
recommendations are

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,400
kind of arguable

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
but just a heads up

142
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
now the flip side of extreme privacy is

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
extreme openness

144
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,479
so why would you put on your phones

145
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,880
your most important information

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
the most private information

147
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
well here you go iphone medical

148
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
emergency

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
i know probably a lot of you are young

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
you'll never have a medical emergency

151
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
for another 40 years

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,120
does anybody do this anybody with an

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,840
iphone have put a major

154
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
medical stuff

155
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
and a very few

156
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
you know if you fall over you're

157
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
unconscious this could be really

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,919
important

159
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
the point is that anyone who gets your

160
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
phone can find this information without

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
knowing any passwords at all

162
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
and of course android has the exact same

163
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,400
thing

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
i have a note to myself that i got to

165
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
put my blood type in there i'm an

166
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
android person

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
so here you're making like if you're

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
married you put your spouse's name and

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,240
phone number there you're making some

170
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,400
information brutally public

171
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
and for many of us is the right thing to

172
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
do

173
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,600
here's another thing the apple lock

174
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
screen

175
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,160
android lock screen this is my phone

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
i will show you well i can't show you

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,199
it's

178
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,000
but does anybody use the android lock

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
screen put a message on the bottom of it

180
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,199
uh

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
where am i here

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,960
i'm timing myself so i don't go over it

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
it says in the very bottom right hand

184
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
corner if found email so and so that

185
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
email address is automatically forward

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
to my wife and to myself

187
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,039
so if i lose my phone i have some chance

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,720
if an honest person finds it that they

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
can email me

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,120
even though they can't unlock the phone

191
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
am i the only person here to do does

192
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
this

193
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
uh one oh it's a big room it's hard for

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,319
me to scan all right there's about five

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
or six people that do it

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,360
always remember

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
and this is what the tech press never

198
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
ever says

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
always remember this is for the

200
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
non-techies i know the techies out there

201
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,840
are going to say you can figure out who

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,599
sent you an email message

203
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
um i have no idea who to how to figure

204
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
out who really sent a text message

205
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
and certainly when you get a phone call

206
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,039
there's no chance in hell to figure out

207
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,360
who's really calling

208
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
i i mean i wanted to plaster this on the

209
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
walls here but

210
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,319
opted not to

211
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,240
um tech press

212
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,479
this looks good

213
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,360
planned parenthood website spies on you

214
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
okay well thank you very much but

215
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
this is what the article is

216
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
this article is things are bad things

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
are bad how about some defensive stuff

218
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
what can we do to prevent nothing

219
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
absolutely nothing

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,039
so

221
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,120
for the non-techies out there there is

222
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,400
black light which is not really

223
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
wrong black light this black light is

224
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,039
from the markup and is a great free tool

225
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,839
that you can use to evaluate a website

226
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,919
and see just how much spying is going on

227
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,000
there

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,240
here's their report for planned

229
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,760
parenthood

230
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
this is miserable

231
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
this is absolutely miserable i mean the

232
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
cia must be jealous of all the spying

233
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
going on in planned parenthood the

234
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,600
brutal details of skip hope.net by the

235
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,399
way got a perfect score from blacklight

236
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,480
all my websites got a perfect score too

237
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
no spying going on at all

238
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,000
um

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
you have no idea who really sent an

240
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,120
email message again i can't

241
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
stress this enough for the non-techies

242
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,160
there's no equivalent of a postmark

243
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,000
but about email the most important thing

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,839
is that it's very easy to forge the from

245
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,399
address of an email message

246
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,640
very easy the other things are of course

247
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
you can play with domain name games in

248
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
the from address we're going to talk if

249
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
we get to it domain names at the very

250
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,279
end

251
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,800
of course the sender's account could be

252
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
hacked and it could be from a business

253
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,160
partner this was a story

254
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,200
a company called 2u was teaching courses

255
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
and they were pretending to be the

256
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
university of oregon they were a

257
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
business partner basically the

258
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,399
university of oregon said it was them

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
and they got a kickback from 2u

260
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
my point here is that people who signed

261
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
up for this they got emails from the

262
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
university of oregon they thought they

263
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,519
were dealing with the university of

264
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
oregon but they weren't they were

265
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
dealing with this 2u company which was

266
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,560
subcontracted out to make the classes

267
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
there's another thing called email

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
thread hijacking i'm not going to go

269
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,079
into it because of time the point is

270
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,399
never please never trust an email

271
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,079
message

272
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,399
gmail the worst thing about gmail

273
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
is it's free

274
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,120
free means there's no tech support

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
those of you who depend on gmail

276
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
one day you could be in a lot of trouble

277
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,279
email is worth paying for i do i pay for

278
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,760
email i'm very very happy that i do

279
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
here's a bunch of providers pro time

280
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
mail

281
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
anyone else have any suggestions for

282
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
ones that aren't on this list

283
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
i use one of them i'm not going to say

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,640
which one

285
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
but yeah i gladly pay and let me tell

286
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,839
you there was one time when my email was

287
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,519
screwed up and i thought i deleted stuff

288
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
and i found out my vendor actually backs

289
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,480
up all my deleted messages for 10 days i

290
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
said i got my money's worth

291
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,519
um gmail 8 billion people use gmail has

292
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,120
any of you ever backed up your gmail

293
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
address book

294
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
no of course not if you go to gmail that

295
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
one person did congratulations right if

296
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
you go to gmail.com and you open a new

297
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,600
tab you go to contacts.google.com and

298
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,680
you can backup your address book nothing

299
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,040
like having

300
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360
having it in your hand

301
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
all too typical another article in the

302
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
tech press

303
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
all these websites submit stuff when

304
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
you're filling in a form before you

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,040
submit it

306
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
okay big deal

307
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
um

308
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,800
usa today it was one of the companies

309
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
mentioned so you type your first name

310
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
you type your last name and while you're

311
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,519
typing your last name they've already

312
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,360
sucked up your first name that's the

313
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,959
point of the article

314
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,120
but again no defense

315
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,399
no defense

316
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,480
chicken little the sky is falling

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
so that particular article actually was

318
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,440
based on a paper and lo and behold that

319
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
paper had some defenses in it but the

320
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,200
defenses didn't make it to the tech

321
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,160
press

322
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
and here was one defense don't use

323
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,519
chrome

324
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,120
are you ever going to see

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,920
our technica say not to use chrome

326
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
probably not

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
here's another thing in the article they

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,959
made they actually named some of the

329
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,720
websites that were doing this nefarious

330
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,839
thing

331
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,600
the article never mentioned any websites

332
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
that were doing this nefarious thing

333
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
and the actual paper listed all these

334
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,880
spy little uh trackers i say spying

335
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,920
tracker websites so if i know

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,519
these are the things

337
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,560
tracking me what can i do about it

338
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
and that's where dns is your best friend

339
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
this is a long topic

340
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
an introduction for the non-techies

341
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,839
every device connected to the internet

342
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,600
has a unique number

343
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,760
these numbers are ip addresses i'm going

344
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
to stick with ipv4 to keep the concept

345
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,600
simple

346
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,519
and this matters because these numbers

347
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,279
are what the world actually uses to

348
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,079
communicate on the internet

349
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
dns is the system that translates names

350
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,279
to numbers

351
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,040
you think you're going to hope.net but

352
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,320
you're not you're going to 184.105.226.

353
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
et cetera et cetera et cetera

354
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
so it's really important

355
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,880
don't take dns from strangers

356
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,480
that's funny but true um the boring

357
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
stuff about dns yeah yeah the

358
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
interesting stuff about dns

359
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,920
um

360
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,600
you know i'm old i'm retired so i don't

361
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
know if jerry seinfeld references still

362
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
go over

363
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,959
um but dns lets you be the master of

364
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,480
your domain

365
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
anyone watch seinfeld in the 90s

366
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,519
if you control dns you really control

367
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,000
everything

368
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,160
but unfortunately dns is changing

369
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
old dns which lives for many many years

370
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,720
and still is around an amazingly well

371
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,079
designed system

372
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
but no security

373
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,959
um so the new dns is secure comes in two

374
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,399
different flavors

375
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
dns over https dns over tls uses

376
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
different ports yada yada

377
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,920
just makes it more complicated when you

378
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
want to take control of dns

379
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,320
why care about new dns all right skip

380
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,279
that

381
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,480
a lot of you are saying well i use

382
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
u-block origin in my web browser i don't

383
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,760
need to worry about dns that's blocking

384
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
all the bad stuff for me

385
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
there's some pros and cons to that you

386
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,399
can read it i don't need to repeat it

387
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,880
what dns are you using right now there

388
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,639
are quite a lot of websites that will

389
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,880
tell you that

390
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
these websites were created by vpn

391
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,760
companies

392
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
you know you'd think android be smart

393
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
enough that if you set a timer you

394
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
wouldn't go to sleep

395
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,480
but no it's not that smart

396
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,680
okay

397
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,839
32 minutes left

398
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,320
um feel free to visit that uh there's a

399
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,639
whole list of vpn companies that provide

400
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,000
what is your dns sort of services

401
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,800
um i think my favorite is dns leak test

402
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
which is from ivpn

403
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
the source of your dns is complicated

404
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,440
very complicated i'm not the world's

405
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
class expert on networking but this is

406
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
what i came up with

407
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
dns could come from the router in

408
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,519
multiple different ways dns can come

409
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,079
from your device operating system level

410
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,399
in multiple different ways and of course

411
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,199
it can come from your web browser that

412
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,279
is a fairly new thing that web browsers

413
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,160
can specify their own dns servers it's

414
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,079
only the new dns

415
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
everyone calls it secure dns or

416
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
encrypted dns

417
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
it's the new one

418
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
um source of dna

419
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,639
yes so you can have two separate web

420
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,880
browsers on your computer and each one

421
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
could be using different

422
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
dns servers for this name resolution for

423
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,839
the translation

424
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,560
i'm a big fan of peplink routers public

425
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
routers can do dns right here and you

426
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,360
see here i've taken a dot applovin.com

427
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,680
and assigned it an ip address of xero

428
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,920
so no device that's on the network

429
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,600
connected to this router is ever going

430
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,160
to be able to load

431
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,800
a.applovin.com

432
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
because the router is actually doing the

433
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
dns

434
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,720
but again that's only old dns new dns

435
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
would bypass this and for those of you

436
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
who are techies this is their host file

437
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,759
but on a land wide basis

438
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,759
uh yeah for those of you who are techies

439
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,240
this is pie hole too

440
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
um in addition peplink routers can

441
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
control dns generically

442
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,279
so a lot of people will type cm instead

443
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
of com and that is globally blocked here

444
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
in this router

445
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,560
cn is china ru is russia so anyone

446
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
connected to this particular router will

447
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,959
never load any web page that ends with

448
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,638
dot ru or dot cn

449
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,920
dns providers i i think all these dns

450
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,000
providers are recently trustworthy

451
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
the list is far from exhaustive

452
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
the worst choice is the default choice

453
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,120
here in this room our default choice is

454
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,600
google and cloudflare

455
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
i've been told

456
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
my favorite is next dns i have a list of

457
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
dns providers on my router security

458
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,880
website

459
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,000
yes anyone who wants to spend a minute

460
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,160
although i'm going to be talking fast

461
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
you can go to dnsleaktest.com and see

462
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,959
who's providing dns here in this room

463
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,119
the

464
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,599
nlc which is network operation center

465
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,919
they've done a little test for us

466
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
here in this room you can get to yahoo

467
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,359
you can get to news.yahoo you can get to

468
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,760
everything at yahoo except

469
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,599
yahoo sports

470
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,280
they have blocked yahoo sports if you

471
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,599
try to bring up sports.yahoo.com in this

472
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,280
room now

473
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
you should be blocked

474
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
however

475
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,200
that's an old dns system

476
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
you can specify in your web browsers

477
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,799
that you want to use new secure dns

478
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,480
and if you do that

479
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
that should bypass whatever fudging is

480
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,678
going on in the router

481
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,960
next dns my preferred provider i think

482
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
is a great service it's a free service

483
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,120
up to a point 20 bucks a year they block

484
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,640
ads and trackers by default

485
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,280
extremely customizable

486
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
you also get multiple profiles

487
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,080
so you can assign one profile to each

488
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,919
one of your different devices

489
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,000
or if you have three devices they can

490
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,679
have two of them can have one profile

491
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,600
one can have another if you have two web

492
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
browsers on your computer one web

493
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
browser can use one dnx profile another

494
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,880
can use a different profile

495
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,919
next dns integrates with everything in

496
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,760
the world as you have to when you're

497
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,240
doing dns android ios windows et cetera

498
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
it starts off with two block lists

499
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,520
of bad stuff bad stuff being ads and

500
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
trackers you can adjust the block list

501
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
that next dns uses

502
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,360
you can also control websites you see

503
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,039
here facebook it says remove that's

504
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,720
cause facebook is blocked at the time i

505
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
made this screenshot

506
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,880
i don't even know what 9g ag is but you

507
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,559
have another level of blocking

508
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,160
customization

509
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,039
and you have a deny list so no matter

510
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,600
what the other lists are doing specific

511
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,160
websites you don't want to load you can

512
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,880
just set them up to deny

513
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
um

514
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,679
which one you see here ctld windows

515
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
update yeah trying on windows update on

516
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
the computer connected to this thing

517
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,679
you're not going to get it unblocked

518
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,080
windows update they also have an allow

519
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,640
list for times when you're locking bad

520
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,039
things but it blocks too much so you can

521
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,200
make exceptions allow list and block

522
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
list totally customizable of course they

523
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,679
have stats my favorite one here

524
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,120
graph.facebook.com shove it facebook

525
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,720
right you're not getting in

526
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
no not when i'm using nextdns

527
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,200
if you're not sure what to block

528
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
next dns has logs

529
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
optional you can turn them on or off you

530
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,640
can retain them for a day for a week

531
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,679
whatever

532
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,160
and you see here this was a lot this is

533
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
my phone

534
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,559
geez android you'd think you'd say awake

535
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,600
it allowed it to go to api.lyft.com

536
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,960
but because the red line on the

537
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
left-hand side it blocked it from going

538
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,200
to app.measurement.com

539
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,120
and despite that block lyft still works

540
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,679
secure dns on android android wins when

541
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,679
it comes to operating systems if you

542
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
want to do secure dns android is the

543
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,679
best there is one setting in android

544
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,200
system wide

545
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
and that's it

546
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,280
that's it the whole system uses that

547
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,559
secure dns setting

548
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
here's how to configure

549
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
a chromebook

550
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
the other google system chromebook also

551
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
has a single system-wide setting for

552
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
secure dns

553
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,360
that applies if you have a chromebook

554
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
that's shared by multiple people they

555
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,840
all get that one system-wide setting so

556
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,919
google wins here hands down

557
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,559
secure dns on ios is a brutal mess i'm

558
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,480
not even going to talk about it

559
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,400
i'm not an ios developer but i believe

560
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,799
each app on ios can use their own dns

561
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,360
secure dns in a web browser this is how

562
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,159
you

563
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,400
set it now in the old days it used to be

564
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
different you used to have to provide a

565
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,440
parameter when you started the thing up

566
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,400
but now it's built into the browsers

567
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,960
uh secure dns in my router

568
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
and again here we have arm wrestling

569
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
going on

570
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,000
this next dns will be used if you're not

571
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
doing anything else

572
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,559
but if you're connected to this bra this

573
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
router and your web browser is

574
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,840
configured to use a different secure dns

575
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
the web browser dns wins and that's

576
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,960
what's going on and if you have a system

577
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,320
that's connected to a vpn

578
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
that wins too

579
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,919
so this looks like it's system-wide it's

580
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,200
not really system-wide it's very

581
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,559
complicated

582
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,320
dns can come from the router can some

583
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,840
from your operating system can come from

584
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
your web browser

585
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,159
dns is your friend

586
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,240
this was a recent story about routers

587
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,880
that were being hacked with malware

588
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,360
and notice here that the malware

589
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,480
attempted

590
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
to gather the public ip address by

591
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,960
contacting these four websites

592
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
well if you're in control of dns you can

593
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
block those four websites and guess what

594
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,799
if it couldn't get an ip address the

595
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,720
malware would delete itself

596
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
dns is your friend

597
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
and this is just sad

598
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,039
this why i'm here to kind of correct

599
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,720
this sort of stuff

600
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,799
there is a dns blocking tester a lot of

601
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,280
these dns companies

602
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,000
try to block ads and trackers this is a

603
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,120
free test how well they're doing

604
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,720
this is proton vpn on ios has something

605
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,159
called net shield

606
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,760
you can turn that shield on or off you

607
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
can tell just to block malware or you

608
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,919
want to block malware ads and trackers

609
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,120
and

610
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,240
proton vpn got a score of 77 not the

611
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
best

612
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,679
don't need that

613
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,640
here's another vpn provider winscribe

614
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,760
their dns system is called robert

615
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,480
it's very much like next dns but it only

616
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,080
applies when you're connected to their

617
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,200
vpn

618
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,159
and you see they got 100 very good

619
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,640
the eff also has a blocking tester if

620
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
you're using dns to block ads and

621
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
trackers

622
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
they don't call it that but if you see

623
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
there on the bottom it does show you if

624
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,320
you're blocking ads and trackers

625
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,559
another dns is your friend

626
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,799
facebook receiving sensitive i mean if

627
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
you ever use the my chart system i think

628
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,240
that's what it's about a number of the

629
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
big hospitals here in new york city use

630
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
my chart

631
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,960
and they integrate with facebook and

632
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
facebook spies on what you're doing in

633
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,600
the my chart system

634
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,440
so to the point of this article was that

635
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
the facebook pixel was bad

636
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,919
bad bad bad bad bad

637
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,760
but the facebook pixel is

638
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
connect.facebook.net

639
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,480
and if you're in charge of dns you can

640
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,679
block that

641
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,039
and you don't have to worry about the

642
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,960
facebook pixel

643
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,400
the sky is not falling

644
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,200
another article in the tech press

645
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,039
i tried to email this guy to tell him

646
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,200
that you can block facebook but no

647
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
response

648
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,080
okay

649
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
chromebooks

650
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,360
a chromebook cheat sheet

651
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,200
i don't have to read everything here i'm

652
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
i'm tight on time chromebooks are the

653
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,080
greatest thing since sliced bread

654
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,360
i say that because i'm retired

655
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,880
chromebooks put a lot of nerds out of

656
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,559
business because they just work they

657
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,200
don't need care and feeding

658
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
why do i bring up chromebooks no viruses

659
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,960
no malware

660
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,520
no karen feeding so for non-technical

661
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,440
people it's the greatest thing since

662
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
sliced bird

663
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
it's the chrome os is the newest system

664
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
it defends itself better than the older

665
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
systems and old says i mean windows

666
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,159
linux and mac os these are ancient

667
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,279
systems these were designed 30 years ago

668
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,039
i mean i've been in the field 40 years

669
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
and i call these things ancient

670
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,360
um chromebook all files are encrypted

671
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,559
all the time

672
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,880
erasing files off an ssd

673
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
really difficult thing to do on these

674
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,799
ancient desktop operating systems

675
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
nothing on chromebook all files

676
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
encrypted all the time you delete your

677
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,919
gmail account everything's gone never be

678
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,679
recovered you can power wash a

679
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
chromebook everything's gone never be

680
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,520
recovered it's the best way if you have

681
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,679
sensitive files on an ssd

682
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,520
it's your friend

683
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,400
um full chrome browser

684
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
not the limited chrome you get on the

685
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,360
mobile operating systems

686
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,559
um

687
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,240
nice thing about chromebooks it gets

688
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,400
three personalities you can use just the

689
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,679
chrome web browser if you're a

690
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,039
non-techie my family does this

691
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,320
but if you're a little more techy you

692
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,080
can install android apps and if you're

693
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
brutally techy you can install linux

694
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
apps too so it adjusts to the technical

695
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,320
level of the user

696
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,559
um very sophisticated thing

697
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
chrome os two copies of the operating

698
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
system this is a big reason there's no

699
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,919
care and feeding

700
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,679
this is something of course mac os will

701
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
never get microsource couldn't even

702
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,440
spell it

703
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
so the system in the background updates

704
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
the copy of the operating system you are

705
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,080
not using

706
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,360
and the next time the computer is

707
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,279
rebooted you run the new copy of the

708
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,880
operating system

709
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,039
it's the only way to fly

710
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,279
um anyone here know of any other systems

711
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,919
or software that worked this way

712
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,559
go ahead what

713
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
say it again

714
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
solaris

715
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
all right i'm not familiar with it uh by

716
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,640
the way the chrome web browser i believe

717
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,279
works this way

718
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,080
i'm sorry i can't hear you

719
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,400
us old people are hearing goes i apolo

720
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,760
and you're wearing a mask so we have two

721
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
strikes against this

722
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,520
but this is a big reason

723
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,480
um i'm a fan of peplink routers

724
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
peblic routers do the exact same thing

725
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,600
they have two copies of the firmware

726
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
so you're running version seven you

727
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
wanna try out version eight for a day or

728
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,919
two

729
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,679
boot to version eight you're not sure

730
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,919
yet you boot back to version seven it's

731
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,279
the only way to fly it's the most

732
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,440
sophisticated thing out there and you'll

733
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,279
never see this on any other operating

734
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,390
systems at least not yet

735
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,760
[Music]

736
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,440
the one the one danger in a chromebook

737
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
of course is you can be scammed to

738
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,440
install a browser extension

739
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,159
such as that honey browser extension

740
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,240
that is the one flaw in a chromebook

741
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,720
ointment

742
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,880
oh and chromebooks tend to be cheap this

743
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
was from a week or two ago it's not the

744
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
best chromebook in the world but for 79

745
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,679
dollars geez

746
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,320
um oh and chrome os flex is just out of

747
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,279
beta

748
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,360
you can just like this is google

749
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,919
stealing from linux you can install a

750
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,880
version of chrome os on a usb flash

751
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,840
drive

752
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,799
and take a desktop computer even in mac

753
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,520
computer and boot it to that flash drive

754
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,120
and you can run

755
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,039
chrome os it's a cut down version of

756
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,960
chrome os it only has the chrome web

757
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,279
browser it does not do linux does not do

758
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,640
android

759
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
but it's a great way to take an old

760
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,559
computer and make it relevant

761
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,200
ah and let's talk guest mode

762
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,000
chrome os has a guest mode

763
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,480
guest mode is a great thing

764
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,960
like incognito in a web browser it saves

765
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,039
no browsing history but guest mode is at

766
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,080
the operating system level

767
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,320
um yes you can think of it as incognito

768
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,919
mode on steroids

769
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,360
when you enter guest mode on a

770
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,799
chromebook it's you start off with a

771
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,399
clean slate

772
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,000
you have no bookmarks you have no

773
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
extensions there's no browser history

774
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,640
there's no android apps there's no link

775
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,399
to google drive there's no safe that you

776
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,480
have a clean slate

777
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,720
while you're in guest mode you can't

778
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
even make a bookmark you can't install

779
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,799
an extension the only thing you can do

780
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,240
in guest mark is you can read and write

781
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,279
to a usb flash drive

782
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,039
and of course if you log into a website

783
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,039
they know who you are when you exit

784
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,559
guest mode everything is thrown away

785
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,919
everything is thrown away that's why i

786
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,840
mentioned the usb flash drive if you

787
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,520
want to save something you have to save

788
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,879
it to a usb flash drive

789
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,120
apple is soon going to release lockdown

790
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,640
mode for ios

791
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,320
the great thing about lockdown mode is

792
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,799
they've taken out some features

793
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,240
okay

794
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
guest mode on a chromebook goes far far

795
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,760
farther than lockdown mode

796
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,799
so guest mode is great to let a child

797
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,080
use a chromebook there's nothing they

798
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,240
can do they can't screw it up guest mode

799
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,760
on a chromebook the safest way to use

800
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,000
facebook there's very little spying they

801
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,240
can do on you tick tock goes just in the

802
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,919
news for being spying on everything on a

803
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,399
mobile operating system so okay do it in

804
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,919
a guest mode on a chromebook and

805
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,120
and

806
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,440
for hope

807
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,000
whistleblowers

808
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
if you're a whistleblower a chromebook

809
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,760
in guest mode is your best friend

810
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,279
there's nothing to be had if your

811
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,320
chromebook is seized by the government

812
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,279
whistleblowers i suggest use protonmail

813
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,799
webmail

814
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,480
but you do it in a guest mode it leaves

815
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
no traces behind

816
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,559
i think protonmail for non-techies

817
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,080
whistleblowers

818
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,559
is far far better than signal wicker

819
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,559
wire all that sort of junk

820
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,159
much much easier to use much more

821
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,480
approachable for non-techies it's just

822
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,039
webmail

823
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,320
it's free it's anonymous right you can

824
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,639
open pro 10 mail accounts anonymously

825
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,320
it it always annoys me that no news

826
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
outlets say oh you have a tip for us

827
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
send it via this and then nobody

828
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,840
supports protonmail

829
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,399
it's i don't know why that is

830
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,000
um

831
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,320
protonmail messages between two

832
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,919
protonmail users are encrypted

833
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,320
simple easy you couldn't get any simpler

834
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,039
easier freer or more anonymous but

835
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,799
exactly what's going on when you send

836
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,840
between from and to a proton mail user

837
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,440
the world can see the from address the

838
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,760
world can see the two address the from

839
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
address not a big deal you can open an

840
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,440
account anonymously the world can see

841
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,360
the subject line and the world can see

842
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,799
the name of any attached files

843
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,799
but the body of the message and the

844
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,960
actual attached files no one can see

845
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,200
that even protonmails they can't see

846
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,720
that

847
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,080
i love this picture by the way the

848
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,000
whistleblower with their dart on their

849
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,120
back

850
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,480
um

851
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,840
okay what is the first thing you should

852
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
do with a new usb flash drive

853
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,880
yes that's the second thing

854
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,360
say it again

855
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,880
you know between the mask and you're

856
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
hearing like i'm sorry

857
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,200
stick it in the chromebook in guest mode

858
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
that is the only safe thing to do with

859
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,559
the usb flash drive

860
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,960
and yes then format it

861
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,399
okay quick takes

862
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,080
that was a couple long topics now we've

863
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,679
got a real quick

864
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,320
the lightning round so to speak again

865
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,080
i can't repeat this enough for those of

866
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,199
you who are non-techies

867
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,159
framework laptops if anyone's buying a

868
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,000
laptop nice thing about framework is

869
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
they're modular

870
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,760
if you're interested in privacy

871
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,519
there's a little switch on the framework

872
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,519
laptop if you turn the camera off it's

873
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,399
off

874
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,039
it's off off off hardware wise off and

875
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,559
the same thing for the microphone in a

876
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,880
frame book so little switch on the top

877
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,600
turns them off off off

878
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
you don't have enough usb ports you can

879
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,919
take the usb ports in and out it's not

880
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,919
cheap i just mentioned it because if

881
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,440
you're buying uh i've heard very good

882
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,360
things about it this particular review

883
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
is from a trusted source

884
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,200
source it's an extremely long review

885
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,039
the only bad thing about it it only

886
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,200
seems to support windows 11

887
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,240
support for windows 10 kind of iffy but

888
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,840
if you're a linux person they definitely

889
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,600
support three different linux distros

890
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,519
if you're doing a google search it's

891
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,080
certainly best not to be logged in

892
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,679
you see here on the top when you're not

893
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,120
logged into google there's a blue thing

894
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,399
that says sign in

895
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,080
and when you are logged into google on

896
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,760
the bottom you see your first initial in

897
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,960
a circle

898
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,039
so yeah google can't spy on you if they

899
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,880
don't know who you are

900
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
and they really don't like that

901
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,159
please please sign in please please

902
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,919
the point about this article is iphones

903
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,640
even when they're off they're not off

904
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,279
um i think the article detailed two

905
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,559
separate wireless systems or maybe three

906
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,240
that are still running even when an

907
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,840
iphone is off

908
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,679
certainly bluetooth i forget what the

909
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,080
other one or two are

910
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,600
but if you turn an iphone off and you

911
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,279
don't want to be tracked you certainly

912
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,960
want to disable the find by feature

913
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,120
amazon

914
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,039
if you got a phone call from amazon is

915
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,200
it a scam

916
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,000
it turns out amazon does call people

917
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,279
i was very surprised i learned this

918
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,440
about a month ago i was really shocked

919
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
just so you know

920
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,960
um and if you see something on amanda on

921
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
amazon that says its choice the only

922
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,639
thing that means is that it's in stock

923
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,399
for non-techies a lot of it people will

924
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,719
say hover the mouse over a link and

925
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,320
you'll see on the bottom where the link

926
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,639
goes that's a scam

927
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,359
yeah i'm no coding expert on this stuff

928
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,399
but

929
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,399
in this example it does not go to some

930
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,239
goodplace.com

931
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,480
i blog in this particular blog two or

932
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,199
three separate ways that that can be

933
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560
made to go somewhere you don't think

934
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,719
it's going so for non-techies just

935
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,639
realize that's useless hovering the

936
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,719
mouse over the link does not tell you

937
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,040
where you're going

938
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,719
um if you have a short link and you want

939
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,320
to know where it's going there are a

940
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,918
number of websites that will expand the

941
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,638
link for you

942
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,000
i'm being safe on public wi-fi

943
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,280
like in this very room

944
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,200
a couple dull and boring things of

945
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,520
course you never do your banking on it

946
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,760
of course if you're on an iphone turn

947
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
off airdrop

948
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,440
don't ever use windows if you've ever

949
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
evaluated the firewall in windows it's

950
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,480
like swiss cheese

951
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,400
some interesting things though

952
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,839
um evil twin networks if i was a bad guy

953
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,359
i'd make

954
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,560
what's the network here something secure

955
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
hope secure you know there's nothing to

956
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,520
stop

957
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,960
someone here with a little technical

958
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
studio for making their own hope secure

959
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,839
network and you'd log on to that as far

960
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,440
as i know there's really no defense

961
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,079
against that

962
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
of course you're on ios recent thing in

963
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
ios is it tells you which apps are

964
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,200
allowed to scan the local network

965
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,280
i forget if that was version 14 or 15

966
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,839
that came in

967
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,440
use a chromebook on a public wi-fi

968
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,040
and of course when you're done tell the

969
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,720
devices to forget the network so you

970
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,240
know but here's the good stuff

971
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,880
all discussions about vpns focus on the

972
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,400
internet

973
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,119
fully on the internet the lan is a very

974
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,480
dangerous place

975
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,880
this picture here is actually from hope

976
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
at the uh hotel

977
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,359
and big question is do you trust all

978
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,200
those people because you're sharing a

979
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,520
network with all those people

980
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
there's an attribute of a wi-fi network

981
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,720
known as layer level two isolation

982
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,800
or is it layer 2 isolation i think i

983
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
made a typo

984
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,520
uh it's layer 2 sorry

985
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,920
what this controls is whether you all

986
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
can see each other

987
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,240
if you scan the local network are you

988
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,079
you going to see his computer and you

989
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,760
see his computer

990
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,480
um i tested this a little while ago and

991
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,119
it is not being used here

992
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,040
so if you're connected to this network

993
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,359
realize that all these bad guys who are

994
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,760
sharing the network with you

995
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
i saw this at lincoln center

996
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,359
a few years ago i spoke at some other

997
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,119
conference and they didn't have it

998
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,280
enabled so you have to take this upon

999
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,760
yourself to protect the land side

1000
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
and it turns out that a small number of

1001
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,880
vpns actually have this option

1002
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,119
uh if you're using movad this is moved

1003
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,400
on windows you see local network sharing

1004
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,079
turn it on or off

1005
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
i actually tested that one it works very

1006
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,240
well

1007
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,599
ivpn has it on a multiple operating

1008
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,520
systems

1009
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,040
that we call they give it different

1010
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
names it's kind of annoying

1011
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
um winscribe has it they call it allow

1012
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,440
land traffic i'm not 100 sure it works

1013
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,240
on winscribe but again it's not just you

1014
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,359
have to test the software you have to

1015
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,800
test it on whatever operating system

1016
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
you're using

1017
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,880
ovpn supports a proton vcn supports it

1018
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,359
at least on some operating systems

1019
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,200
um but if you're going to be on public

1020
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,960
wi-fi it's certainly something you want

1021
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,800
from your vpn

1022
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
and the other safe way to be on public

1023
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,280
wi-fi is to use a travel router

1024
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
in this case the router connects to the

1025
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,880
public wi-fi networks and you connect to

1026
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,720
the router

1027
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,560
the outside world all they see is the

1028
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,160
router

1029
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,560
they never see you at all

1030
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,400
in this picture this is from a company

1031
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,880
called glinet i've never used one of

1032
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,000
their routers

1033
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,839
they sell a lot of very small travel

1034
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,320
routers

1035
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,839
um

1036
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,520
oh

1037
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,560
is anybody doing this here

1038
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,640
no not enough defensive thinking here

1039
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,920
all right this is what it looks like in

1040
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
a peplink router they call the feature

1041
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
wi-fi is wan

1042
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,079
and you can tell the router to connect

1043
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,960
to the local wi-fi

1044
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,280
okay quick takes two how am i doing

1045
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,720
uh

1046
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,240
seven minutes

1047
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,400
all right this is slide number 113 i got

1048
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,560
200.

1049
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,280
okay um ios settings no you don't need

1050
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,040
that from me that's everywhere tick tock

1051
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,640
no big deal just use a chromebook in

1052
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,839
guest mode

1053
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,359
microsoft don't use windows you don't

1054
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,960
need me to tell you that

1055
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,280
office software libra office versus

1056
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,520
microsoft office it's hard to make a

1057
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,119
case for microsoft office um

1058
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,560
this presentation was done with

1059
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,800
libreoffice

1060
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
oh yeah and did i mention when you get a

1061
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,680
phone call you never know who's calling

1062
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,480
i cannot repeat this enough only because

1063
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,839
nobody else says this

1064
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
router security i spoke on router

1065
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,960
security at hope 2014.

1066
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,599
three classes of routers the worst class

1067
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,520
is whatever your isp gives you because

1068
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,960
they really don't care about security at

1069
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,359
all then if you go to best buy and buy

1070
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
something from netgear okay it's a step

1071
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,480
up

1072
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,320
but the real step up is a business or

1073
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,839
professional router

1074
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,760
that's what i recommend

1075
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,839
these are all the fancy features i don't

1076
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,599
have time to read them that you'll get

1077
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,599
in a higher end router

1078
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,320
the big thing is outbound firewall rules

1079
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,920
this was from a recent conference

1080
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,319
besides in knoxville and the guy was

1081
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,920
saying about all these printers got

1082
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,119
hacked

1083
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,040
well you know if your router does

1084
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,359
outbound firewall rules

1085
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,119
you can make a rule that says the

1086
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,280
printer can never phone home

1087
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,440
so the printer does get hacked so what

1088
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,200
it's a very big deal having outbound

1089
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,720
firewall rules

1090
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,880
router tips rebooted every now and then

1091
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,040
there is some router malware that gets

1092
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,240
installed

1093
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,720
but cannot survive a reboot

1094
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,319
it can't hurt every now and then

1095
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,520
um

1096
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,839
oh

1097
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,520
this really the best routers look at

1098
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,319
this

1099
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,760
security we don't need no stinking

1100
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,319
security this is how we judge

1101
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,079
all we care about is speed and range

1102
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,839
meanwhile on my website i've got like 30

1103
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,160
different security features to look for

1104
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,920
but the wire cutter they can't be

1105
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,960
bothered with any of them

1106
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,920
um

1107
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,839
a big thing in evaluating a router is

1108
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,119
whether you need an account with the

1109
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,640
hardware vendor

1110
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,240
if you don't need an account that's a

1111
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,359
good thing

1112
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,359
is the router spying on you

1113
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,200
a lot of them do we'll see an article

1114
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,880
here in a second

1115
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,400
two companies that i recommend they

1116
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,640
definitely do not spy on you i verify

1117
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,000
that

1118
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,839
self-updating

1119
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,040
self-help i think is great for

1120
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,280
non-techies certainly techies don't need

1121
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
it this is really interesting about

1122
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,119
router spying on you

1123
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,520
i like the quote about euro if you have

1124
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,200
an error router the only way it's not

1125
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,880
going to spy on you is if you turn it

1126
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,119
off

1127
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
and even though this guy was running for

1128
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,880
cnet he couldn't get d-link to give him

1129
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,560
the time of day

1130
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,920
i think that tells you everything you

1131
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
need to know about d-link

1132
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,920
peplink routers i'm a big fan but in the

1133
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,839
time i will skip it

1134
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,560
pcwrt router um

1135
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,119
highly recommended it's 130 bucks

1136
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,280
what's great about it is for that 130

1137
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
dollars you get vlans

1138
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,160
which

1139
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,520
i'm running late so i'm not going to

1140
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,319
explain vlans you get vlans and vpn

1141
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,240
support

1142
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,480
vpn support includes wireguard and

1143
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,079
openvpn and ike version 2.

1144
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,400
firmware updates are free forever

1145
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,800
for 130 bucks i would think this is a

1146
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,359
great thing for dedicated for vpn use

1147
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,200
you've got your main router fine hook

1148
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,680
this one up use the vpn connection in

1149
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,919
that

1150
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,920
all right skip for time

1151
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,599
skip for time passwords

1152
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,040
how am i doing on time

1153
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,760
three minutes

1154
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,560
okay

1155
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,119
there are these are the five i wrote a

1156
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,960
long blog about passwords so that's the

1157
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,319
url there

1158
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,760
five separate ways for dealing with

1159
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,520
passwords i think these are probably the

1160
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,280
five most common

1161
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,880
um every approach to dealing with

1162
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,359
passwords has its pros and cons

1163
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,119
so anyone who gives you a suggestion

1164
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,880
this is what you should do

1165
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,800
and doesn't mention the downside of

1166
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,560
their favorite approach

1167
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,920
you're dealing with a religious zealot

1168
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,160
even for a single person chances are

1169
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,839
that multiple password approaches are

1170
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,079
the right thing to do

1171
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,920
your most important passwords i would

1172
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
argue don't belong in any computer ever

1173
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,079
anywhere

1174
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,200
and what are your most important

1175
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
passwords the obvious ones being email

1176
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,399
financial and apple id

1177
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,520
password manager software

1178
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
my blog i have 20 reasons why i don't

1179
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
like password manager software i don't

1180
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,359
have time to get into it i'll just leave

1181
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,640
it at foui

1182
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,680
and i'm going to suggest a formula

1183
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,160
someone in this very space last night

1184
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,640
said don't use password formulas but he

1185
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,560
was suggesting a hard formula

1186
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,319
a hard formula is you give it an input

1187
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,000
you know exactly what the output is

1188
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,839
that's not what i'm suggesting here at

1189
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,640
all

1190
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,119
um so for formulas the

1191
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,560
soft formulas that i'm suggesting

1192
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
is that you treat the password as two

1193
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,240
separate halves

1194
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,480
that there's a fixed portion

1195
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,720
and a variable portion

1196
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,480
the fixed portion if you use it over and

1197
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,520
over and over you're never going to

1198
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,720
forget it

1199
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,240
and the variable

1200
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,079
variable portion can be something that's

1201
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,800
for you very easy to remember

1202
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,960
a simple example i own a whole bunch of

1203
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
thinkpad laptops they all have different

1204
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,240
passwords

1205
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,359
they all start with tulips

1206
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,280
and then i have a model number

1207
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,760
so if i woke up to my t480 thinkpad i

1208
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,839
know it's tulips t480

1209
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,000
very simple little formula of course

1210
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,480
it's only for a few

1211
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,200
here's a if you're a new york yankee fan

1212
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,119
consider putting babe ruth at both ends

1213
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,640
of your password and then just have a

1214
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,720
variable thing in the middle

1215
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,280
um if you're in the u.s and you pay your

1216
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,040
taxes to the irs

1217
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,040
and the word bleeding comes to you when

1218
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,119
you think of the irs

1219
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,200
there's your password bay bleeding roof

1220
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,800
you'll never forget the babe ruth park

1221
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,240
that'll be burned into your brain very

1222
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,440
very quickly

1223
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,359
um think of amazon you think of jungle

1224
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,520
there's your password babe jungleworth

1225
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,760
no this is a pretty long password

1226
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,319
uh and pretty easy to remember and you

1227
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,319
can even write down you say my irs

1228
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,480
password is bleeding and even if someone

1229
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,680
sees that they won't know what your

1230
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,040
password is

1231
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,400
because they don't know that babe is in

1232
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,920
the beginning and ruth is at the end

1233
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,760
okay more quick takes

1234
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,000
um

1235
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,200
i have one minute left

1236
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,079
um these companies can five five minutes

1237
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,640
if there's no time for q a so yeah i'll

1238
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,680
have no time for crap i'll take

1239
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,119
questions afterwards i can be here for

1240
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,839
another six hours five minutes um these

1241
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,160
companies can read your files and these

1242
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,040
companies can't

1243
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,720
um i mentioned backblaze they're a major

1244
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,480
player

1245
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,400
the complicated thing the thing with

1246
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,160
major players is they get complicated

1247
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,720
backblaze does support not being able to

1248
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,960
read your files but they use multiple

1249
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,760
terms for it

1250
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,040
cookies cookies are annoying because

1251
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,480
when people talk about cookies i never

1252
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,119
know what they're talking about

1253
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,200
cookies are one way that websites can

1254
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,760
store a file on your computer

1255
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,560
fine but there's also

1256
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,680
other ways

1257
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,160
there's also local storage

1258
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,000
file system cache storage database

1259
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
storage so when someone says cookies are

1260
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,400
they only talking about cookies are they

1261
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,720
also talking about file system storage

1262
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,319
and cash storage and all these other

1263
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,200
types

1264
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,359
i never know and chances are when people

1265
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:30,480
are talking about cookies they don't

1266
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,599
know either

1267
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,119
oh and by the way

1268
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,720
when you get a text message you never

1269
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,800
know who sent it

1270
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,200
um a second phone number

1271
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,400
this is something i've done i've been

1272
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,880
very happy with it

1273
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,240
i have a second phone number with a

1274
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,839
company called text now i pay three

1275
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,640
dollars a month for it it's a wi-fi only

1276
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,000
phone number

1277
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,480
so it's also an app so i can sort on

1278
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,560
multiple devices if i lose one device

1279
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,040
it's no big deal and if that device is

1280
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,760
offline i'm not getting any phone calls

1281
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,280
and if i do get a phone call when the

1282
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,680
device is offline they take a message

1283
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,520
and then they email me that like

1284
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,200
something's waiting for me i mean they

1285
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,000
take a voice message an actual recording

1286
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,160
um the eff suggested a couple other

1287
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,599
companies

1288
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,440
i've been happy with text now i'm not

1289
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,800
suggesting it's the greatest thing in

1290
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,839
the world but having having a second

1291
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,160
sacrificial lamb phone number

1292
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,920
uh i've been very happy with it it's

1293
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,839
like three days after i got this i went

1294
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,599
to some museum in the wintertime and i

1295
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,520
had to check my code and to check my

1296
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
code they wanted my phone number and i

1297
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,599
said i made the right decision

1298
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,920
because i had a sacrificial phone number

1299
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,119
to give them

1300
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,680
vpns is a big topic

1301
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,559
i've got a couple minutes

1302
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
vpns provide three things

1303
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,960
um

1304
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,280
these are the three things

1305
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,839
uh do you need a vpn

1306
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,359
okay

1307
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,839
the big thing about vpns i will skip to

1308
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,440
because i'm only down to a couple

1309
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,760
minutes

1310
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,400
vpn's on ios

1311
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,720
vpns and ios if you look at this screen

1312
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,240
you'll see that two places it says

1313
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,079
you're connected to a vpn in two places

1314
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,280
you're not

1315
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,280
who the hell who the hell came up with

1316
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,400
this

1317
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,800
really

1318
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
um stephen wright probably my favorite

1319
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,200
joke in the world i had to get a new

1320
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,720
shadow the old one wasn't doing what i

1321
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,800
was doing

1322
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,359
um and i mentioned that because is your

1323
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,480
vpn doing what it's supposed to be doing

1324
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,119
i recently looked at a vpn to see if it

1325
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,119
was doing what i was doing

1326
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,960
which meant every is everything in the

1327
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,319
tunnel

1328
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,319
and lo and behold and this was on an

1329
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,839
ipad

1330
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,520
lo and behold i found that everything

1331
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,160
was not going through the tunnel

1332
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,119
this was ios 15.5 which i believe is the

1333
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,800
latest version

1334
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,680
um

1335
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,240
it's buggy ios is buggy when it comes to

1336
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,520

1337
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,119

1338
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,720
proton vpn in march 2020

1339
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,880
they wrote this article about vpns

1340
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,160
leaking

1341
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,559
and you know march 2020

1342
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,440
coronavirus they kind of dropped it

1343
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
they reported it to apple apple kind of

1344
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,839
dropped it too it never got fixed

1345
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,720
so vpns on ios i've blogged about it

1346
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,720
here if you want the glory details

1347
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,359
i've actually been in contact with apple

1348
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,359
and whether they've tried to recreate it

1349
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,880
none of my business

1350
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
is there did they admit it's a bug none

1351
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,200
of your business will they ever fix it

1352
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,280
none of your business

1353
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,559
if you're using ios don't trust the vpn

1354
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,680
at all

1355
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,079
it is buggy

1356
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,079
and

1357
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,440
oh double vpns

1358
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,960
um

1359
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,280
quick thing about it uh double vpn means

1360
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,040
running two vpns at the same time on

1361
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,559
your computer

1362
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,640
you start out with a normal vpn which is

1363
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,680
at the operating system level

1364
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,559
except on ios where it doesn't work

1365
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,480
and then you can add a vpn that runs as

1366
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,880
an extension in your web browser

1367
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,960
this is offered by tunnelbear offered by

1368
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,040
winscribe

1369
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,440
the opera desktop browser has vpn built

1370
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,359
into the browser itself

1371
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,680
the edge browser will soon have a vpn

1372
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,240
built into the browser itself

1373
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,319
um and of course the browser vpn

1374
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,079
provider should be different from the

1375
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,880
operator this is really cool

1376
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,000
um

1377
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,599
so your isp

1378
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,000
if you're running a vpn inside a vpn so

1379
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,160
you have an operating system level vpn

1380
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,720
and a browser level vpn

1381
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,880
your isp only sees the operating system

1382
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,599
vpn they can't see inside it

1383
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,800
the company that's running your

1384
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,119
operating system vpn can see that you

1385
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,160
connect it to the vpn in your browser

1386
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,400
but that's all they can see

1387
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,920
the company that's running the browser

1388
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,280
vpn

1389
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,960
well they can see what you're doing

1390
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,640
right any vpn provider if they're

1391
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,319
corrupt they can see what you're doing

1392
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,079
but that browser vpn provider doesn't

1393
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,280
know who you are

1394
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,960
they know you're a customer of the

1395
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
operating system vpn that's all they

1396
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,280
know about you

1397
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,599
