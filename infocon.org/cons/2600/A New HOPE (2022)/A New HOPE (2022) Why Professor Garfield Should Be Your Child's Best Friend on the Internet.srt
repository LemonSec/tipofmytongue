1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,880
we're getting another couple minutes and

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,080
then we'll get started just to give

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,359
people a chance to get down from

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,359
upstairs

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
well this looks like that's about all

6
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
we're going to get so let's

7
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,600
give it a start

8
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,560
basically

9
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
how did i get involved with garfield the

10
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
cat

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,560
i'm a big bad hacker dude

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
well i lived in titusville florida

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
bedroom community to the kennedy space

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
center and cape canaveral spaceport

15
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,119
station

16
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
and a fifth grade teacher

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
gave the web address of my zen cheshire

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
catalyst dot com website to his fifth

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,960
grade class

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
i got some fan mail

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,479
well

22
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
big bad hacker dude does not want to be

23
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
a role model to fifth grade students

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
so i couldn't fix this i had to find

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
somebody who could

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
and that's when i found professor

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,479
garfield

28
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,440
now apparently

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
if you put glasses on something or

30
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,760
someone they appear to be more

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
professorial

32
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,560
um

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,800
and normally i'm seeing with my glasses

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,040
so it's uh

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,000
not too bad today but professor garfield

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
here does have glasses

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,840
and um

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
his basic job

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,519
is to teach his doofus kitten normal

40
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,040
not to be stupid on the internet

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,239
why

42
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,440
well because

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
in this

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
sector of the garfield universe

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
his nemesis odie's a dog

46
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
is mean and evil

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
and wants to steal normal's passwords

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
and basically mess up his computer

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
so we've got to keep normal safe from

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,640
odie

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,319
basically

52
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
we're teaching normal

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,959
to be safe on the internet

54
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
and if some elementary or middle school

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
students

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,480
happen to catch the lessons as well so

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
much the better

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,599
at least this big bad hacker dude

59
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,720
doesn't have to teach the lessons

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,720
um

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,400
let's see

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
we are at uh

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,720
if you google uh garfield foundation

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,080
uh you can find links to this stuff

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,120
and unfortunately professorgarfield.org

66
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
is off the air currently

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
which i thought was very embarrassing

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
when i looked it up this morning for my

69
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,920
talk

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
um but

71
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
there's a professor at nyu who's

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
involved with it

73
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
ball state university is involved with

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
it and pause inc

75
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
which is of course the creator of

76
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,080
garfield

77
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
uh is involved with it

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,080
um it's very cool that all these people

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,840
want to help educate the youth of

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
america on how to properly use a

81
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,480
computer

82
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,560
and the internet

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
and not get messed up

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,560
um

85
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,880
let's see that's

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,479
pretty much the lecture

87
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
it's short but sweet because that's all

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
there is to it it's

89
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,240
go back to your fifth grade students or

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
elementary students or middle school

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
students

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
and send them over to

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
the garfield websites

94
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,919
have them go through the comic books

95
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
that are up there online

96
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
i'll have them learn as normal learns

97
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,400
how not to be taken advantage of by odie

98
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,040
and his ilk

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,919
and

100
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,880
hopefully we'll get the word out

101
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,520
the youngsters need to be taught

102
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,840
and not by a big bad hacker dude

103
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,960
any questions or

104
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,359
comments

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,800
yeah it's a very short talk

106
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
but you can see that um

107
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
there really isn't that much to it bring

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
up garfield go through his stories and

109
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,520
he will explain to your youngsters

110
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
as to how to be much safer on the

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
internet than they could be

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,479
uh that's

113
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
the whole point of the exercise

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
make the internet safe for people um

115
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
make them aware of the evil dogs out

116
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,199
there that want to mess up their

117
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,880
internet access

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
and uh hopefully they'll have better

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,080
times on the internet

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,680
let's see what else we have out here

121
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
some other images of garfield and

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,080
professor garfield

123
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,400
literacy worldwide.org interesting

124
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,919
for digital safety with professor

125
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,919
garfield can you just go back before it

126
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,680
became garfield you were saying what was

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,120
it okay before before became child

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
friendly what were you doing can you

129
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
give a little more of the back story

130
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,759
again

131
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,199
well um i'm a big bad hacker dude and uh

132
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,680
but also in titusville i hang out in a

133
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
place called space view park

134
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,680
for every rocket launch from the kennedy

135
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
space center right across the river from

136
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,160
titusville

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,199
i think that's where i first met the

138
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,800
fifth grade teacher

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
and uh we probably got to talking and i

140
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
explained about the cheshire catalyst my

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,560
big bad hacker identity

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
and um

143
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,240
you may have thought it cool to turn it

144
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
over to a 5th grade class but it freaked

145
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
me out

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,880
and i just don't want to be responsible

147
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,840
for the kids going to the dark side

148
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
um

149
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,680
and

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,759
i need the help of garfield the cat

151
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,199
professor garfield

152
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
to turn him over to the light side of

153
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,199
the force

154
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
so

155
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
let's see

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,880
what else we got here

157
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
um do a visit on that

158
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,919
professor garfield and taking a look

159
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,880
create read play

160
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
and that's something i believe in

161
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,639
don't work at learning your computer

162
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
play with it

163
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,759
try things out

164
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
see what it really does those drop down

165
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
menus across the top of your screen

166
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
drop them down take a look at them try

167
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
things out see what they really do

168
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
not just what the instruction manual

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
tells you they do

170
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,719
you might be surprised

171
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840
let's

172
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
see professor garfield's extreme

173
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,318
comics

174
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720

176
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,879

kids

188
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,839
uh so that they're warned about them

189
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,240
and they know to steer clear of them or

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,720

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,800
garfield foundation.org

195
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
i couldn't find what we were looking for

196
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
let's just get okay to your web browser

197
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,440
there you go

198
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,399
okay

199
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,560
thank you

200
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
all right

201
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,519
let's look at the students video

202
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
hmm

203
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,680
all right

204
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,720
yes

205
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,920
so

206
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,079
the website is not up and running right

207
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
apparently not yes so what what are some

208
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
stuff we can expect on the website if it

209
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,079
is up and running can you tell us a

210
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
little about the content of it

211
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,760
these videos i'm trying to bring up

212
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
should be there

213
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,600
um ball state university probably has

214
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,079
them on their site

215
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,880
yeah

216
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,920
with the help of uh

217
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,360
jim what's his name garfield's creator

218
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,720
let's see

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,399
let's see what wikipedia has

220
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
other media

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
so

222
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,000
let's try something else

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,920
apparently there was a computer game for

224
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
the atari

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,720
called big fat hairy deal which is a

226
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,880
common

227
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,079
expression of garfield the cat

228
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,839
and another one called garfield a tale

229
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
of two kitties

230
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,839
known as garfield 2 in europe

231
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,600
created as a partnership between the

232
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
non-profit professor garfield foundation

233
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
and ball state university the site

234
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,279
features jim davis's famous cat

235
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
character who acts as a resident educat

236
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,880
or on a lazy spaceship

237
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
robots help kids decide which activities

238
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
to try first and there are quite a few

239
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,040
of them to try

240
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,959
you might drop by the art bot to watch

241
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,639
videos on how to draw garfield and other

242
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,120
animals

243
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,639
so this is on commonsense.org

244
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360

245
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,639
