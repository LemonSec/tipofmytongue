9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,640
closing ceremonies at six o'clock

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,520
tonight in this venue it will be

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
simulcast in the dac 206 which is on the

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
second floor instead of a little theater

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
so if there's not room here go down the

14
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
second floor go to 206 and there you can

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
see the simulcast

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
uh

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,560

during disintegration lessons from a

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,680
brief history of yugoslav computing by

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,799
vlado vincey

31
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,200

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,038
and i want to just give a huge shout out

35
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,318
to the organizers this has been a

36
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,000
fantastic conference and it's so good to

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
be back here

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
so

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
there's been

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
sort of a

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,959
series of news stories over the last

42
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,640
couple of years

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,879
describing how tech companies from

44
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,480
certain countries are getting banned

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,640
from operating in other ones

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
the famous one being huawei the chinese

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
telecommunications giant

48
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,360
that's been banned in the u.s parts of

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,480
europe

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
and ever since the russian invasion of

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,599
ukraine on february 24th

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,920
a huge number of tech companies have

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
stopped doing business in russia as well

54
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,040
partially this has been as part of

55
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,319
larger sanctions but tech in particular

56
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,519
has been in the focus as

57
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,000
it really is an integral part of so many

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,319
industries

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,080
that even

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
you know

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
manufacturers of cars

62
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,800
depend on so much that the russian car

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,959
industry has been largely hit because

64
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
they can no longer get electronics to

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
put in their cars

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
considering the world that we lived in

67
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,159
for the last 30 or so years where

68
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
free trade and communications

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
dominated most of the world these types

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,239
of stories are somewhat new to us but

71
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
they're not really new

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
in the wider history following the end

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
of world war ii and through the end of

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,400
the cold war um we lived in a block

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
system with really

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
two main warring sides that

77
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
had very little

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
technical and economic corporation

79
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,239
during this period

80
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
the

81
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
dynamics that were common at this time

82
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,920
were

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
soon forgotten as we as we moved into

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
the 90s but um we we might be getting

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,959
back um to to some of those and what

86
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
i've decided to do today is

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,519
tell you a story about a country that um

88
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,560
was

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,959
somewhere in between during this cold

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,200
war period and that country is

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,120
yugoslavia

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
we're going to take a look at

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,759
specific technological developments in

94
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,080
this country that no longer exists and

95
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
then we're going to try to take some

96
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
lessons for a potential new world that

97
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
we're moving into that might have

98
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
a little bit more barriers um and

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,600
borders and limitations than we've

100
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
gotten used to in the last 30 years

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
but before i get into that i'm going to

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,759
quickly introduce myself and tell you

103
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
why i'm telling you about all of this so

104
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,479
this is me my name is vlado i'm a tech

105
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,800
worker i live here in new york

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
i don't live in midtown manhattan i like

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,880
this view though

108
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,800
i live in brooklyn

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
however i i grew up in a small country

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,919
uh on the adriatic coast um that country

111
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,919
is now known for uh people going on

112
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
their on their vacations there it's

113
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,280
called croatia

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,840
however uh up until um 31 or so years it

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,160
was called yugoslavia

116
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,440
and

117
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
the story of the yugoslav state is

118
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,160
really complicated so i'm going to try

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
to give you basic facts because i

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
presume a lot of you don't remember it

121
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
and some of you may not even know what

122
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,199
it was

123
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
i'm gonna try to do this in three

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,320
minutes or less i could probably not do

125
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
it in three days or 30 days or less but

126
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,759
just bear with me

127
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,400
yugoslavia was founded after world war

128
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
one technically but we're going to

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
ignore the state that existed there in

130
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,600
the

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
uh brief interwar period and we're going

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to focus on the state it was founded

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,880
after

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
the anti-fascist liberation movement of

135
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
yugoslavia liberated the country after

136
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
world war ii

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
this movement was led by yugoslav

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
communists so they also founded a

139
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
socialist state

140
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,560
following the war

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
this state was aligned with the ussr for

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
a very brief period about three years

143
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,720
and then um tito the leader of

144
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
yugoslavia um got into a fight with

145
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,199
stalin and we broke off from them um i

146
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,080
don't know if this story in the tweet

147
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
above is true but that's basically the

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
sentiment that the yugoslavs had

149
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,319
following this split

150
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,639
this was quite significant

151
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,360
because at the time

152
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
the world was getting increasingly

153
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,479
polarized and especially so in europe

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
where essentially every other socialist

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,919
country

156
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
fell under the iron curtain whereas

157
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
on the western side of the continent

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
most countries aligned with the united

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
states and nato there of course were

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
some notable neutral ones uh marked and

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
gray over here but yugoslavia as a

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,960
socialist but not soviet aligned country

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,240
was quite a bit of an aberration there

164
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
following the split in 1948

165
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
yugoslavia focused on developing its own

166
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,599
mode of socialism that very soon

167
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,360
started to revolve around this idea of

168
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
self-management where instead of

169
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
kind of doing top-down central control

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,599
that was very common in the ussr

171
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,440
they would basically develop work

172
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
theories of how workers could take

173
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,960
active

174
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,080
decision-making roles within

175
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
organizations and companies there's of

176
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
course a lot of debate how successful

177
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
that was but it did made it quite

178
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,479
different than its peer

179
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
eastern bloc countries

180
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
additionally

181
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
starting in the early 50s collaboration

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,199
with the united states and western

183
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
europe

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
was rising both in terms of trade

185
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
academia even military aid but

186
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
yugoslavia never aligned itself with the

187
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
west

188
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,759
instead it sort of tried to exploit this

189
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,039
middle ground

190
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,318
and it did so quite well

191
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,520
in the

192
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,039
late 50s early 60s it founded the

193
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
non-aligned movement

194
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,560
along with

195
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
egypt and india and a whole bunch of

196
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
other countries most of which were

197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
recently independent post-colonial

198
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
states

199
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,199
and

200
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,919
it really tried to use this space to

201
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,240
establish itself on the world stage but

202
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,440
also

203
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
to use it for its own internal

204
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
development

205
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,360
similarly how both nato and the warsaw

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,839
pact were not just military alliances

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,719
but also economic blocks where the

208
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
countries leading them were using

209
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
this environment for trade and

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,880
influence onto others so did yugoslavia

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,399
so during this period a lot of the

212
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
yugoslav economy is focused on exporting

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
the

214
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,560
engineering and other types of expertise

215
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,959
into what we now refer to as the global

216
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,959
south at that time they called it the

217
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
third world and it wasn't the derogatory

218
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,080
term

219
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,320
the third world at a time was the world

220
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,839
that wasn't

221
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,760
nato and it wasn't the warsaw pact it

222
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
was everybody else and there was

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
actually quite a lot of everybody else

224
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,519
now uh yugoslavia was was quite

225
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
successful in this but um it always had

226
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
its eyes to the west

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
in the late 80s you may have

228
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
seen the infamous hugo car which was um

229
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,279
the final attempt to break into the

230
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,040
united states with

231
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,279
yugoslavia's car industry this did not

232
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
work so well

233
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,080
but all of this of course

234
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
ends in war

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
the scope of this talk

236
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,760
is not to talk about the war that

237
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
followed

238
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
in the early 90s but

239
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
you will see

240
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,600
as we get to the later phases of the 80s

241
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
the um

242
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,279
the fear of conflict starts to influence

243
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,240
everything including technology so just

244
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
keep that in mind

245
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,200
the

246
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,279
war in yugoslavia was a tragedy and

247
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,920
it always um the the moments that i'm

248
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
describing here with tensions in trade

249
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
with with blocks

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,480
there's always this this fear of war and

251
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,560
with us living through a time of war

252
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,880
right now i just want us to keep that in

253
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
mind as we think about

254
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
computers

255
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
let's talk about computers

256
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,519
i'm going to

257
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
tell you three distinct stories

258
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
the first going to be about enterprise

259
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,680
which is sort of a weird term um but

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
it's basically going to be a story about

261
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,160
uh what was happening in the actual

262
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
computer industry in this country the

263
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
second one is going to be about normal

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,519
people i'm going to tell you a

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,920
fascinating story about a diy

266
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
microcomputer that was developed by a

267
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
young engineer essentially as a solution

268
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
to bring microcomputers to yugoslavs who

269
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,720
couldn't get them

270
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,839
and finally i'm going to tell you a

271
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,240
little bit about networks and that's a

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,480
story where those two

273
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
earlier stories converge

274
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
the first story is about iskra delta

275
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
that i'm going to call a yugoslav

276
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
startup although that is probably not

277
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
the right and

278
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
precise term but it's a company that i

279
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,800
think

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,279
really includes a lot of these

281
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,920
interesting dynamics that develop in a

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,360
country that is at the same time

283
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
both sort of closed and limited in its

284
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,079
access to what is happening

285
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,320
in america where the computing

286
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
revolution is really centered

287
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
but it has quite enough access so that

288
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
it can break through and basically

289
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
develop its own version

290
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,360
of silicon valley culture

291
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
but before that let's look at the first

292
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
yugoslav computer so this is the cr10

293
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,399
mainframe from 1960. this is a vacuum

294
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
tube mainframe that was developed

295
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,639
completely internally and domestically

296
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,320
in yugoslavia

297
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
it was finished in 1960 and was used for

298
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
about 10 years in different types of

299
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,680
institutions

300
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
this one is from the tanya news agency

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,880
but

302
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,680
it got some work in the military and

303
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,120
generally big big yugoslav companies

304
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
however

305
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
even though in that early phase there

306
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,120
were big ambitions to develop a domestic

307
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
computing industry and mind you in 1960

308
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
not a lot of countries had something

309
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,040
called a computing industry

310
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
there's this thing called cocom

311
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,399
the cocom was the coordinating committee

312
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
for multilateral export controls a body

313
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
of the us government founded soon after

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,920
world war ii essentially to

315
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,279
establish a mechanism to enforce the

316
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,880
types of controls that we're talking

317
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,519
about here so uh when you have a world

318
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,279
with an increasing number of countries

319
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,240
that are

320
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
dividing themselves in blocks

321
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
an institution like this will help you

322
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
basically prioritize what you are

323
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,680
allowed to sell to whom and under what

324
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
conditions

325
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,680
it was used to essentially limit export

326
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
to of course the eastern bloc but also a

327
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,519
lot of the third uh party countries and

328
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,920
um yugoslavia found itself in kind of a

329
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,639
good position here as a third country

330
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120
cooperation country meaning that while

331
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
it wasn't a member of kokom most members

332
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
were nato states and a couple of

333
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,639
neutral ones like switzerland

334
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,279
it was a good enough position that most

335
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
american companies by the late 60s

336
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
didn't really have a problem setting up

337
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,360
shop and of course they did

338
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
the uh

339
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,440
big blue was one of the first but others

340
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,880
followed as well honeywell dec they were

341
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,959
all there and

342
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
they kind of did what they do else

343
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
everywhere else

344
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,639
they just take over the internal market

345
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,920
so the

346
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
domestic cucus of mainframe industry was

347
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
essentially dead um by the early to mid

348
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,959
70s companies were increasingly using

349
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,800
western-made computers

350
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
these companies would have

351
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
their representatives their teams that

352
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,079
would install them support them and for

353
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,040
the most part it was it was it was

354
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,320
really led from the outside in

355
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,360
however

356
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,600
a company that had a slightly different

357
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
approach was digital equipment

358
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,800
corporation

359
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
and

360
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,399
what they did was start forming very

361
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,639
close partnerships

362
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,399
with certain folks in the country

363
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,880
particularly in the

364
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,560
western republic of yugoslavia slovenia

365
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,600
and

366
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
a lot of locals from yugoslavia ended up

367
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
going to the u.s to get trained

368
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,120
to support install

369
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
and work on these computers

370
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
and they were having such a great time

371
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
and such a good collaboration

372
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,040
that they soon started doing their own

373
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,079
work

374
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,120
initially under the umbrella of an old

375
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,079
uh of an older bigger company called

376
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,560
electro techno founding their digital

377
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,760
department

378
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,639
and

379
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,360
soon splitting into their own as delta

380
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,920
and finally merging with another company

381
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,600
called iskra into iska delta computers

382
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
all of these are just sort of

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,680
not particularly important details but

384
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,360
what this meant was that suddenly in the

385
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,600
late 70s you have a domestic company

386
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
that really grew

387
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
within a couple of years

388
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
into not only a

389
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
partner of a big american corporation

390
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,720
but essentially something resembling an

391
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
oem

392
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,160
and this partnership

393
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,800
was not about cloning or copying

394
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,160
equipment

395
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
it was about working under license from

396
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
an american corporation to develop

397
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
products for the domestic and also

398
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,320
export market

399
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,959
by the early 80s there are

400
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,839
yugoslav versions of the pdp-11

401
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,199
there's two of them one of them being

402
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,759
the pmp-11 that was developed at the

403
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
institution of stefan and the delta 800.

404
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,839
so

405
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,360
these are essentially pdp-11 compatibles

406
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,079
developed in partnership

407
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,240
with an american company

408
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
there's uh licensing agreements and you

409
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
know it's just business as usual but not

410
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,639
something you would expect

411
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,399
with a socialist country

412
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,440
they also expand into microcomputers um

413
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,600
the two notable examples being the

414
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,839
treeglove or the trident which was a

415
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,680
really interesting machine

416
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
built to support two different cpus

417
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,560
depending on what you needed it also had

418
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
this adorable

419
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,839
all-in-one

420
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,279
case that also had a special box in the

421
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
rear for pencils so that you could you

422
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
know access your important tools when

423
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
you're working on your computer

424
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
unfortunately or fortunately the trend

425
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,720
of multi-cpu as needed trend did not

426
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,079
necessarily continue the way the

427
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,240
slovenian experts imagined it but

428
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,079
another more traditional one was the

429
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,439
delta partner

430
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,359
which was sort of your more typical

431
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,959
early 80s

432
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,559
micro running on a z80

433
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
the final accomplishment of iskar delta

434
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,919
was getting a huge contract

435
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,760
in china in the mar in the mid 1980s and

436
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
just to contextualize this this is a

437
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
period when china is really only opening

438
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
up and in terms of technological

439
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
development they're really trying to

440
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
catch up and they're trying to catch up

441
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,039
very quickly

442
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,320
they somehow stumble upon iskra delta at

443
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,520
the um in from information technology

444
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,960
fair in zagreb and they end up hiring

445
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
escrow delta for this huge project

446
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
essentially connecting 10 of their

447
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,919
largest cities into a network that will

448
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,160
be used by the yugoslav

449
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,520
pardon me chinese police

450
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,039
this is a

451
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,679
sort of an unprecedented project for a

452
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,520
company of this scale

453
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,640
the distances between chinese cities are

454
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
larger than all of yugoslavia is

455
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,919
but they actually managed to do it

456
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,840
there's a lot of stories about the

457
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,520
details of how they managed to get the

458
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,160
licensing to actually operate in the

459
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,039
public people's republic of china

460
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,559
but

461
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,080
this is sort of the pinnacle of the

462
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
yugos of ict

463
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,360
in this non-aligned period so they are

464
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760
using this advantage of

465
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,600
having a privileged relationship with

466
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,919
the united states of working closely

467
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,480
with an american corporation and then

468
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,320
they're basically selling this expertise

469
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,120
and

470
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,960
building networks and computing

471
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,919
environments sort of on the other side

472
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,080
by this point they're also doing some of

473
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,520
those things in other eastern bloc

474
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,480
countries since this whole tito stalin

475
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,600
very um very hard and intense split of

476
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,440
course has gotten a little less intense

477
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,400
um in the 30 years since it happened

478
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
so this is a story about what was

479
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,799
happening at the higher level uh what

480
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,520
was it like for people

481
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,160
i'm gonna tell you this story through

482
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,200
this amazing history of galaxia because

483
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
unfortunately in the early 80s

484
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
things were not so great for everyday

485
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
yugoslavs

486
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,799
even though

487
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,400
we were accustomed to a higher level

488
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,720
a higher standard of living than our

489
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
peers in the eastern bloc

490
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
even though we had the right to travel

491
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
we had passports which could freely

492
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
travel to the west without visas

493
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
a lot of products that folks were really

494
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
used to in western europe and of course

495
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,799
in america were just not available

496
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,919
to yugoslavs due to restrictive import

497
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,480
policies some of which were there to

498
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
protect the domestic industry

499
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,559
interestingly even though there was this

500
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,039
very developed enterprise computing

501
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,440
industry there was really no

502
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
microcomputing industry so

503
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,240
in the early 1980s yugoslavs really

504
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,799
could not buy any computers at home

505
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,960
so what'd they do they would travel to

506
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
trieste

507
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,760
in italy

508
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,799
this is the famous ponterosso square

509
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,240
where for 30 or so years you could find

510
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,159
yugoslavs from all over the country

511
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,000
buying electronics vcrs computers

512
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
levi's jeans

513
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
anything that there wasn't available at

514
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
home

515
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,080
the

516
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
trick about this was they couldn't

517
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
legally bring them home

518
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
so um this is this is a comic strip from

519
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,919
from the period um someone trying to

520
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,320
import a zx spectrum

521
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,720
the import limitation at the time was 50

522
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
deutsche marks and not even the zx

523
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
spectrum could be bought for

524
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,799
50 deutsche marks

525
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,520
so

526
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
even as late as 1983

527
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,559
yugoslavs couldn't technically buy

528
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,640
microcomputers and

529
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,720
this wasn't great a lot of them wanted

530
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,760
them but the only way to do them was you

531
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,840
either had to have someone living abroad

532
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,679
who would bring it to you or you would

533
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
go to trieste and then you would smuggle

534
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,840
one a lot of people smuggled them

535
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,200
however come the summer of 1983

536
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
a wonderful story happens so

537
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,559
the two gentlemen over here are voya

538
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
antonic and dan ristanovic

539
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
voya was a young engineer

540
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,919
taking a holiday on the adriatic coast

541
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,600
kind of liking that photo that i showed

542
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,799
earlier

543
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
and of course he didn't want to spend

544
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
time on the beach he was hanging out at

545
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,640
the hotel

546
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
scribbling something in his notebook and

547
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,520
designing a microcomputer

548
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,679
on a piece of paper

549
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,360
meanwhile de andrestanovic was a young

550
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,080
magazine editor journalist

551
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
living in belgrade and working on a

552
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,240
special edition of the popular science

553
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,039
magazine galaxy or galaxy

554
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,080
that would focus solely on computers

555
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
considering that folks couldn't get

556
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,880
computers

557
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
freely they wanted to bring the story of

558
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,240
computers to them through this magazine

559
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,159
now a mutual friend introduced them and

560
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
they soon realized

561
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,039
they should collaborate on this

562
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,919
so

563
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,200
voya and dan

564
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
spend the next

565
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,280
five to six months

566
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,880
and of course a lot of other people

567
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
helping them

568
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,840
working on a special edition of this

569
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,039
magazine called computers in your home

570
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
now what's the deal with the computers

571
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,919
in your home

572
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,799
a magazine not not a big deal

573
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,799
it wasn't just a magazine it was

574
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,240
basically a large media project

575
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,360
that would

576
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,000
introduce not just computers but also

577
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,600
instructions and education for folks to

578
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,840
build their own computer at home if they

579
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,520
couldn't buy one legally if they would

580
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
have to smuggle it from abroad

581
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
why not give them a way to obtain all

582
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,799
the necessary parts legally because the

583
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,559
computer was designed to be just cheap

584
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,840
enough that you can import parts

585
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
yourself and assemble it

586
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
and then make it yourself

587
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
so here's what that computer looked like

588
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
in terms of configuration

589
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,960
not unusual for

590
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,640
actually a little unusual for the mid

591
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,960
80s not unusual for the late 70s early

592
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
early 80s and what you can notice here

593
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,720
is it's

594
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,799
definitely a little underpowered but the

595
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,039
reason why it is underpowered is because

596
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,000
it's designed precisely so

597
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
that when you order all of your parts

598
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
you need to get from the outside they're

599
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,159
coming just under that 50 deutsche mark

600
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,840
mark

601
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
this works really well

602
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
folks got schematics they get all

603
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,640
necessary instructions

604
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
they start making them at home

605
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,159
yova is the man on the right in this

606
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,440
picture

607
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,760
he and the team around the magazine

608
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,159
spend the next year

609
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,360
basically supporting thousands of young

610
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,600
mostly teenage yugoslavs

611
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
desperately waiting for their part so

612
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,279
they can assemble their computers

613
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,559
and

614
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,360
they

615
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,840
they really do more

616
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,640
for

617
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
the development of

618
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,799
of computing for regular folks than

619
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,159
anyone else really up until that period

620
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,480
some records show that uh

621
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
80 to 90 000

622
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
issues of this magazine were sold and

623
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
that at least 10 000 people ended up

624
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,200
building a machine

625
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
so for a small country like yugoslavia

626
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,000
this was this was unprecedented thanks

627
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
to this one

628
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,880
project

629
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,440
computers are suddenly and seemingly

630
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
everywhere so

631
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
this is what this magazine looks like

632
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,159
this little piece of paper contains

633
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,080
everything necessary for you to build

634
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,880
your own computer so what did i do when

635
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,840
the pandemic hit and i was stuck at home

636
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,320
i built one

637
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,920
thank you

638
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,559
[Applause]

639
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,919
and i built it

640
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,480
really mostly following the instructions

641
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
in this magazine which is which is

642
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
fascinating to me because folks were

643
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
doing this 40 years ago i had the whole

644
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,200
of the internet and human knowledge at

645
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,120
my at my fingertips they had the

646
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,279
magazine but they they still attempted

647
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,679
and succeeded in doing it

648
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,760
you can also do it yourself and i just

649
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,440
want to give a shout out to north starch

650
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,559
press

651
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,840
because

652
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,320
down on the lower level they have this

653
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,840
wonderful poc or gtfo volume 2 book

654
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
where there's a full translation in

655
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
english with all the instructions and

656
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
you can do it today

657
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
you can also get the pcb today

658
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,480
and voya

659
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
40 years later

660
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,000
is still updating the instructions now

661
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
on hackaday

662
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,880
so check out the references at the end

663
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,159
of the presentation if you want to build

664
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,320
one

665
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,679
however

666
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
this project was so successful

667
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,480
that by the end of 1984

668
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,320
the law that limited the importer of

669
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,919
computers from abroad

670
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,520
is expressly changed and everybody is

671
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,840
just getting their zx spectrums and some

672
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
commodore 64s

673
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
so this is

674
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,840
very indicative of this dynamic where

675
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,200
the limitations imposed on the folks and

676
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,279
the limitations that really caused this

677
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
burst of creativity and ultimately

678
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,880
success

679
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,320
they sort of end up defeating themselves

680
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,600
in that by being so successful

681
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,480
the limitations are then taken away

682
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,720
and none of none of that domestic

683
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,799
ingenuity is really necessary i think

684
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,720
that is quite a quite an interesting

685
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,159
bittersweet a little bit beautiful

686
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,200
dynamic

687
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,600
um it also results in some bizarre

688
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,279
instances so

689
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,840
even though the um

690
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,400
limitations for folks to import this and

691
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,960
buy this stuff themselves were dropped

692
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
yugoslav schools were still under a

693
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
mandate to purchase domestically

694
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,919
produced computers

695
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,600
so what did one company do

696
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,679
they put in zx spectrums into a keyboard

697
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,080
case by make and ended up making a

698
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
really good keyboard for the zx spectrum

699
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,000
but essentially selling a domestic

700
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
computer that's made in the uk

701
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,440
now um this is not a clone um yugoslavs

702
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,919
could get by this point real zx spectrum

703
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,039
so

704
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,399
sinclair was just selling them the

705
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,000
boards and they were putting them in

706
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,279
this in this case

707
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,360
what happens

708
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,679
with the networks at the same time

709
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,399
we've looked at what was happening at a

710
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,200
high level in enterprise we looked at

711
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,919
what happened with regular folks by the

712
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,279
mid 1980s computers are becoming

713
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,159
sort of

714
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,720
easy enough to access for folks like you

715
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,600
and me

716
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,799
but

717
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
even though we can now access computers

718
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,880
and even though we have

719
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
a computing industry

720
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,840
sophisticated enough to develop a

721
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,640
large-scale network in china what's

722
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
happening in our own country

723
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,399
let's take a look at what's happening in

724
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,200
in europe and the us at the same time

725
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,320
they are trying to figure out what

726
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
they're going to go with tcpip is

727
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
gaining traction in the u.s the

728
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
europeans are really stuck on the isi

729
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
model and x-25

730
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,440
really through the uh 1980s

731
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
and the yugoslavs well

732
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,039
we're just trying to figure things out

733
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,200
very slowly

734
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,480
in the 70s

735
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,080
they work on the sntij or the system now

736
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,279
technology information yugoslavia

737
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
which is basically a way to

738
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
connect libraries it doesn't really go

739
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,600
very far

740
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,559
through the 80s academic institutions

741
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,279
and

742
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,279
mind you academic institutions from

743
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,480
different parts of the country are

744
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
trying different things

745
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
but they're connecting to different

746
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,120
types of european networks some examples

747
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,760
are the euro net uh eu net er e a r n

748
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,440
that one's actually quite interesting

749
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,360
because it actually provides a

750
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,679
connection to the american bit net which

751
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,279
can then provide you sort of a

752
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,919
connection to the wider internet

753
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,360
this is based on ibm technology

754
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,640
in the very late 80s there's also unit

755
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,520
and

756
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,159
unac which eventually end up being the

757
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
projects that finally connect the

758
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
yugoslavs to the internet literally as

759
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,799
the country falls apart

760
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,960
in 1991 this is what the networked world

761
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,000
looked like the countries in purple are

762
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,320
directly connected to the internet and

763
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,240
then the countries in red which

764
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,799
yugoslavia is one of

765
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,960
sort of have a connection to the

766
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,399
internet through these x25 or

767
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,880
proprietary networks

768
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,320
like the ibm v-net um basically most of

769
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,200
the world is not online in a sense that

770
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,039
we know it today

771
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,600
but an interesting project that emerges

772
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
in the early 80s

773
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,320
is the upak or the yugoslav packet

774
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,679
switching network

775
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,640
which develops as this sort of very

776
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,679
top-down bureaucratic project

777
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,159
being developed by the yugoslav

778
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,279
post telegraph and telephone service

779
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,399
um it sort of struggles along and it

780
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,360
mainly struggles along because um just

781
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
like everything else in yugoslavia at

782
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,760
the time and this is definitely sort of

783
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,159
announcing some things to come

784
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,080
every republic is developing this

785
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,760
project independently

786
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,880
so

787
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
out of the six republics

788
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,799
each one sort of goes through their own

789
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,520
process of identifying the vendor hiring

790
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,240
them developing this network and upak

791
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,559
really struggles along the project

792
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,440
starts in 1983. uh it's operational in

793
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,279
slovenia by 86 croatia by the 87 serbia

794
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,720
by 89

795
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
most of the rest of the country is never

796
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,640
connected but here you can see you know

797
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,279
in the initial 1983 plans they were

798
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,440
supposed to cover the whole country with

799
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,679
this x-25 network uh trunks were 64

800
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,519
kilobits

801
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,000
it wasn't a fast network but it was a

802
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,120
packet switching network and upex sort

803
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,679
of just stays in the background as a

804
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,919
project nobody's actually actively using

805
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,880
it almost until the very end

806
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,960
and the very end comes around 89.90

807
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,679
the woman in the picture is borca yerman

808
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,440
blasic

809
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,440
she is a researcher in slovenia who

810
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,640
was working

811
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
in the late 80s

812
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,559
basically doing academic research on

813
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,279
networks and she went to a conference in

814
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,919
santa fe probably 88

815
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,200
and

816
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,919
she has this quote she said

817
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,039
i saw how terribly deprived we were in

818
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,559
comparison to others and this is a

819
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,720
reference to her seeing her colleagues

820
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,039
and even her european colleagues

821
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,679
whip out their luggable computers and

822
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,880
connect to their emails

823
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,640
from the united states meanwhile since

824
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
her university and her sort of very

825
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,760
limited email really had no connections

826
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,799
to the outside um she could just sort of

827
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,360
sit there and and

828
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,799
and wait

829
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,320
she comes home and she registers the dot

830
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,159
y u domain uh this is in 1989 um and

831
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,120
this is probably the 20th or so

832
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,480
uh country level top level domain um she

833
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,399
registered sit with ayanna and she

834
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,720
starts working on

835
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,559
finally connecting our country to the

836
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,080
wider internet

837
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,039
this is a dramatic process that

838
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,760
is really happening

839
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,039
through

840
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,960
the moments that the country is rapidly

841
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
disintegrating

842
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,320
there's uh

843
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,440
basically a number of bureaucratic steps

844
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,279
that need to be taken

845
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,919
and the jurisdictions are starting to

846
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,880
get sort of mixed up between different

847
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,960
republics she is taking planes to

848
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,120
belgrade she's meeting with security

849
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,760
services but you know she's she keeps

850
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,120
this going and of course there's a

851
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,039
number of other colleagues

852
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,720
working on this as well

853
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,760
they get their primary dns server at uc

854
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,960
berkeley

855
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,880
and in late 1990 they make a request for

856
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,600
the first ip range for yugoslavia and

857
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
that this is soon delivered

858
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,639
uh meanwhile

859
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,080
the country sort of doesn't even exist

860
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,159
anymore in a full sense there is

861
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,159
basically open revolt

862
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,840
between the republics

863
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,519
um the last congress of the um

864
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,480
yugoslav

865
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
communist party is

866
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,799
dissolved as the croatian slovenian

867
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,159
delegates

868
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,080
leave and protest

869
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,279
and

870
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,519
while this is happening they actually

871
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,480
make a connection to the internet they

872
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
connect to tcp via x-25 through a node

873
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,839
in vienna

874
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,960
and then the war starts

875
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,879
the

876
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,918
june 25th 1991 proclamation of

877
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,320
independence of slovenia and croatia

878
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,918
prompts a 10-day war in slovenia that

879
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,719
begins on june 27th and one of the first

880
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,760
targets

881
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,079
are the transmitters on the border with

882
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,119
austria

883
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,359
this actually interrupts this internet

884
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,199
connection for the first time it's

885
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,760
eventually repaired and over the next

886
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,280
couple of months there's this sort of

887
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,359
no man's land in terms of the internet

888
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,520
as the countries are basically becoming

889
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,480
independent

890
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
but the infrastructure is still

891
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,199
interconnected

892
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,800
recently there was a fantastic talk at

893
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,760
the

894
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,960
ripe ncc southeast europe conference in

895
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
ljubljana where

896
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,960
yelena chosich and soboda markovic

897
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,000
presented this graph really showing the

898
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,359
relationship between assignment of ip

899
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,320
ranges to what was happening as the

900
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,119
country was disintegrating so

901
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,440
we can kind of see how

902
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,320
slovenia declares independence and ip

903
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,560
range is given to

904
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,720
university of belgrade

905
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,280
unac this project from the 80s that was

906
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
supposed to bring the internet to

907
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,839
yugoslavia gets his first subnet in

908
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,280
september 91. mind you at this point war

909
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,800
is actively going on in croatia

910
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,040
croatia then declares independence in

911
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,839
october after a three-month moratorium

912
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,200
and

913
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,720
april 1992 when the war in bosnia starts

914
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,839
is generally used as the point where

915
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,160
this country really and fully no longer

916
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,839
exists and then we can start to see how

917
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,920
additional ip assignments are actually

918
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,880
getting

919
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,079
assigned to individual countries so

920
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,960
in

921
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,000
may of 1992 a first ip range is given to

922
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
carnet which becomes the academic

923
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,720
network in croatia

924
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,079
we're not going to talk about this

925
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,640
further because at this point yugoslavia

926
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,000
is no more

927
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
i'm going to give you

928
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,920
just a quick little story about what is

929
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,320
happening to everyday folks at this time

930
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,160
so we're going to go back just a couple

931
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,320
of years

932
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,680
all of these

933
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,960
big academic networks are inaccessible

934
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,280
in a similar way that a pdp-11 was

935
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,119
inaccessible and what escrow delta was

936
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,839
doing wasn't necessarily relevant for

937
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,240
everyday folks in their everyday life

938
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,520
but

939
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,000
in the late 80s first bbs's start

940
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,119
appearing

941
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,480
in yugoslavia the most famous of which

942
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,520
is probably the sesame bbs which funnily

943
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,160
enough was founded among others by dan

944
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,200
ristanovich of the retronary vashikuchi

945
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
and galaxy of fame so everything sort of

946
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,880
comes together

947
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
and

948
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,640
interestingly enough sesame is still

949
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
sort of offline except i've been unable

950
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,440
to get credentials for it someone is

951
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
running it on a vm

952
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,119
where apparently everything is still

953
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,160
kept

954
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,640
but i was lucky enough to obtain this

955
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,400
instructions manual from

956
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,880
from from the late 80s so every day

957
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,119
yugoslavs do start talking to one

958
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,599
another in the late 80s over bbs's and

959
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,560
they start spin getting spun up around

960
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
the country there's probably a couple of

961
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,079
thousand people talking at this time and

962
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,680
they do transcend these republic borders

963
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,960
at a time when politically

964
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,720
these republics that will soon become

965
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,400
independent countries are really

966
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,720
drifting apart

967
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,640
in major and major ways that eventually

968
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,240
end up in war

969
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
there are some messages that you can

970
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,119
find online the authenticity of which is

971
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,760
somewhat difficult to confirm that

972
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
basically show you the types of

973
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,599
interactions that we're we're sort of

974
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,240
used to seeing nowadays on twitter when

975
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,640
conflict like the war in ukraine happens

976
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,800
where people are arguing about what is

977
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
real and what is not and we actually

978
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,119
have examples of that um from 1991 as

979
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,800
the wars in

980
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,760
yugoslavia are just getting started

981
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,839
but there are some positive stories

982
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,599
there too

983
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,760
in the spring of 1992

984
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,560
the

985
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,720
war in slovenia is over the war in

986
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,000
croatia is ongoing the war in bosnia is

987
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,240
just getting started and communication

988
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,280
is becoming increasingly difficult

989
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,240
the phone lines are working only

990
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,800
sometimes other forms of communications

991
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,880
like transportation you can no longer

992
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,760
take the train you can no longer drive

993
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,160
to the countries that are now at war

994
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,359
so

995
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,760
a couple of anti-war groups

996
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,480
get connected to some of these remaining

997
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,440
bbs operators and they organized them

998
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,720
into the zamir transnational network

999
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,640
zamyad meaning for peace

1000
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,520
which

1001
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,320
gets started essentially as a link

1002
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,520
between folks in croatia and serbia

1003
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,839
which are now essentially at war so they

1004
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,280
can talk to their friends they can

1005
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,920
collaborate so that people fighting

1006
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,800
against the war can collaborate across

1007
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,079
these borders

1008
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,720
and

1009
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,560
1994 they also make a connection to

1010
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
sarevo which

1011
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,760
at this time is under siege for two

1012
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,079
years and communication is increasingly

1013
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,800
difficult so they basically provide a

1014
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,680
first public link outside this city for

1015
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,960
regular citizens and just as a reminder

1016
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,280
tens of thousands of people were living

1017
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,000
in sarajevo during this siege

1018
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,160
and

1019
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,079
they also make a connection to the

1020
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,920
internet of course so even though folks

1021
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,200
are basically talking through what is

1022
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,160
by this point an old-school bbs the

1023
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
communication becomes global and your

1024
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,200
messages and emails can get from

1025
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,359
occupied sarajevo

1026
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,839
to new york or ever anywhere else

1027
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,000
within less than 24 hours and this

1028
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
becomes incredibly important for

1029
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,800
basically doing humanitarian work such

1030
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,359
as missing person service so you have

1031
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
hundreds of folks looking for their

1032
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,520
loved ones who may have become refugees

1033
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,400
themselves and this is a truly important

1034
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,520
link

1035
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,240
at this time and it really comes back

1036
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,119
from that initial hobbyist movement that

1037
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,800
originally started by folks trying to

1038
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
build their own computers folks that

1039
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,160
eventually ended up being building their

1040
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,880
bbs's and essentially acquiring the

1041
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
expertise necessary to provide what at

1042
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,440
this point

1043
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,680
is such an important service

1044
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,160
in war

1045
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,720
so what are the lessons of all of this

1046
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,520
i consider making these types of

1047
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,359
comparisons

1048
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,200
very complicated

1049
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
and

1050
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,839
not necessarily

1051
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,240
simple enough as saying

1052
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,560
the sanctions we're seeing right now are

1053
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,359
like

1054
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,760
the embargoes during the cold war that

1055
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,040
is not true

1056
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,760
the needs of folks in occupied

1057
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,560
territories in ukraine are not the same

1058
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,960
as the needs were for folks in these

1059
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,079
other wars these wars are not the same

1060
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,440
however

1061
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,200
i'm going to try to make

1062
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,160
a couple of assumptions and a couple of

1063
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,680
couple of things that maybe can help us

1064
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,079
as we think through this

1065
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,920
when we think about sanctions and we

1066
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,319
think about limitations on import i

1067
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,520
think what we can

1068
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,599
surmise from this story of escrow delta

1069
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,040
from the story of their business in

1070
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
china is

1071
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,520
technology finds a way and countries

1072
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,160
find a way to obtain what they need

1073
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,079
that doesn't mean that

1074
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,760
sanctions are

1075
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
always unjust or that you shouldn't do

1076
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,560
them

1077
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,839
it's just that

1078
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,760
it is quite complicated to make them

1079
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,119
successful

1080
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,599
especially in a world that has different

1081
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,680
types of sort of intermediary

1082
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,200
relationships and countries that are

1083
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,640
sort of in this middle ground status and

1084
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
i think we're seeing that right now

1085
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,880
as a lot of the world

1086
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,680
that is not um aligned and allied with

1087
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
nato directly is sort of taking a middle

1088
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,680
ground uh with sanctions on russia

1089
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,240
when we look at the story of galaxia i

1090
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,359
think

1091
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,079
we see how concepts like

1092
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,040
open source and hacker culture that have

1093
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,119
been associated with

1094
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,040
the silicon valley in america for so

1095
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,440
long they exist everywhere and under

1096
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,839
specific conditions they they really

1097
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,400
come out in in really creative and

1098
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,560
unique ways and

1099
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,359
in a certain way they're no different

1100
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,920
regardless of the system that

1101
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,960
they got

1102
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,440
started and developed in

1103
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,680
and lastly by looking at this story

1104
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,240
about yugoslav networking but especially

1105
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,960
these efforts to connect during the war

1106
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,920
and provide valuable services for people

1107
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,480
impacted by war

1108
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
i think there's something important for

1109
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,319
us to consider about maintaining

1110
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,800
connections with others even during

1111
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,640
times of war

1112
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,000
this is

1113
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,800
hard and emotional especially when we're

1114
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,960
dealing with conflicts where we can

1115
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,839
clearly identify aggressors

1116
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,640
but we have to remember that

1117
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,520
not

1118
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,760
everyone is responsible and the fact

1119
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,319
that someone comes from a country that

1120
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,880
may attack another country does not mean

1121
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,440
that they are the ones doing it

1122
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,520
it's a complicated story

1123
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,200
but i hope that some of these examples

1124
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,920
are interesting enough for you to

1125
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,720
consider them as you as you look at

1126
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,280
news as you look at current events as

1127
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,800
you think about

1128
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,720
what the role of technology can be

1129
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
moving forward and

1130
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,480
how we can all together

1131
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,640
use it for good so

1132
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,520
thank you so much my

1133
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,240
different internet locations are up here

1134
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,599
um i have sort of an obsessive number of

1135
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,599
twitter threads if that is

1136
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,000
um your platform about this and many

1137
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,599
other topics and um lastly i'm going to

1138
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,680
post this on twitter after after the

1139
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,920
talk here is a

1140
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,960
sort of a growing bibliography that can

1141
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,280
help you get started thank you so much

1142
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,119
and i will take any questions you might

1143
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,839
have thanks all

1144
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,640
all right audio questions we have about

1145
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,879
five minutes

1146
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,040
we have at least one question from the

1147
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,960
matrix chat and excuse me for the

1148
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,240
pronunciation greetings from scope j

1149
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,839
how did you come across the information

1150
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,000
for this talk and is there are there any

1151
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,520
interesting media or documentaries you

1152
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,359
could point us to

1153
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,960
yeah thank you so much for this question

1154
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,359
this is actually a great question um

1155
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,920
the information for this talk and um

1156
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,079
again a lot of this is in here but this

1157
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,040
is only a fraction of what i've used um

1158
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,640
a lot of this information is very hard

1159
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,319
to obtain

1160
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,079
the

1161
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,560
most of it comes from um materials in

1162
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,040
serbo creation or bcs bosnian serbian

1163
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,160
creation

1164
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,119
um

1165
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,800
the

1166
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,000
information about yugoslav computing is

1167
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,400
mostly limited to folks who are from

1168
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,680
that country

1169
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,720
and it mostly can be found on obscure

1170
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,040
forums facebook groups but there's a

1171
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,560
couple of exceptions

1172
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,000
so um a good resource to getting started

1173
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,400
is the aforementioned

1174
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,119
retro vashikuchi magazine which you can

1175
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,280
find a copy of in one of these links and

1176
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,880
if you don't speak

1177
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,440
bosnian serbian creation there's also

1178
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,240
this great book by no start press

1179
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,599
there's um

1180
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,000
a couple of documentaries um most

1181
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,760
recently there's been a crowdfunded

1182
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,000
documentary about the galaxy computer in

1183
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,200
particular

1184
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,720
you should just google it galaxy a

1185
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,480
documentary there's a great talk at the

1186
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,040
um ccc probably 2014 that you can find

1187
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,560
on youtube um so it's sort of a mix of

1188
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,480
things uh what i've really been trying

1189
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,599
to do with my work is uh to expand

1190
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,400
access to this by uh almost exclusively

1191
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,480
talking tweeting and writing about it in

1192
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,160
english so i'm hoping more folks can

1193
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,480
access it that way and we can develop

1194
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,319
additional interest and perhaps produce

1195
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,920
some works

1196
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,480
that really summarize this a little bit

1197
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
better than just sort of like going

1198
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,359
through all these loose sources

1199
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,000
so you talked about

1200
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,160
how yugoslavia was a

1201
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,920
importer of western

1202
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,640
technology but i'm curious whether much

1203
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,560
went to the other direction is in its

1204
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,800
status as a sort of intermediary

1205
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,599
did

1206
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,319
the west try to exfiltrate russian or

1207
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,440
eastern bloc tech through yugoslavia

1208
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,520
uh that's a great question um to my

1209
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,920
knowledge um specifically in the realm

1210
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,680
of computing technology that wasn't

1211
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
actually the case

1212
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,640
the primary reason being that yugoslavia

1213
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,960
to my knowledge didn't really get

1214
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,359
any soviet computing technology for you

1215
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,000
know obvious reason that it was really

1216
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,280
at that time quite behind

1217
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,280
it is possible this happened in some

1218
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,040
other areas

1219
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,280
the yugoslavs worked extensively in

1220
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,920
later years in the eastern bloc

1221
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,160
but i'm actually not familiar with any

1222
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,480
cases where for example

1223
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,359
a soviet computer would get to the

1224
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,359
united states through yugoslavia for the

1225
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,680
simple fact that almost no soviet

1226
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,520
computers would actually get

1227
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,119
imported into yugoslavia in the first

1228
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,800
place

1229
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,680
thank you

1230
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,720
yeah thanks for that question

1231
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,559
all right any other questions

1232
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,720
great thank you so much for the talk

1233
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,319
vlado thank you so much everyone
