00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,799
talk so this is all very new to me

52

so

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
my name is alex lind i'm an open source

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
hardware developer and also a cyber

55
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,440
security content creator

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,920
over the past year i've been creating

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,400
cyber security content for the

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,239
youtube show and also

59
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,319
cyber security vendor hack five

60
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,280
i generally create educational

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
tutorials focusing on things like how to

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
use

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
basic hacking tools uh hardware hacking

64
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,640
tools and also

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
some other things in a similar vein to

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
that

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,640
this has been a pretty good a pretty

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
great gig for me

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,159
since i only recently

70
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
started exploring um more cyber security

71
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,239
and infosec

72
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,400
related stuff so oh i guess i'm not

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
presenting

74
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
yes

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
just a sec here cool

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
okay

77
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
so i'm an open source hardware developer

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
and cyber security content creator

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
i've been creating content mostly on the

80
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,000
hack five show where i create

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,640
educational tutorials and walkthroughs

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
for beginners

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,080
so this has been pretty great for me

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
i've been able to teach myself new

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
things and also give back to the

86
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
community and sort of walk people

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
through the process as myself am

88
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,239
learning about some of these things

89
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,480
um

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,159
i come from mostly a background of

91
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,599
hardware and software but over the

92
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,799
course of the past year i've been

93
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
teaching myself

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
more cyber security and infosec related

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,560
stuff and i've sort of been using all

96
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,238
these skills in order to develop the

97
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,358
product that i'm going to be showing you

98
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,639
guys today

99
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,040
so my specialty is mostly with low-cost

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
microcontrollers and also embedded

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
systems i've done things like designed

102
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
iot products i've created

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
stuff around platforms like arduino and

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
espressif that kind of thing and my

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,199
focus is mostly on sustainable design

106
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,720
and signals intelligence which are two

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,199
things that really pique my interest

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,639
microcontrollers in particular are

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,240
really cool i like that they're low cost

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
and they're cheap and i like finding

111
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,479
ways to hack and break stuff with them

112
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,160
and also find new ways to push their

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,280
boundaries

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
to do things which is what we're going

115
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
to be looking at in my project here

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
today

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,360
what are my hobbies

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,240
so as it turns out

119
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,639
i created this presentation last night

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,160
and my friend cody helped me fill out

121

and tell you guys how i ended up in the

131
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
great treasure state and also how i came

132
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,919
to undertake some of these hobbies but

133
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,600
when i'm not rooting to in and shoot in

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
um you can usually find me skateboarding

135
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,639
or practicing piano those are some of my

136
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
other hobbies and here you can see

137
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
when i met my hero bigfoot

138
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
so what is this presentation about so

139
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
i'm gonna first give you guys um some

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,919
context and also um

141
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
sort of some insight to where i came

142
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
from and how i

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
got where i am today i'm gonna talk to

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
you guys about

145
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
um the ideation and the creation process

146
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
of the hardware tool

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,440
called the nugget which is um

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
what my business is about i'm going to

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
talk about how i scale this project

150
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,520
into large scale production and how we

151
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,759
also started selling this through a

152
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
renowned cyber security vendor which is

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,199
hack five i'm also going to tell you

154
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,199
guys about some mistakes that i made in

155
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
this process so hopefully if any of you

156
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
are developers or makers

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,479
you can learn from this and not make the

158
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
same mistakes that i did

159
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,639
so what is the nugget

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,720
so the nugget is a cat shaped board that

161
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
we designed as a tool for beginners to

162
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
teach them about various hacking topics

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
so here you can see um a picture of

164
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,000
actually a naked nugget and it's um

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
enclosure slash case next to it but this

166
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
is um the cat shaped board that we've

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,919
been working on developing the past year

168
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,759
me and my friend cody who's in the

169
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,960
audience

170
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
currently we have two

171
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
splits and variations of this product we

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,960
have a version that's for teaching

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,680
people about usb hacking so stuff like

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
keystroke injection hid attacks that

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
kind of thing

176
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
and then we also have a version of the

177
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
board that's designed to teach beginners

178
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
about wifi hacking

179
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,479
so

180
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,800
my friend cody's background

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,560
is also in low cost microcontrollers

182
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
he's also interested in signals

183
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,039
intelligence

184
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,880
and wi-fi hacking and that kind of thing

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,639
so this was a great overlap for us and

186
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,880
this is why we chose these two topics

187
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
because we find this particularly

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
interesting

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
but besides that the nugget is also a

190
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,319
great beginner soldering kit it's mostly

191
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,599
through whole components there's also

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,880
some surface mount components

193
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,240
and it's also a great beginner

194
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,599
programming tool so actually the other

195
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,560
week in los angeles i hosted a beginner

196
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
soldering workshop featuring the nugget

197
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
from time to time we host

198
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,000
different workshops in different areas

199
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,479
depending on what it is it's sort of

200
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,240
kind of a multi-tool wii

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
um it covers like a wide purview of

202
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,759
things like usb hacking wi-fi hacking

203
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,000
soldering that kind of thing so

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,759
yeah let's dive right in

205
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,879
so first i'm gonna give you guys some

206
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,840
context about myself

207
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,479
um

208
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
i'm gonna go ahead and get started with

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
that

210
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,000
so let's start off with my story how did

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
i get started with hacking so

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
sometime around five years ago

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
when i was in middle school we were

214
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
issued texas instrument calculators and

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,479
if there was anything i wanted to do

216
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,479
in math class it sure as hell wasn't

217
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,000
math so i taught myself how to program

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
using these calculators um

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
using a built-in language i built an

220
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,839
interpreted language on the calculator

221
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,559
and i got started with uh programming

222
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,320
um by teaching myself how to code video

223
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
games

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
um and eventually started selling it to

225
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
kids at school so they also wouldn't

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,680
have to pay attention in dreadful math

227
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,839
class so that's how i got started with

228
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,959
programming and i eventually taught

229
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,800
myself how to hack when

230
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
i wasn't satisfied enough with that i

231
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
started taking apart my calculator i

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,000
taught myself assembly and i started

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
doing harder modifications to it so i

234
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
could do crazy stuff like overclock it

235
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
add built-in wi-fi and a whole bunch of

236
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
other crazy stuff like that

237
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,760
eventually going into high school um

238
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,040
like every beginner i learned about the

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
two basic hardware platforms which were

240
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
arduino and raspberry pi and those

241
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
really piqued my interest so i taught

242
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
myself how to use that i learned a

243
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
little bit about linux

244
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
and i eventually went down the rabbit

245
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
hole of

246
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
learning how to use kali linux and that

247
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,839
kind of thing for nefarious purposes

248
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,360
so at the time i was basically a

249
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
complete beginner to this um

250
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
and i went through the process or i went

251
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
through the struggle rather of trying to

252
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
find great documentation on some of the

253
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
stuff that i was trying to learn

254
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
so once i eventually figured out some of

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,560
the stuff that i was trying to achieve i

256
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,920
figured there would probably be other

257
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,160
beginners out there who are

258
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,360
also trying to learn this kind of stuff

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
so i started creating youtube videos and

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
walkthroughs of

261
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
um

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,600
various topics that i was struggling

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
with

264
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,880
once people started finding these useful

265
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
i started branching out into creating my

266
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
own projects

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,800
some of which you can see here on my

268
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,480
youtube channel that i started

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
and i started developing an interest

270
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
for lower cost boards like arduinos

271
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,519
microcontrollers and that kind of thing

272
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,720
and that's sort of where i gained an

273
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
interest for

274
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,079
signals intelligence

275
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,760
so this is one of my very first projects

276
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,959
um

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,160
if you can see that over here that's

278
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
called the audit pi was basically just a

279
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,839
raspberry pi based platform for signals

280
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,200
intelligence

281
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
and then eventually i started working on

282
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
some more complex projects um using the

283
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
raspberry pi for doing things like

284
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
war skating and also detecting creeps

285
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
which i'll talk about in just a second

286
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
here

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,720
so some of my work one of the first

288
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
projects that i worked on was called the

289
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
creep detector

290
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
so i wish i included more pictures here

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
but i can give you a brief overview what

292
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
this was this is one of the first

293
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
projects that i ever did um

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
and this is also my first signals

295
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
intelligence based projects

296
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
so the basic idea behind this was i

297
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
wanted to

298
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,560
find a way

299
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
or rather the initial idea was how can

300
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,079
we

301
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,920
um

302
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,640
really how to put this

303
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
so the big idea behind this was how can

304
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
you use wardriving to track down someone

305
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
that's stalking you

306
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
so this is my first um signals

307
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
intelligence project um it was raspberry

308
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,440
pi based and it used a program called

309
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,720
kismet which is a wardriving software um

310
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
that's used to gather wi-fi

311
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,279
reconnaissance and basically let you

312
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
create a map of where certain wi-fi

313
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
devices are

314
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
located in proximity to you

315
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,200
so i used a combination of different

316
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,680
tools like python i used linux utilities

317
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
and stuff like that to sort of string

318
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,079
this together

319
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,600
and i was able to create a successful

320
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
proof of concept that let me determine

321
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
if someone was stalking you

322
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
by analyzing this data and seeing if

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
the presence of certain devices like

324
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,680
cell phones or laptops are detected at

325
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
multiple gps points

326
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
um in a certain path that you travel

327
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,800
some of my other work i didn't get to

328
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,279
expand these into new slides

329
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,120
but these are some of my other projects

330
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,639
that i've worked on related to signals

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,399
intelligence and also some of my other

332
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,399
interests like sustainability

333
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,920
the probe hunter was my first

334
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,000
commissioned device

335
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,279
that i created entirely using

336
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,800
microcontrollers

337
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,120
so this was um

338
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
commissioned to me by a client who had a

339
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
strange request to

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,959
create a device to help him track down a

341
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
cell phone that he lost in the forest

342
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
so the way i ended up solving this

343
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
problem was pretty novel um we'll take a

344
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,000
look at this more in just a second here

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,040
but i basically uh created a

346
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,639
wi-fi device that looked for the

347
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
emissions of a particular type of wi-fi

348
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
packet called a probe frame which is

349
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
sent out by phones and laptops and other

350
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,760
things like that when they're searching

351
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,720
for previously connected wifi devices

352
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
i created a device that was able to

353
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
sniff for that and basically look for

354
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,200
the emissions of

355
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
these particular types of wi-fi packets

356
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
and i helped him create a device that

357
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,160
was able to track down the physical

358
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
presence of his cell phone even though

359
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,839
it was turned off and lost in an

360
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,279
arbitrary place

361
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,839
pylar was another project that i started

362
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,839
sometime in high school which was

363
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
basically an ai powered composter

364
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,959
this is my first project doing full

365
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,279
stack embedded development i created a

366
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
web application for this there was a

367
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
combination of hardware involved and

368
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
also software development

369
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
and then sometime towards the end of

370
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,279
high school

371
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,600
i was commissioned with a crazy ass

372
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
project

373
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,240
um

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,560
called crypto for gas where

375
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,959
basically i was proposed to create a

376
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,079
mesh network at gas stations that allows

377
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,320
um truckers to just roll in and

378
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,079
automatically have their gas paid for

379
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
using

380
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
cryptocurrency so that way they wouldn't

381
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
have to actually get out of their trucks

382
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,880
so this is a really interesting proof of

383
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,959
concept that helped me really develop

384
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
skills in really weird areas that all

385
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,880
eventually tied together and helped me

386
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,160
create the project that i'm going to be

387
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,519
showing you guys in a little which is

388
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,639
the nugget

389
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,240
but i got to explore a lot of

390
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,519
interesting things like mesh networking

391
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,320
various niche areas of the wi-fi

392
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,399
protocol hardware development and stuff

393
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,800
like that

394
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,200
so towards the end of high school

395
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,040
[Music]

396
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,440
i had found at the very last minute that

397
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,560
i was one of the only people in my class

398
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,440
to have not applied um to colleges

399
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,079
towards the very end

400
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,600
so i was kind of in this weird gray area

401
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
where i didn't really know what i wanted

402
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,199
to do but i was working on all these

403
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
other projects that i had distracted

404
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,199
myself with throughout all these years

405
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,560
and i realized that i didn't really want

406
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
to go to college i really didn't know

407
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,399
what was right for me

408
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,800
and that also staying at home also

409
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,240
wasn't an option for me because i didn't

410
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,079
want to become complacent and since my

411
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,720
home life kind of sucked so what did i

412
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
do instead i decided to start my own

413
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,240
company sort of this ended up not going

414
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,920
so great but i started lind labs which

415
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,319
was

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,199
basically just a little project where i

417
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
started advertising some of the things i

418
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,079
do i showed people some of the projects

419
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,360
i was working on i received a few

420
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,560
commissions but it wasn't enough to

421
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,120
sustain myself or move out

422
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,839
but at this point um one of my friends

423
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
cody said hey why don't you come out

424
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
here to montana for a few weeks

425
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,199
and

426
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
you can stack some video content help

427
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,720
create videos for us

428
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
at the time

429
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,519
he was working at hack five so

430
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
he offered that i could come out there

431
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,600
and make a couple videos um stack a

432
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,880
little bit of money and then move back

433
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
and decide what to do so i thought oh

434
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,079
this is a great idea maybe i'll do that

435
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,639
and hopefully have a more

436
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,399
elucidated or like clear path at that

437
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,639
point so i decided to come out there for

438
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,560
two weeks over the summer to figure out

439
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,720
what i wanted to do but as a contingency

440
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
plan i also applied for community

441
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
college

442
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,839
just in case

443
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,279
but then also

444
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,399
it happened to coincide with

445
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
oh yeah but then on top of that um

446
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,519
actually i'm gonna go ahead and move on

447
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,839
to the next slide

448
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,040
so on top of moving out there um

449
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,959
he also proposed

450
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,518
sorry i'll need a second

451
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,770
so on top of moving out there um

452
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,160
[Music]

453
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,519
at the time my friend cody was working

454
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,360
on developing another hardware platform

455
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,800
with one of his friends

456
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,279
which ended up um not working out so he

457
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,120
had a bunch of extra microcontrollers

458
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,360
and also components on hand that we

459
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
needed to figure out what to do with

460
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
so i decided to help him out since i had

461
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,240
some experience developing hardware

462
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,759
to basically just create a kit or

463
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,199
something like that to sell all of these

464
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,400
extra components

465
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
and basically take these off his hands

466
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,439
so

467
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,000
just a

468
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
spoiler alert of how this ended up

469
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
turning out those two weeks ended up

470
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,720
becoming a whole year

471
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,319
and this fun little project to get rid

472
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,000
of some extra components that we had on

473
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,839
hand ended up turning into a

474
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,720
high-intensity startup that now consumes

475
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,880
most of our available time um

476
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,640
and turned into this huge logistics game

477
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
and also development game for us over

478
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,840
the course of this past year which i'll

479
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,799
be telling you guys about

480
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,559
so this was the initial design that we

481
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,640
came up with um

482
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
so basically my friend had a stockpile

483
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
of wi-fi microcontrollers and also

484
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
screens from a previous project

485
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
and we needed to figure out what to do

486
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
with all of these components so we

487
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,720
created this design that we called the

488
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
hack hat we basically just slapped

489
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
everything we had onto this board here

490
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
and we figured that eventually at some

491
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,039
point

492
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,720
we could come up with a more clear idea

493
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
of what the product would actually do

494
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
but that in the meantime it would just

495
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,320
support community-based products and

496
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
that it was a beginner soldering kit so

497
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,840
at this point we actually

498
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,559
um

499
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,559
we worked with some other uh platforms

500
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,000
before like arduino and that kind of

501
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,799
thing and we hosted um

502
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,080
we posted some things like beginner

503
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,000
soldering workshops so just as an

504
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
initial idea we decided to create this

505
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
little beginner soldering kit where

506
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
people can throw on a screen a

507
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
microcontroller and buttons into this

508
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
gameboy-esque fact form factor

509
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
even though we didn't really have any

510
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,120
software or anything to run on this

511
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
but um just to sort of spice things up

512
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
we also made it catboy themed as you can

513
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,559
see in this picture over here

514
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,520
so this is where we made our first

515
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,760
mistake so let's talk about this so this

516
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,919
section is called why all in one

517
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,000
hardware platform suck this is the slide

518
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,919
was initially titled why your all-in-one

519
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
hardware platform suck but after getting

520
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
some feedback on this

521
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,480
um some friends told me that was a

522
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,559
little bit controversial since i'm sure

523
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,320
at some point almost every maker has had

524
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
the idea to create a hardware multi-tool

525
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
but that's the exact point that i want

526
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
to address with this part here this is

527
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
the first mistake that we made with

528
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
developing this product

529
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,520
so we basically jumped right in um

530
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
to just creating a hardware platform

531
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
with no clear idea of what we wanted to

532
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
do with it all we had was just a bunch

533
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,200
of spare components on hand and we threw

534
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,280
it onto this board and we decided oh

535
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,600
since there's a bunch of free resources

536
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
out there like arduino circuit python

537
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
and that kind of thing we can create the

538
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,280
hardware platform and basically just

539
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,720
have people figure out what to do with

540
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
this tool since there's already so many

541
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,440
community resources available and

542
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
i've actually seen this play out a lot

543
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,600
of times i personally have friends who

544
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,280
have tried to create platforms like this

545
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,720
where they'll

546
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,799
um just create like a general multi-tool

547
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
that's like a bunch of expansion kits or

548
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,559
sensors or like that kind of thing and

549
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,400
they expect people to

550
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
figure out what to do with it based off

551
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,520
community resources that are already out

552
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,280
there and that's the first big mistake

553
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
that we made with developing this

554
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,360
project

555
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
so the first reason why this is a bad

556
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,799
idea is if you're developing a

557
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,400
multi-tool or something that's trying to

558
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
appeal to everyone that doesn't really

559
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
work out since you're really the only

560
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,640
one who understands how this product

561
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
works

562
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
the problem is if you're trying to sell

563
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,039
this as an actual consumer product or

564
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,480
something that people want to buy if

565
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,919
it's a multi-tool people aren't really

566
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,440
going to know what to do with it they

567
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
don't have a clear-cut idea and um it's

568
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
just hard to figure out you can't really

569
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,919
just throw this into people's hands and

570
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,120
expect them to figure out what to do

571
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,799
with it if it's a multi-tool

572
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,159
like this random product that i found

573
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,679
here that's supposed to be an all-in-one

574
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,039
hardware platform i don't know what the

575
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,520
hell that's for

576
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
and also more issues come later down the

577
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
line when you're actually trying to

578
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
develop this into a full-fledged product

579
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
because if everything is a feature you

580
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,480
can't

581
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,440
really

582
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,760
figure out like um

583
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,200
what features need to be improved upon

584
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
so there's just so much to manage and

585
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,039
there's not really much room to improve

586
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,840
so let's take a look at the first failed

587
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,039
product that i tried to create this is

588
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,400
probe hunter which i talked a little bit

589
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,080
about earlier

590
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
hopefully i can elucidate a little more

591
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,679
clearly what it does so this was the

592
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,840
very first device that i was

593
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,559
commissioned so basically um some random

594
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,400
person hit me up and said hey i lost my

595
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
cell phone in a forest do you have any

596
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,320
idea how i can track this thing down

597
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,080
so at the time i knew a little bit about

598
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
signals intelligence um

599
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
and i knew a little bit about how the

600
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
wi-fi protocol worked so i said all

601
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,039
right well basically your phone is

602
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,880
locked it's turned off it's presumably

603
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
somewhere out there

604
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
we can use um wi-fi in order to track

605
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
down this device by looking for a

606
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,640
particular type of wi-fi packet that

607
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,159
your phone will still be emitting even

608
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,280
though it's off

609
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
and that type of wi-fi packet is called

610
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,400
a pro request so basically

611
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,960
wi-fi devices when they're attempting to

612
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
connect to previously joined networks

613
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,760
they'll send out something called a

614
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
probe request to look for these networks

615
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,200
they'll shout the names out and hope

616
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,039
that they spot one of them so i created

617
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,280
this device that specifically sniffed

618
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,799
for probe requests i called it the probe

619
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,600
hunter and once it latched on to one of

620
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
these requests

621
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
it used the signal strength or rather it

622
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,960
would

623
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
start tracking the signal strength and

624
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
it used a directional antenna in order

625
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,520
to pinpoint the exact location so it was

626
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
a pretty crazy proof of concept turns

627
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,679
out the guy was able to use it to find

628
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,440
lost cell phones that were in waterproof

629
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,840
bags inside of a local river which is

630
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
interesting and he ended up sending me

631
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,280
my first cell phone because i was poor

632
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,400
and didn't have a phone so that was

633
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
pretty cool

634
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
um

635
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
so that was the first project that i

636
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
created

637
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,720
but

638
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,120
eventually i decided that i wanted this

639
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
to be more than just that i wanted this

640
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,440
to be a wi-fi multi-tool for doing a lot

641
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
of other things i wanted to i wanted it

642
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,360
to be able to do stuff like war driving

643
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
general purpose wifi reconnaissance and

644
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,440
i also wanted it to be just a

645
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,919
general-purpose iot multi-tool that can

646
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
be used for

647
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,480
really anything that's based off of

648
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
wi-fi so i started adding a bunch of

649
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
bells and whistles and unnecessary

650
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,919
features to it because i decided that

651
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,919
that's what people would want

652
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,679
um so i started slapping random things

653
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,360
on there like an sd card reader i

654
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,679
slapped on a gps and a bunch of other

655
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,919
random features and the issue with this

656
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,760
was that it was trying to solve multiple

657
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,159
unrelated problems in a single design

658
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,000
so once i started trying to actually

659
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,679
sell this product i got a lot i got a

660
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,679
lot of questions asking just like what

661
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,720
does it do

662
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,000
because it was no longer for a single

663
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
purpose and it was just really confusing

664
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,840
as to what it's actually used for

665
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
that being said modularity and

666
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
extensibility aren't entirely discounted

667
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
though

668
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
as i mentioned in a previous slide since

669
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,480
you are the only one who knows

670
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,080
how this multi-tool works if that's what

671
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
you're working with then you're the one

672
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
who knows the ins and out of the

673
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,840
features and if you're working on

674
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
projects that are just for yourself

675
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,279
then that's okay like for example this

676
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,799
was another project that i worked on

677
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,880
this is actually one of the prototypes

678
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,960
for the crazy crypto for gas

679
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,159
project

680
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,080
that was i was also commissioned since

681
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,520
the client didn't really care about the

682
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,279
underlying hardware

683
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,600
um i was able to use my crazy um

684
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,679
all-in-one iot hardware platform which

685
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,640
was

686
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
as you can see the exact same circuit

687
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
board here is being used as one of these

688
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,200
nodes i was able to reuse that um as the

689
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
underlying hardware for this project

690
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
so in this case um this is okay since

691
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,279
i'm the only one who knew what was going

692
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,279
on under the hood and since the client

693
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,880
didn't really care about that it wasn't

694
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,000
something that i was trying to sell to

695
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,919
the general public it was a specific

696
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,880
application and i was able to personally

697
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
use this multi-tool so in some cases

698
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
it's okay to add extensibility if it's

699
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,279
for a personal project that's what i

700
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,520
found

701
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,159
so there were some um

702
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,520
design choices that i made which

703
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,440
serendipitously ended up working out

704
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
great for me

705
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,159
in terms of the components that i

706
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,640
selected one of them um

707
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
which ended up being persistently great

708
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,360
is this particular wi-fi microcontroller

709
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,240
called the d1 mini so on the top here

710
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,840
you can see

711
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,440
this little board that has a wifi chip

712
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,520
attached to it that's called the d1 mini

713
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,679
so um that's basically the wi-fi chip

714
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,039
that i

715
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,400
chose in order to unify all these

716
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
projects it's really great it's small it

717
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,159
comes with a lot of plug-and-play

718
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,320
modules like this sd card reader they

719
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
also have some other add-on sensors and

720
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
stuff like that that actually plug in

721
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
directly to these boards so when i was

722
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,400
designing this um when i was designing

723
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,159
these platforms with extensibility and

724
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
modularity in mind

725
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
um

726
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,320
i chose this particular form factor

727
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,480
since it offered me the most flexibility

728
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,919
and i thought like oh if other users

729
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,520
pick up this platform and want to add

730
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,799
more stuff to it

731
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,400
then this is the perfect form factor

732
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,080
since they can slap on something like a

733
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
micro sd card for saving data they can

734
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,760
slap on temperature sensors or other

735
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,400
stuff like that

736
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,400
and

737
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
it turns out this ended up being the

738
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
base module that we used in the product

739
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,440
that we're selling today

740
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,360
just by complete chance

741
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,679
so let's look at the first case study of

742
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,480
a company that actually um

743
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,240
gets the idea right so first we're gonna

744
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
look at hack five products which is

745
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
where we're currently selling the nugget

746
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
product

747
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,559
so the reason why i think hack five

748
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,480
has got their business model down right

749
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
is each of their devices is single

750
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,880
purpose it's clear-cut and you can

751
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,960
basically explain what each of them does

752
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,919
in

753
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,240
a one-sentence elevator pitch like for

754
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
example the usb rubber ducky it's an

755
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,080
inconspicuous usb attack platform it

756
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,679
looks like a usb you plug it into

757
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,279
someone's computer since it just looks

758
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,039
like a flash drive but then it starts

759
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,520
attacking them and runs keystrokes

760
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,080
you have the um

761
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,679
i actually forget what that one's called

762
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,960
but basically

763
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,279
what was that

764
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,480
i don't think that was the land turtle i

765
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,159
know the top one's the plunder bug but

766
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,080
that one's like a man in the middle um

767
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
for ethernet and then the bottom one i

768
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
think is the packet squirrel

769
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,360
which is used for also deploying packets

770
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,159
but

771
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,400
basically hack five um does this thing

772
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,480
where they segment all of their products

773
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,799
into different specific use cases they

774
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,480
have stuff for attacking wi-fi they have

775
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,720
stuff for usb attacks that kind of thing

776
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,000
and i think they really get that right

777
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
because when a beginner

778
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,679
comes and sees these products it's

779
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,440
really easy for them to differentiate

780
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,120
between them and choose which one they

781
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,039
need for their specific application if

782
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,720
you present them a

783
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,960
multi-faceted multi-tool

784
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,799
that's sort of ambiguous they really

785
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,000
won't know what the hell to do with it

786
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,120
they're going to have a hard time

787
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
understanding and coming up with their

788
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,919
own ideas

789
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,440
when there's just so much to choose from

790
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,559
i think that's one thing that hack five

791
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,679
gets right

792
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,960
and

793
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,640
also just some insider information that

794
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
we have about like hack five products

795
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,399
under the hood lots of them actually

796
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,200
have almost the exact same hardware

797
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,799
but in order to

798
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,600
um sort of package this way and

799
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,039
in order to sort of

800
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,640
package these products in a way that

801
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
customers can understand

802
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
they basically take that hardware slap

803
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,840
it into a new form factor and then

804
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,559
basically sell it with um

805
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,399
like a new big idea behind like what the

806
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,279
product actually does

807
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,600
the second reason why i feel like

808
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,080
all-in-one hardware platforms are kind

809
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,440
of a bad idea

810
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,960
is

811
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720
you need to decide the skill level that

812
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,399
you're trying to appeal to

813
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,279
so there's basically three tiers of

814
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,480
custom

815
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
okay i'll get to that in a second

816
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,679
there's basically three tiers of people

817
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,440
there's people who are beginners in the

818
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,000
space um there's people who are kind of

819
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,360
intermediate they're tech literate

820
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,840
they're familiar with um

821
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,279
technical jargon that kind of stuff and

822
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,960
then there's advanced people

823
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,440
when you're trying to sell to beginners

824
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,480
i find that if you're trying to sell

825
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,159
them a multi-tool they'll generally get

826
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,919
lost which i just mentioned

827
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,279
if you're trying to sell to advanced

828
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,000
users i find that generally they don't

829
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,320
want multi-tools since they

830
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,840
generally there's a trade-off between

831
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,520
functionality and how much stuff is

832
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,760
actually packaged into one product

833
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,919
but typically the kind of users that i

834
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:04,640
see

835
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,880
eating up or consuming these actual

836
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,960
products are intermediate users who

837
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
think they want an all-in-one tool but

838
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,559
end up getting lost once they realize

839
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,320
that they're hit with hard limitations

840
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,200
so let's look at an interesting

841
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
device which i'm sure some of you guys

842
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,159
might have heard of called the flipper

843
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,360
zero

844
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,679
so this is a really novel product um

845
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,840
it's essentially a multi-tool for

846
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,120
exploring

847
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,080
um

848
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,600
penetration testing or like hardware

849
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
testing with multiple different wireless

850
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,720
protocols

851
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,039
so this is a really interesting device

852
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,399
there's been a lot of hype that's been

853
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,720
built up around this over the course of

854
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,159
i think maybe

855
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,919
two or three years now

856
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,600
but this is a really cute form factor

857
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
it's a gamified device

858
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,720
that's meant to allow people to hack and

859
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,039
screw around with multiple types of

860
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,520
wireless protocols

861
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
so this is really cool it's really cute

862
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
it's beginner-friendly it's something

863
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,279
that you can pick up and

864
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,279
understand pretty intuitively one thing

865
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,640
that i think

866
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,240
um

867
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
they went wrong with was

868
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,919
well actually they do have great

869
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,440
developer documentation but one thing

870
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
that i think

871
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
sort of left some users of this product

872
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,960
disappointed was the fact that there's

873
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
poor use case documentation so

874
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,159
essentially they dumped this product

875
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,799
into the hands of multiple customers

876
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,640
and

877
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,240
i just find that a lot of beginners were

878
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
actually

879
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
actually kind of like shied away from

880
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,880
using this product once they realized

881
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
like they didn't actually know what to

882
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,919
do with all of these capabilities

883
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,200
there's a lot of interesting features

884
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
packed into this like um

885
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,720
stuff for sub gigahertz hacking radio um

886
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,399
i forgot what other uh frequencies are

887
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,440
in there i think there's like wi-fi

888
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,279
bluetooth and stuff like that

889
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,200
but it was a really novel idea um to

890
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,640
have this like all-in-one tool that

891
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,080
could do a whole bunch of other attacks

892
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,919
oh yeah there's also like rfid attacks

893
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,200
nfc

894
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,279
um that kind of thing and there are some

895
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,200
proof of concepts out there

896
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
where i've seen this used in situations

897
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,440
for like opening up garage doors or like

898
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
tesla charging ports or cool stuff like

899
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
that

900
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,519
um

901
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,960
but it's typically like more advanced

902
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
users that are like figuring out how to

903
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,279
do these hacks and it just like

904
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,039
falls completely deaf to like beginners

905
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,880
who don't really know how to use this

906
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,200
thing so i found like some beginners

907
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
that ended up with this product were a

908
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,760
little bit disappointed

909
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,060
so we ended up um

910
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,519
[Music]

911
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,120
not taking any of that advice because we

912
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
didn't learn that at this point so once

913
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
we started um

914
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
developing our platforms

915
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,960
once we started developing the hack hat

916
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,519
platform um we personally found

917
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,880
ourselves kind of lost and didn't really

918
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,480
know what to do with it so we had the

919
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
grand idea of

920
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,679
deciding to create more form factors

921
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,440
so in addition to creating the hack hat

922
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,840
um we decided to also create this other

923
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
board here called the long cat which was

924
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,480
basically a battery-powered version

925
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,120
but we still faced the issue where both

926
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,640
of these were just general multi-tools

927
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,080
and we ended up creating a second

928
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
iteration that was battery powered and

929
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,880
portable

930
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,720
and

931
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,600
basically did nothing at this point

932
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,440
except run community-based projects

933
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,360
and then we came up with a joke idea to

934
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,120
repackage this platform

935
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,760
into a small cat-shaped conference badge

936
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,120
that people could just carry around on a

937
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,039
lanyard or something like that

938
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,080
and we discovered a interesting project

939
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,519
called the wi-fi the author which is

940
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,200
made by an independent maker called

941
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,760
space moon but basically this is um

942
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,080
a wi-fi hacking platform that runs on

943
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,640
the wi-fi chip that we have on this

944
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,039
board here and we flash it to our board

945
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,440
it worked with the built-in buttons i

946
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
should probably charge my laptop so it

947
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
doesn't die

948
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,600
it worked with the built-in buttons that

949
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,919
we had on here and it was a pretty

950
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,799
intuitive interface um

951
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,240
that lets you run wi-fi hacks and that

952
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,600
kind of thing and it was an instant hit

953
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
once we started um

954
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,799
showing this off on twitter and that

955
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,919
kind of thing people were really

956
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,679
interested to see this package into a

957
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,919
cat shaped form factor and people also

958
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,039
found it really cool that this thing

959
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
could be used for wi-fi hacking

960
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,120
so while this

961
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,880
sort of ditched the initial idea of

962
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,399
having like a beginner soldering kit

963
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,799
since there were now some smd components

964
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,960
the cat theme and cap shaped board ended

965
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,360
up being a hit so we decided to focus on

966
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,600
that

967
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,799
and this was also the initial

968
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,640
ideation and the initial design for the

969
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,039
product

970
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,760
and then also

971
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
in the initial creation process we went

972
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,880
through

973
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,799
quite a few interesting design choices

974
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,600
like the wifi penis which for obvious

975
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,120
reasons ended up being rejected

976
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,880
so at this point um

977
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,559
we had an interesting dichotomy or i

978
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,799
guess in this case whatever three

979
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,399
different boards are so we had three

980
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,240
different um form factors for this

981
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,919
product we have the wi-fi nugget the hat

982
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,919
cat and the long cat

983
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,000
and still no clear-cut purpose or goal

984
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
for what these products would do we

985
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,360
figured hey we have a hardware platform

986
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
let's put this in the hands of people i

987
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,079
guess they'll figure out what to do with

988
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,760
it since there's already

989
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,040
um

990
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,480
stuff that stuff that's out there that

991
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,839
supports this like arduino and that kind

992
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,918
of thing

993
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,599
so we identified we eventually

994
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,520
identified the need to come up with a

995
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,759
big unifying idea to solve this product

996
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,159
and these are the reasons why so um

997
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,879
in order to have a big idea and in order

998
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,440
to um actually sell this product

999
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,800
it comes down to four um

1000
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,159
i think basically four points that we've

1001
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,159
identified over the course of just

1002
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,079
experimenting the past year you need a

1003
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,000
no-nonsense clear elevator pitch that

1004
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,440
you can use in order to explain what the

1005
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,119
product does if you're telling someone

1006
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,639
this is a multi-tool that you can use

1007
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,719
for wi-fi hacking for

1008
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,800
a beginner soldering kit and for

1009
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
prototyping with electronics that

1010
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,680
doesn't really fly it needs to be able

1011
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,599
to stand on its own and

1012
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
have a more clear-cut goal kind of like

1013
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,560
the hack five products that i pitched

1014
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,720
earlier it needs to have cohesive

1015
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,560
branding and also something that makes

1016
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,040
it unique from competitors so also

1017
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,160
another thing

1018
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,720
that i see falling flat sometimes is

1019
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,640
stuff like beginner soldering kits

1020
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,000
that's something that we also learned

1021
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
very early on marketing this as

1022
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,400
something that basically everything

1023
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,680
something that basically everyone else

1024
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,839
was trying to do didn't really fly but

1025
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,359
the one

1026
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,599
the one one up that we had over other

1027
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,040
people that were trying to sell stuff

1028
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,920
was

1029
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,760
serendipitously the

1030
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,240
cat the cat themed and cat-shaped

1031
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,439
platform that we decided on

1032
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,839
so the first month of

1033
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
so now i'm going to sort of um

1034
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,640
delineate and walk you guys through the

1035
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
development cycle and also how we

1036
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,560
actually brought this product to market

1037
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,640
you know if i have power

1038
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,760
so in the first month we quickly

1039
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,359
identified that keeping up with all

1040
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,560
three hardware platforms that we

1041
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
developed even as cool and promising as

1042
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
they seemed was a terrible idea so the

1043
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,160
first thing we did was we decided to

1044
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,839
drop the other two platforms the hakka

1045
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,680
and the long cat since most people were

1046
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
interested in this cat shaped board and

1047
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,320
since it seemed to have the most promise

1048
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,760
so we doubled down on this and we

1049
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,599
decided we're different from all of our

1050
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,200
other competitors who are also making

1051
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,359
beginner soldering kits what we have

1052
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,119
here is an absolute score it's a

1053
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,880
beginner wi-fi multi-tool it does

1054
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,119
everything it's a beginner soldering kit

1055
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
it does wi-fi hacking you can do

1056
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,400
hardware development you can program on

1057
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
it whatever you want

1058
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,480
terrible idea by the way

1059
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,240
so before we actually decided that we

1060
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,520
wanted to focus on the nugget we

1061
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,040
actually ran through a couple

1062
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,680
painstaking iterations of the other

1063
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,839
harder platforms the hack hat and the

1064
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,359
long cat up here

1065
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,440
worked on some more designs where we

1066
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
sort of experimented with the form

1067
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,640
factor we tried different breakout

1068
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,400
modules and stuff like that but then

1069
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,920
eventually gave that up once we decided

1070
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,160
the nugget was what we're sticking with

1071
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,680
so come around to month two we

1072
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,879
eventually um

1073
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,800
we made some improvements to the

1074
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,280
platform we had a second version of the

1075
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,440
nugget and we sort of

1076
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,760
um decided to lean into the wi-fi

1077
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,200
hacking aspects and some people were

1078
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,960
interested in the author project that we

1079
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,400
were showing off

1080
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,200
so on the hack five um show at this time

1081
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
i was already creating some beginner um

1082
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
content for things like hacking with

1083
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
like linux tools and that kind of thing

1084
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,800
and we decided to just show this off as

1085
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,640
a little project video on the show and

1086
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,400
this is the first uh project that i did

1087
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
which was detecting wi-fi attacks on the

1088
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,800
wi-fi nugget that's what we decided to

1089
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
call it

1090
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
so um turns out a lot of people were

1091
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,079
really interested in this um they liked

1092
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,920
the beginner demonstration they liked

1093
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,160
the hardware that i was showing off

1094
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,200
and um

1095
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,440
we actually made our first sale within

1096
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,880
minutes of posting the video

1097
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,079
oh yeah and then in terms of development

1098
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,640
i started focusing on the

1099
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,280
um using it as a wi-fi hacking tool

1100
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,200
while my friend cody also simultaneously

1101
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,599
worked on developing um more programming

1102
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,160
oriented stuff with micropython

1103
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,000
somewhere around the third month of

1104
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,240
developing this uh product we got a

1105
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,640
little more community feedback on this

1106
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,560
tool um it was in the hands of more

1107
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,079
people i'd say somewhere around 100

1108
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,160
people started using this thing

1109
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
um it still didn't really have

1110
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,640
let me check the time

1111
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,640
move

1112
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,920
so we didn't really have um our own

1113
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,079
uh

1114
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,520
like idea for this project we were still

1115
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,440
running community-based uh tools on this

1116
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,760
but we started hosting our first few

1117
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,000
workshops around the la area featuring

1118
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,400
this tool it was still a multi-tool so

1119
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
we were doing random things wherever we

1120
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
could we were teaching python with it we

1121
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,520
were teaching wi-fi hacking and even

1122
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,480
soldering classes

1123
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,560
come around to month four of this

1124
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
project floating out there we still

1125
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
didn't have our own independent software

1126
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
but i was leaning more heavily in

1127
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,440
towards why into wi-fi hacking since it

1128
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,200
seemed that a lot of people were picking

1129
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,040
up on um

1130
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,800
this particular subject and a lot of

1131
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,720
people were interested in a low-cost

1132
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,640
tool that could do that since typically

1133
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,760
um if you're getting started with like

1134
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,680
wi-fi hacking or that kind of thing

1135
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,040
you'll need like

1136
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
um a fancy like setup on linux you'll

1137
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,480
need like a wi-fi dongle or something

1138
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,920
like that but with the board that we

1139
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,680
were selling anybody could do it with a

1140
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
low-cost microcontroller and it was also

1141
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,000
cute and plus we were programming um

1142
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,119
beginner

1143
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,640
friendly like graphics and a little

1144
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,800
interface for it

1145
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,160
but come around this time um

1146
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,079
both me and my friend were sort of

1147
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,359
developing this product in two different

1148
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,119
ways i was focusing more on the hacking

1149
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,640
aspect whereas my friend was taking it

1150
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,040
more towards a programming route

1151
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,720
so my friend started looking into um

1152
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,560
programming with micro python and

1153
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,400
circuit python

1154
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
to see where we could take it with

1155
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,119
beginners that were trying to get

1156
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,160
started with programming

1157
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,480
and right at this time the developers of

1158
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
the d1 mini form factor happen to come

1159
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,400
out with a new form factor

1160
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,480
called the s2 mini which happened to be

1161
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,319
the exact same form factor and shape of

1162
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,400
our previous wi-fi module but the thing

1163
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
is this had some one-ups over the

1164
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,079
previous module and that it was faster

1165
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,520
at usbc

1166
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
it could um

1167
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,880
it was dual core it could run like a

1168
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,960
whole bunch of cool applications and it

1169
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
supported a

1170
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,160
version of python that was really cool

1171
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
called circuit python unfortunately it

1172
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
didn't support

1173
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,079
wi-fi attacks though

1174
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,359
so we ended up creating two splits of

1175
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,880
this product

1176
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,079
i'm a little bit rushed for time so i

1177
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,000
might have to skip some slides

1178
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,079
so we ended up creating um two splits of

1179
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,520
this product so you can see that we

1180
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,040
dropped the hat cat and the long cat and

1181
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,839
the wi-fi nugget um we decided to rename

1182
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,680
to the d1 wifi nugget which is kind of

1183
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,040
confusing and then we had this new

1184
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,960
player called the s2 wifi nugget and

1185
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,560
this is sort of where we started facing

1186
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,480
branding issues because now people were

1187
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
extra confused as to what the hell this

1188
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,720
product was for now that we had two kind

1189
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
of arbitrarily named and confusingly

1190
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,560
named products and also since we were

1191
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,160
taking these in two different directions

1192
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,760
i was focusing on how to use it as a

1193
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,839
hacking tool whereas my friend cody was

1194
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,920
exploring um some more stuff in

1195
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,599
programming and that kind of thing and

1196
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,800
we were trying to find something to

1197
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,119
unify these all together so now we had a

1198
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,040
split of the product a split of these

1199
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,720
two products where

1200
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,800
i was focusing more on the d1 platform

1201
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,640
and my friend was focusing on the s2

1202
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,480
platform

1203
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,720
around um the fourth or fifth month of

1204
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,079
developing

1205
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
we decided to just start selling this on

1206
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
our own store so now we were selling two

1207
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,839
products but this led to inevitable

1208
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,960
confusion

1209
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,240
where people were confused about um

1210
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
which one to buy they didn't really

1211
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,119
understand the distinctions between the

1212
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,480
two products

1213
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,119
um also the issue with the s2 module

1214
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,440
that we ran into was that um the newer

1215
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,599
version of the software development kit

1216
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,680
didn't support like wi-fi attacks

1217
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
so some people were buying this module

1218
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,200
that was better at programming but not

1219
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,960
wi-fi hacking thinking they could do the

1220
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,319
same thing and they ended up getting a

1221
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,760
little bit pissed

1222
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,359
so now we had this interesting dichotomy

1223
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,040
we had this naming confusion and people

1224
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,640
still didn't really have a clear idea of

1225
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,359
what this product was for

1226
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,240
so at that point we decided we needed a

1227
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,680
piece of software that was completely

1228
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,760
our own something that we could create

1229
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,680
our own elevator pitch for and something

1230
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,280
that was strongly associated with our

1231
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,640
product because at this point we were

1232
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,800
running mostly community-based projects

1233
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,480
like circuit python like the author and

1234
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,160
that kind of thing so that's where we

1235
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,000
came up with the idea for the nugget

1236
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,440
invader this was supposed to be a piece

1237
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,760
of software that runs on the wi-fi

1238
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,720
nugget

1239
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,960
and it was designed to be a wi-fi

1240
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,240
hacking tool

1241
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,520
at first it was designed to be an

1242
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
all-in-one tool for things like network

1243
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,079
attacks and also network defense

1244
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,200
where it could do things like boot

1245
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,440
people off wi-fi networks

1246
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,040
as well as also detect network threats

1247
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,759
and that kind of thing

1248
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,200
as you can see we didn't really learn

1249
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,880
from or i didn't learn from my mistake

1250
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,040
initially where i tried to still create

1251
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,319
this software thing as like an

1252
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,240
all-in-one tool

1253
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,520
but we eventually broke this out into

1254
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,960
two projects called the invader and the

1255
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,760
defender the first one being a network

1256
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,960
attack tool the second one being a

1257
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,880
defense tool but it was still kind of

1258
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,480
confusing since these were software

1259
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,000
based projects

1260
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,480
that could be run on the d1 nugget and

1261
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,920
since circuit python was the programming

1262
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,079
language that we were running on the s2

1263
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,160
nugget so there was even more brand

1264
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,640
confusion that was caused around this

1265
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,720
and people were conflating our software

1266
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,319
with the hardware names and they still

1267
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,480
had problems differentiating between the

1268
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,359
two platforms that we created

1269
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,480
i'm gonna go ahead and skip through

1270
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,880
these ones a little bit

1271
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,400
eventually we came to an interesting

1272
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,560
point where the s2 nugget ended up we

1273
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,880
ended up pivoting towards the s2 version

1274
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
of the nugget once we realized

1275
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,079
that one of the cool features it

1276
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,000
supported was the ability to run usb

1277
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
attacks since we were selling mostly to

1278
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,359
the hack five audience and since their

1279
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,520
gig was mostly um

1280
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,440
is mostly usb hot plug attacks and that

1281
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,000
kind of thing we decided to develop a um

1282
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,640
a software platform for it called the

1283
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,960
rubber nugget

1284
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,800
but basically just as i had started to

1285
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,359
double down on the nugget invader um and

1286
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,560
when we thought we were going to start

1287
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,240
selling these products through the hack

1288
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,480
five store um after like a month of

1289
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,920
intensive development we decided to

1290
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,839
switch over to this product since it had

1291
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,640
a

1292
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,319
much clearer purpose and since it was

1293
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,760
more in line with the audience that we

1294
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,720
were trying to sell to

1295
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,160
so this is where things also became um

1296
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,520
super confusing it's a little bit hard

1297
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,960
to explain but

1298
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,880
as all this stuff was going on um we

1299
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,800
also decided to make a slimmer like

1300
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,240
smaller version of the nugget and we

1301
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,079
were left in this absolute hell where we

1302
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,839
had three different products two of

1303
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,319
which were beginner kits we had like a

1304
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,000
small version and then all this crazy

1305
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,599
software that was floating out there

1306
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,319
we eventually did a soft launch on the

1307
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,079
hack five store of

1308
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,240
300 of these devices running this new

1309
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,079
usb attack software that we came up with

1310
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,520
called the rubber nugget which i'll show

1311
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,240
you a little bit in a second here

1312
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,760
but it was all very last minute at this

1313
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,440
point we had just decided what we wanted

1314
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,359
our product to do and this was focused

1315
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,839
just around the s2 platform but we

1316
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,680
decided that we wanted our tool to be a

1317
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,240
usb attack platform that could run

1318
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,319
beginner usb attacks and also be used to

1319
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,960
guide user and can also be used to guide

1320
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,800
users

1321
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,640
through the basics of running usb hacks

1322
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,480
so this was one of the graphics that we

1323
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,720
created for the initial launch um

1324
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,040
but the way we pitched this was that the

1325
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,119
um usb nugget confusingly enough we

1326
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,640
branded it as the software name the

1327
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,680
rubber

1328
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,400
is a beginner tool for learning how to

1329
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,119
run usb attacks and that's really what

1330
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,560
we were focusing on

1331
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,720
but we never really solved our issue of

1332
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,000
all the other hardware platforms and

1333
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,839
software that was floating out there so

1334
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,920
this was all kind of ambiguous and up in

1335
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,040
the air and there was still a lot of

1336
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
brand confusion for us in product

1337
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,200
confusion

1338
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,839
so what did we learn from this whole

1339
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,160
crisis um

1340
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,920
we're still sort of coming down from

1341
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,839
this initial launch and working on

1342
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,640
sorting out our branding

1343
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,240
so we still have

1344
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,520
three products that are floating out

1345
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,960
there we still have

1346
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,880
different softwares that we're

1347
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,800
trying to differentiate between

1348
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,400
but what we learned ultimately was that

1349
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
you can't make a product that appeals to

1350
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,520
everyone

1351
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,839
um that was our biggest screw-up

1352
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,680
everything from the hardware level down

1353
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,960
to the software that we were creating

1354
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,000
you can't really create like an

1355
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,880
all-in-one platform

1356
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,359
um and that you really need to figure

1357
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,200
out the niche that you're trying to

1358
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,040
appeal to in our case we worked a little

1359
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,480
bit backwards where at first we just

1360
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,240
created this random hardware platform

1361
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,760
and we didn't really focus on who we

1362
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,520
were trying to sell to but what we

1363
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,319
eventually came around to um was

1364
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,319
figuring out that we cornered a

1365
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,400
particular part of the cyber security

1366
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,160
market through hack five and we

1367
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,079
eventually figured out that um

1368
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,400
the best thing to do was to focus on the

1369
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,079
beginners in that community since we had

1370
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,839
a really friendly tool and to try to

1371
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,000
sell um

1372
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,440
our product um

1373
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,720
sort of in that late

1374
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,640
so what i also learned from this is

1375
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,520
the best way to sort of engender or

1376
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,880
rep the product that you're trying to

1377
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,920
create

1378
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,040
is if you want to create something

1379
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,160
successful

1380
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,000
you should take inspiration from others

1381
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,359
who are

1382
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,680
sort of in your space um but don't

1383
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,000
exactly copy from them so sort of my

1384
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,800
process for this is after identifying

1385
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,319
the niche that you're trying to appeal

1386
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,480
to figure out who's your direct

1387
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,920
competition

1388
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,440
figure out ways that you can achieve

1389
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,359
parity to the

1390
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,760
products that are on your level

1391
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,240
eventually overcome that and then move

1392
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,839
up from there and target um

1393
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,720
target other companies or brands or

1394
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,079
things like that that you feel like are

1395
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,520
a little bit above you but you

1396
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,960
eventually want to achieve

1397
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,240
like their status

1398
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,119
if you're trying to sell a product to

1399
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,559
somebody what you really need to do with

1400
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,800
their product is be able to tell a story

1401
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,559
with it

1402
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,280
in our case this was focusing on the cat

1403
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,800
themed and cat shaped aspect of it and

1404
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,720
making it a gamified interface that was

1405
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,200
easy for beginners to understand

1406
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,559
um this is still something that we're

1407
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,480
working on developing

1408
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,559
but cohesive branding is also a very

1409
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,800
important thing i feel like we had a lot

1410
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,400
of trouble branding this product but

1411
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,960
once we eventually focused on um the

1412
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,640
areas that we got right like for example

1413
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,440
the

1414
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,040
um beginner-friendly interface and that

1415
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,119
kind of thing that's once that's when it

1416
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,040
all started to make sense and people

1417
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,119
started to understand our product

1418
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,319
and also the last thing is understanding

1419
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,880
a business model

1420
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,640
that works for you in our case pairing

1421
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,040
content with the hardware that we

1422
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,599
were selling um ended up working out for

1423
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,760
us

1424
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,599
um this would probably look different

1425
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,359
depending on what you're trying to do

1426
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,720
but yeah

1427
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,240
and also that you can't really um

1428
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,558
have an all-in-one multi-tool platform

1429
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,200
and then just some other mistakes that

1430
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,520
we made

1431
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,280
at some point or another we ended up

1432
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,160
getting

1433
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,319
too cocky along the development process

1434
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,760
and there were points where we wouldn't

1435
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,839
um test out our products like recently

1436
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,800
we ordered 500 assembled modules

1437
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,960
um of these boards from china now that

1438
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,319
we're trying to outsource our um

1439
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,280
assembly process

1440
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,200
and we basically swapped out one of our

1441
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,040
components for a slightly cheaper

1442
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,640
version that we never tested out but it

1443
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,960
turns out the supplier

1444
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,319
completely screwed up the design

1445
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,640
so now we have 500 broken boards on hand

1446
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,720
that we'll have to manually fix

1447
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,160
but the lesson that we learned from that

1448
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,839
is that everything should be extensively

1449
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,319
tested

1450
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,359
cool does anybody have any questions

1451
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,359
about anything also thank you guys for

1452
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,640
coming

1453
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,799
yeah

1454
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,280
thank you alex for the talk i think we

1455
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,200
can do one question

1456
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,319
cool anyone have one question

1457
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,839
yes

1458
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,160
initially we started selling these um

1459
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,400
just through our store personally um

1460
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,240
sort of as like an experiment before we

1461
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,079
were going to launch through the hack

1462
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,359
five store

1463
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,960
so we sort of used that as like a

1464
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,480
testing grounds to see like what people

1465
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,839
thought of the platform we also were

1466
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,839
running smaller batches there

1467
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,440
um so that way we weren't like fully

1468
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,200
committed to like doing a full

1469
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,640
production run with like a product that

1470
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,720
we were like unsure of so first we were

1471
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,079
selling on our store which is

1472
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,079
hatcat.comcat.com

1473
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,160
um

1474
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,680
we did a soft launch through the hack

1475
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,520
five store at hack5.org and we're hoping

1476
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,880
to sell more of these in the future

1477
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,800
excellent all right well thank you so

1478
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,119
much for the talk it was fascinating

1479
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,480
thank you audience for attending the

1480
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,280
talk

1481
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,520
uh if you have if you want to post any

1482
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,359
content if you post in the matrix chat

1483
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,359
everyone in the audience can go access

1484
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,960
the matrix chat and see anything you

1485
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
have if you have any other questions for

1486
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,559
for alex go ahead and reach out to him

1487
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,280
through the matrix chat

1488
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,880
and our next talk tonight is going to be

1489
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,480
don't get tangled up in your cape hero

1490
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,240
culture is a negative force in cyber

1491
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,319
security that will start in about eight

1492
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,079
minutes so come back if you can

1493
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,839
you
