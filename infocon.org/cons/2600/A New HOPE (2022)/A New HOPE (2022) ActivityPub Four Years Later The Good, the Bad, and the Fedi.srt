00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
foreign

2
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,160
hi welcome everyone

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,960
for our one o'clock session on activity

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
pub just a couple of reminders put your

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,360
phones on vibrate stun whatever you want

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,280
to call it

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,440
make sure you stay hydrated

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
just so you know there's fire exits if

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,199
in the case of an emergency please exit

10
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,480
calmly

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
if you have any questions or comments uh

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
you'll see people with the radios

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,440
walking around also folks in

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
blue shirts blue volunteer shirts feel

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,680
free to ask them any questions uh right

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
now again i'd like to introduce roll

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
time who's going to give a synopsis of

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,400
activity pub four years later welcome

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,159
hi everyone that uh that second coffee

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,200
was a mistake um

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
all right so first of all hello everyone

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,439
my name is roll time i want to thank you

23
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
all so much for being here uh and i want

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
to say thank you to the organizers of

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,600
the 2600 conference for allowing me to

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
be here also for sorting the talks

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
alphabetically because this one is right

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
at the top it's great um

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,439
yeah this is activity pub four years

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,000
later the good the bad and the fetty

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,040
verse

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
uh let's get right into it

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
first of all i want to introduce myself

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,720
uh i am not an expert i am not an author

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,360
of the activity pub spec i am just a

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,600
user of activity pub i've been on

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,159
activity pub and mastodon for a couple

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,479
years now i'm here to proselytize i'm

39
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,079
here to tell you about what activity pub

40
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,799
is like and about how you can help by

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,799
joining us and help by you know working

42
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,239
on improving the spec it's still

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
evolving there's still an opportunity

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
for innovation here so

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,239
i hope you come away from this talk with

46
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,680
a greater understanding of what activity

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
pub is the ways that you can use it and

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,599
you know

49
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,200
i hope you come away enthusiastic about

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,160
this protocol and in the future

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
the first question that's really

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
important to the activity pub question

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
is what is federation the best way to

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,959
answer that question is by saying

55
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,440
federation is a network protocol

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,720
okay

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
the first network protocol that you may

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
be aware of or familiar with is the

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
client to server model this is what we

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
see on social media servers today

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
wherein all six of our clients are

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
speaking to this server if a client

63
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,800
wants to post anything or receive any

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
data they talk to the server

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
the server will then fetch data from

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,160
other clients as appropriate again this

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,480
is the model used by facebook instagram

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,519
google plus no wait uh facebook

69
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,239
facebook instagram all the mainstream

70
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,840
social networks today and it has some

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,599
vulnerabilities it has some problems we

72
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,280
see vulnerability to corporate

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,239
censorship we see the vulnerability to

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,239
to downtime when people misconfigure

75
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
their dns stuff we see vulnerability to

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,879
if the uh

77
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,400
if the single server is down everybody

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,159
is down the single server has control of

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
everything so it's safe to say this is

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,200
not a desirable protocol or architecture

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
for social media networking

82
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,879
another one you might be familiar with

83
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,040
is a peer-to-peer model we dispense with

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
our centralized server entirely and we

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
see all six of our clients simply

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,040
exchange messages amongst one another in

87
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
an open space with no control this isn't

88
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,360
vulnerable to censorship no one can

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,799
control which clients are connected and

90
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,920
what they say

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,080
but it's also inefficient because every

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,840
client has to send a message to every

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,920
other client if clients aren't online at

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
the time a message is sent then they

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
can't receive any data

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
i'm still wearing a mask

97
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
and they can't receive any data

98
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
and this is a big problem

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,560
you know

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
it's not really viable to have your

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,519
phone or your laptop on all the time

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,760
connected to stuff all the time

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
so while this would be sort of an

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
idealized great way to implement social

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,319
media that's vulnerable that's uh

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
resistant to censorship it's again it's

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,319
inviable for an actual network

108
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,798
architecture the solution or the

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,040
compromise is federation we call it

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
client to server to server to client

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
networking what we see is that our three

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
clients here are talking to server a

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,520
server a then talks to server b which

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,759
then talks to its respective clients

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,360
what this gives us is a best-case

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
scenario between centralized networking

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,360
and decentralized networking it's

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,840
semi-centralized server a can implement

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
its own rules its own guidelines and

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,479
have its own downtime meanwhile server b

121
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,160
can fetch data from server a whenever it

122
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
needs to with its own set of rules and

123
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
guidelines if server a is down server b

124
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
will still be accessible you can tell

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
because it's still on the screen there

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,800
i want to go back to this architecture

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
and i want to give everything some

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
labels just so it's clearer i'm going to

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
walk you through how a federated network

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
social network might actually function

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
so we have on free radical.zone tech

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
pepin and dade i heard some class for

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
free radical.zone

134
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
thank you uh and on post.lurk.org we

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
have kate pixel and henry who is

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
slightly behind the times let's say dade

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
wants to post a message and then all of

138
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
his followers will get it so if dade

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,759
wants to post something on his status he

140
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,280
notifies his home server free

141
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
radical.zone

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
and so then everyone on his home server

143
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,720
as in a centralized network can simply

144
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,759
fetch his message but

145
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,199
freeradical.zone will then post his

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,520
update to

147
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,039
post.work.org where anyone following

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
dade on post.org can also get a copy of

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
this message and read it for themselves

150
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
even if free radical is down so dade

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
says to free radical.zone i want to send

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
a message free radical says great it's

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
now in the database and for radical

154
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
knows

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,080
that somebody on post.look.org let's say

156
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,479
kate is following dade that message gets

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,039
pushed to post.org and then anybody on

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
that server can read that message

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
that's the essence of federation that's

160
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,840
how you build a censorship resistant

161
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,199
open democratized social network

162
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,720
i think at this point i'm a little ahead

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
in time anybody have any questions at

164
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,360
this point it's pretty important to the

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
rest of the talk so if anything isn't

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,318
clear anything i'm missing

167
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,080
great question um not at this time uh

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,880
that's

169
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
unfortunately something we don't have

170
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
implemented but if your server is down

171
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,199
other users on different servers can

172
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,280
still access copies of your data that

173
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
their server may have

174
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,479
but

175
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,800
your server is your server

176
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
yes

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
sorry i cut off the bottom of the g but

178
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
that is a g um that's a great question

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,599
thank you for asking it standardization

180
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,960
um so what we have is called the fitty

181
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
verse um this talk does have emojis in

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
it we have it's called the fetiverse

183
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,919
it's this wider network of standardized

184
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,960
ideally

185
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
ideally standardized servers and clients

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,720
that all know how to talk to each other

187
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
using this one single language but we

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,199
didn't always have a single language in

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,280
2008 we saw the first kind of federated

190
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,319
system come out it was called identica

191
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,080
identity.ca and it ran gnu social

192
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,479
which implemented the o status protocol

193
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,080
but not everyone was using the o status

194
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
protocol o status uh wasn't a new

195
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,840
project gnu social was about as

196
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,080
featureful and useful as gnu heard right

197
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
so um diaspora was a competing protocol

198
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,960
if you were on o status you couldn't

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
talk to somebody who was on diaspora it

200
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
was this messy situation of competing

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,520
standards and people not being able to

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
have a cohesive experience

203
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,080
so out of this comes the w3c social

204
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
working group headed up by christine

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
lemmer weber who's the primary author of

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,280
activity pub she'll come up a little bit

207
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,080
later

208
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,000
uh the mission of which was to create a

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
single standard which would unify

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,599
everyone's experiences and be the be all

211
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,360
and end all for a federated social

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
networking experience and i know what

213
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
you're thinking you've seen this xkcd

214
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,080
about standards

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,319
and you're thinking surely this couldn't

216
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,479
have worked um unfortunately i have bad

217
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
news for you it did

218
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,800
activity pub was born in 2018 as this

219
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,599
unified standard which created a way for

220
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,199
anybody to talk to anybody else using

221
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,879
federated networking it was beautiful it

222
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,960
was open it was accessible and it was a

223
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,360
w3c standard so now what you see is

224
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,199
everybody doing federated networking

225
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,360
these days is using activity pub

226
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
i want to give a brief technical rundown

227
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
of activity pub

228
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,640
in about three words json over email

229
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
in more detail i'll tell you that

230
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
activity pub uses email like addressing

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,599
you can send messages to address at

232
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,040
instance

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,959
and you send json posts so that'll be

234
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,560
something like a post you'll have the

235
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
author the content the date things like

236
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
that it's essentially a spec for pushing

237
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
data using email like addressing to

238
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
various servers uh a moment for some

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,320
technical uh terminology i want to say

240
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,519
an instance

241
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
is a specific server which hosts a

242
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,600
protocol a specific server which hosts a

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
platform a platform being activity pub

244
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,680
enabled software so if you are on an

245
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
instance you're hosting some kind of

246
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
software that might be like mastodon or

247
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,519
something like that that's instant

248
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
specific server platform is software and

249
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,640
of course the protocol is activity pub

250
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
again the technical rundown i'm not

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,839
going to go into too much detail on that

252
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
because this is not the first talk at

253
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,640
activity

254
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,959
first activity pub talk i hope uh

255
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
certainly not the best normal would be

256
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
the last i encourage you to go and do

257
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,839
your own research and look into this

258
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,120
more

259
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
um but what this led to was a case of

260
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
what i call activity of evangelism

261
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
suddenly in 2018 we had this gigantic

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
open standard everybody could use it and

263
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
everybody would be right now that

264
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
anybody could host their own social

265
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
media server what was stopping anybody

266
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,519
from doing that surely this will be the

267
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
end of facebook this will be the end of

268
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
twitter this will be the end of google

269
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
now this will be the end of facebook

270
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,399
twitter instagram

271
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,440
right

272
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
and so we saw at hope 2020 these

273
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,200
wonderful five people one of whom is in

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
the audience can i get a quick round of

275
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
applause for tech the admin of my home

276
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,720
server who pays money to host

277
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,160
yeah

278
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
he pays money to host the things that i

279
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
say which is crazy to me um

280
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
anyway these five people uh hopefully

281
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
some of them are watching one of whom is

282
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
here

283
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
came out at hope 2020 and said this is

284
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
your moment start your own activity pub

285
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,399
server take your data back take your

286
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,200
experience back

287
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
it didn't work right four years later

288
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
the activity pub spec has received zero

289
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,800
updates since its release one of the

290
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
links on the activity pub homepage now

291
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
502s

292
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,320
that's on the w3c website

293
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
there are about six to seven million

294
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
users throughout the total fetiverse

295
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,560
some of whom are active which is a large

296
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,800
number and an absolute sense but it's

297
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,519
safe to say activity pub has not taken

298
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
down social media giants we have failed

299
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,240
in our goal of bringing a constructive

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
social media experience to everybody we

301
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
have however brought a constructive

302
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,640
social media experience to people who

303
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
are using the fetiverse right now

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
so we're going to address four topics

305
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
today we're going to address

306
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
architectural benefits of activity pub

307
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
the ways in which activity pub is really

308
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
good we're going to address

309
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
architectural limitations problems with

310
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,519
the spec that have prevented it from

311
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,680
proliferating and becoming really useful

312
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,760
we're going to address instance benefits

313
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
what's it like to actually use the

314
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,040
fetiverse today and we're going to

315
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
address instance limitations so the

316
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
benefits limitations and problems with

317
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
both the standard and the way that we're

318
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
using it

319
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,040
first of all architectural benefits

320
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,200
the big thing about a standard is it's a

321
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
standard we have cross-platform

322
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
federation anybody who speaks the

323
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,880
activity pub language can talk to

324
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
anybody else who speaks the activity pub

325
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
language here i am on uh frendica

326
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,320
specifically venera.social frenica is a

327
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,600
facebook-like platform

328
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,040
and i'm actually looking at my own

329
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
profile on mastodon which is uh

330
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,240
twitteresque

331
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,160
so you can see this is space filling

332
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
curvy that's my username i can see my

333
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
profile i can see mastodon ap means i'm

334
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
following myself via activity pub we can

335
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
see some of my own posts on here i don't

336
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,519
know if you can read those unfortunately

337
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,200
i don't think activity pub made me any

338
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,920
funnier but uh but i can in fact see the

339
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
things that i've posted even if they're

340
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
not that good

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
there is a problem here and that this is

342
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,040
not actually the four most recent post

343
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,320
on my profile

344
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,880
uh there are discrepancies here between

345
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
the mastodon version of my feed and the

346
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,399
friendica version of my feed which

347
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,600
shouldn't be there

348
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,959
we're gonna talk about problems in a

349
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,639
moment

350
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,920
the really other great thing about

351
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
democratized social media this isn't

352
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,880
specific to activity pub but the

353
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
fetiverse as a whole is we can have

354
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,760
instance specific rules and guidelines

355
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,680
right so free radical.zone my home

356
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,240
server has focuses on leftward politics

357
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,040
infosec cat pictures generally

358
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,720
interesting people doing interesting

359
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,959
things and what i see in my home

360
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,000
timeline

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
post on my instance is people who have

362
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
done cool projects or found cool things

363
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
it's it's very in-depth technical

364
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
discussion and that's what i like to see

365
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,519
i don't like to see as much of those

366
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
kind of slice of life hey i went to the

367
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,720
bank today posts that i might see on

368
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
other instances but i can still follow

369
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
people on other instances and i can get

370
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,880
information from them on other instances

371
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,639
i just get to choose where from and the

372
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,480
central focus of my experience revolves

373
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
around my instance and its guidelines

374
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
free radical.zone also has some rules uh

375
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,040
has for instance some very strict rules

376
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,560
against hate speech and misinformation

377
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
um one of the great things about

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
activity pub we get freedom of speech

379
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
freedom of filter right if you're on

380
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
twitter twitter gets to decide what is

381
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,360
okay for anybody to say which you may

382
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,199
agree with or not but take it or leave

383
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,320
it right if you're on twitter you're on

384
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
twitter

385
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,720
hopefully you're not um activity pub

386
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,639
lets you host your own server and do

387
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,040
your own thing up to and including the

388
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,120
actual user interface and user

389
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
experience

390
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,360
so

391
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
i'll give you an example of this there's

392
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,240
a platform you may be aware of called

393
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,040
gab which is a right-wing fascistic

394
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,279
social network reporting itself as a

395
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,360
free speech zone whatever the hell that

396
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
means

397
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,040
and they are running on activity pub

398
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
they have an activity pub network and

399
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,199
various servers within the the gab

400
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
verse thing but i've never heard from

401
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,199
anyone on gab and i certainly don't

402
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,600
intend to because my server and all the

403
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
servers that my server talks to have

404
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
de-federated from gab we've strictly

405
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
blocked communications from them they

406
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
have a space to say whatever they want

407
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,480
they have their freedom of speech we're

408
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,680
going to filter them out we're not going

409
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,279
to listen

410
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
but again nobody gets to decide what's

411
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,560
okay to say you just get decide what you

412
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
want to hear

413
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
there are some architectural issues with

414
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
activity pub when it was released it

415
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
came without any kind of authentication

416
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,480
or consent spec what that means is that

417
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,120
in an ideal fetiverse we'd see a user's

418
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,600
identity as wholly separate from their

419
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,160
instance right i shouldn't be beholden

420
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,079
to the admin of free radical even though

421
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,480
i i trust you um i shouldn't be beholden

422
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,399
to the admin of free radical to define

423
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,920
what i'm saying

424
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
i should be cryptographically guaranteed

425
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,040
to be myself and if i don't like the

426
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,199
terms that periodical is providing me i

427
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,279
can pack up my stuff and leave and go to

428
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,519
another instance or start my own but

429
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
activity pub didn't release with any

430
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
kind of consent mechanism meaning that

431
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,839
if an admin wants to

432
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,839
they can simply say that their one of

433
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
their users said something and there's

434
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
no way for anybody to verify that

435
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,639
outside of a manual pgp key

436
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,160
going back to christine lumber-webber

437
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,920
she's aware of this issue it's mentioned

438
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,839
in the activity of pub spec hey we know

439
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,360
this is a problem we're we're working on

440
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
it we'll get back to you it's been four

441
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,279
years um but christine lumber weber

442
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,600
founded the sprightly institute

443
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,279
and they've been working on some really

444
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,320
cool stuff including ocap status

445
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,360
i think that's what it's called ocap

446
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,720
status and that lets you define a wholly

447
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
cryptographically guaranteed identity

448
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,079
independent of anything that's hosting

449
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,800
you and so if we see that reach maturity

450
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
and integration into one later version

451
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
of activity pub or a later open protocol

452
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
we'll see this problem solved

453
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
the other problem that activity pub has

454
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,000
and that federated networks have in

455
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,720
general is instant tribalism which is to

456
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,639
say that communities don't live at the

457
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
instance level communities live at the

458
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
level of tags at the level of topics at

459
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,959
the level of common interests and it's

460
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,720
really impossible for an instance to

461
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,800
address that with granularity instances

462
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
can be groups of people with a lot of

463
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
interest in common but you can still see

464
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,959
things you don't want to

465
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
and so

466
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,399
we have to find the balance between

467
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
granularity accessibility and creating

468
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,040
communities around what we want them to

469
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,680
be

470
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,279
uh created around so that is an

471
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,639
architectural issue

472
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
implementation benefits i'm going to

473
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
stop right here and say if you are not

474
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,839
on activity pub which basically means if

475
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,199
you're not on mastodon it's like the

476
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,560
biggest platform we'll talk about that

477
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
if you're not activity pub join please

478
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,399
dear god join it is so much better than

479
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,360
twitter

480
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,160
um

481
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480
i know that's not a low bar uh or that

482
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
is a low bar rather but activity pub

483
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
mastodon is incredible it's full of

484
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,759
great people and you should join and i

485
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,880
want to make that clear even though

486
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,839
we're going to talk about some of the

487
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,920
problems there is nothing better for you

488
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
to do than joining and helping us fix

489
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,600
those problems

490
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
so our case study is mastodon as i've

491
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
said it's far and away the largest fatty

492
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
virus platform to the degree that if you

493
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,480
visit the website fetty.guide you'll see

494
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,559
a page called what is mastodon even

495
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,400
though fetiverse guide is an accessible

496
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,919
guide to federated decentralized

497
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,480
services mastodon is the fetiverse

498
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,520
experience

499
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,640
and so when we're talking about the

500
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,480
day-to-day experience we need to be

501
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,520
talking about mastodon

502
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
here's the user interface master as i

503
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,640
said is is twitter-like so we have a

504
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
home timeline and this is what i'd see

505
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,760
similar to a twitter timeline it's posts

506
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
from people that i follow and posts that

507
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
they have boosted or retweeted as you

508
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,600
may be familiar with um i've got

509
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
somebody in here who's posting about

510
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,360
seals and the word boo

511
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,960
um

512
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
this is only people i've post followed

513
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
it's not algorithmic it's entirely based

514
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,799
on the order in which things are posted

515
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,480
so mastodon doesn't attempt to hijack

516
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,799
your attention or radicalize you in

517
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,919
various ways mastodon is just trying to

518
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,600
bring you the posts from the people

519
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
you've agreed to see

520
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
there are two other timelines and this

521
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
is what really separates mastodon

522
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
experientially from twitter the local

523
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
and the federated timeline and they're

524
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
both really interesting the local

525
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
timeline is posts from people on your

526
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,679
instance that is free radical.zone

527
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,200
in my case or whatever instance you may

528
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
be following and if you've picked the

529
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
right instance that has a guidelines and

530
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,039
rules specific to you you'll probably

531
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,799
see posts from people you find

532
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,320
interesting and on topics you find

533
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,919
interesting that can give you an idea of

534
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,520
who you want to follow or teach you

535
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,559
about something new you might want to

536
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,640
engage in so a local timeline is like a

537
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
little community it's who's close to you

538
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,840
and it's people you may want to reach

539
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,280
out to it's a great way of discovering

540
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
things that doesn't rely on an algorithm

541
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,640
like you'd see on other services

542
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
our third option here is the federated

543
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,039
timeline this is every post

544
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,280
from every server that someone on your

545
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,559
server follows

546
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
uh it is a lot um and it's basically all

547
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
the data that your instance is getting

548
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
and it's

549
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
again it scrolls by quickly i don't know

550
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,120
why someone wanted to follow arch linux

551
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
arch linux package updates but somebody

552
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,760
did

553
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
and now they can see everything

554
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,559
happening with the one true operating

555
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,880
system um in any case that's not

556
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,840
something i want to see but the

557
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,679
fetiverse or the federated timeline is a

558
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,280
useful kind of way of graphing what

559
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,720
people on your instance are interested

560
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,799
in and what's the zeitgeist of the

561
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,840
entire

562
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
network at that time your corner of the

563
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,679
verse so it's useful i wouldn't browse

564
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,320
it all the time

565
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,919
uh mastodon has some really interesting

566
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,320
cultural mores that make it really good

567
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,039
to use for anybody and let's talk about

568
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,480
it

569
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,840
content warnings

570
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,520
are a big thing on mastodon so you'll

571
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,320
see a user here demi mom elect.xyz your

572
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
name is june posted something with this

573
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,760
content warning physical health ph minus

574
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
this is a negative statement about a

575
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
user's physical health and she's using

576
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,559
this shorthand

577
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
which is kind of common on macedon so

578
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,360
that people are clear on what she's

579
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,799
talking about

580
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,240
i want to see this post i click show

581
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
more here it is it's her talking about

582
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,159
how she woke up felt worse today and

583
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,240
went to the doctor but if i didn't want

584
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,679
to see a post that was negative about

585
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
physical health i wasn't interested i

586
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
could simply scroll right past that it

587
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
wouldn't have bothered me right so

588
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
mastodon lets you kind of define your

589
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
experience

590
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,840
and decide what you want to see

591
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
at any given moment you see content

592
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,080
warnings uh for gore for different types

593
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,360
of nsfw posts porn uh you see stuff for

594
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,679
physical health mental health

595
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,760
politics so if you're not feeling

596
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
something if you have triggers related

597
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,640
to something you don't have to look at

598
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,080
anything you don't want to and there's a

599
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
really strong culture of making sure

600
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
that we are filtering and creating a

601
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,120
positive wholesome experience here

602
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,039
one of the ways you'll see these content

603
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,640
warnings used is with

604
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
one of the ways you'll see these used is

605
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,799
with jokes we have this person what do

606
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,600
you get if you insult a bowman

607
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,480
i didn't post this it's a crossbowman um

608
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,919
anyway i i

609
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,840
but so you've used it as a joke set up

610
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,720
here right so what do you get if you

611
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
insult to bowman you click show more

612
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,240
there's a little bit of a setup payoff

613
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,559
by the way i did ask both of these users

614
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,280
if i could like post their content

615
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,360
and one of them said yes but i hope to

616
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
see 52 100 follower increase after that

617
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,000
talk

618
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that's their username you all know what

619
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
to do

620
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,960
so they should be the second person you

621
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
follow after you join mastodon after of

622
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
course me

623
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,559
the other thing we see a lot of is alt

624
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
text and this is great let's say i found

625
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,159
this wonderful comic from saturday

626
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,840
morning breakfast cereal it's my daily

627
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,760
dose of existential crisis

628
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,159
uh talking about how these people

629
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,280
uh are not even dead but never existed i

630
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
hope you're all having a great day um

631
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,840
we see this comic here i decided this is

632
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,799
great i have to share this with my

633
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,799
followers they have to see it

634
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,039
so i put it in my compose box and

635
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,720
mastodon and i'll actually get a warning

636
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
that says no description added

637
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
mastodon is giving me a warning that

638
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
this content might not be accessible so

639
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,159
if i go ahead and click on no

640
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,559
description added i can actually see on

641
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,159
the left described for the visually

642
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,120
impaired

643
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,039
and it gives me 1500 characters to

644
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,880
transcribe the text in this image so

645
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
that anybody who can't see images

646
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
whether that's because they have

647
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,159
vision impairment or they're using a

648
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,480
text only browser or they don't have a

649
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,919
fast data connection anybody who can't

650
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
see images for any reason can still get

651
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,840
the alt text and can still see what this

652
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
image says

653
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
i can also define by moving that circle

654
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,400
around i can also define

655
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
where this preview will be in our 16x9

656
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,919
preview before someone actually opens

657
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,760
the image so mastodon has a really

658
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,480
robust toolkit to allow me to edit

659
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,440
markup and apply alt text to images so

660
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,960
that again they're more accessible and

661
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,840
useful for people actually browsing this

662
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,360
experience all of this comes together to

663
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,039
say that mastodon is probably the best

664
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,440
place to be for any given person who

665
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,039
wants to customize their social media

666
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,880
experience who doesn't like interacting

667
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
with twitter for some reason who may

668
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
have triggers they don't want to see

669
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
mastodon gives you tools and people use

670
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,159
those tools importantly we have a

671
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,919
culture of using those tools

672
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,120
to create a better social media

673
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
experience for everyone mastodon is also

674
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,559
um

675
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,480
the most probably the friendliest place

676
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
on the internet when it comes to queer

677
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,360
people

678
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,159
i do want to say that it leans left and

679
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,080
tech heavy and so is friendly to white

680
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
queer people there are still issues with

681
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,039
integration of people of color and favor

682
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,039
struggles with that we're working on it

683
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,640
again the best way to fix it is people

684
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
to join

685
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
there are implementation issues and the

686
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
big one i'm going to talk about is

687
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
platform feature diversity

688
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,120
so when i followed myself from frendica

689
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,799
like half an hour ago when i followed

690
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,720
myself from frendica i sent a follow

691
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,880
request and frank informed me i'm now

692
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,159
following roll time at radical.zone what

693
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,760
theoretical.zone told me was that i had

694
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,279
a follow request from frendica frendica

695
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,279
doesn't get updates from mastodon on

696
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,480
whether the follow request was

697
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,720
successful that's a feature diversity

698
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,919
issue

699
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,159
because these platforms don't have the

700
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,559
same implementation for follow requests

701
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,480
and they can't talk to each other so we

702
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
have this theoretically interoperable

703
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,039
system everything built on activity pub

704
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,679
but the actual experience day to day is

705
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,679
that it's really hard to follow somebody

706
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,799
else and actually interact with them

707
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,039
yeah

708
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,840
yes

709
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
i don't this just doesn't work and i

710
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
don't know why not

711
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,880
and i don't know if anybody knows why

712
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,159
not and that's kind of the problem is

713
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,840
that it's really hard to standardize

714
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,720
things

715
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
another thing activity pub has support

716
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,200
for is language specification you can

717
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
say this toot is in oh we call them

718
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,640
toots i guess it's quirky um this tude

719
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,200
is in english or german or whatever like

720
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,440
dutch as it were um you have language

721
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,200
support but mastodon didn't implement

722
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,520
that until two months ago and so i was

723
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,600
seeing lots of posts in german which

724
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,720
wasn't that helpful to me instance only

725
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,520
posts are a thing on some platforms like

726
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,559
hometown which is a fork of mastodon

727
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,799
on hometown you can create a post that

728
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,799
is only shown to people on your instance

729
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,240
it won't federate

730
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,679
and that's really useful if you're

731
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,440
creating a community for your friends

732
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,919
and you want only them to be able to see

733
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,240
this thing about you right

734
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
activity pub is for creating communities

735
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,440
instances only posts are really useful

736
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,799
for that but mastodon as a whole doesn't

737
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,840
have it so there are various platforms

738
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,360
all of which have thought oh it'd be

739
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,679
cool to have this because this isn't an

740
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,120
activity pub or we want to do it

741
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,799
slightly differently

742
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,840
but it doesn't work there's no

743
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,520
interoperability there when these

744
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,480
platforms diverge

745
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
okay the big thing the big the big

746
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
recommendation at the end of this talk

747
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
starts with a question

748
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
why is social media

749
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
and we know why facebook we know why

750
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,720
instagram we know why twitter the answer

751
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
is money

752
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,240
the answer to why is facebook is to sell

753
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,799
you things to harvest your data

754
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,600
and to manipulate you with abusive

755
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
algorithms

756
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
why is activity pub

757
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,799
is the answer to why is activity pub

758
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,600
just to take users away from facebook is

759
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
the answer to why is mastodon to make a

760
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
twitter clone that just doesn't show you

761
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,360
ads or have an algorithm

762
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
right now that's what the fetiverse is

763
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,840
an alternative at best to social media

764
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,600
platforms and an alternative that your

765
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
friends aren't on so why would you be on

766
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
it

767
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,320
but activity pub can be a lot more

768
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
i'm going to scroll through the

769
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,840
instances uh some various instances some

770
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,520
various user interfaces for some

771
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
platforms i want you to take a look and

772
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,200
see if there's something you see in all

773
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,279
of these uh a kind of common factor

774
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,559
right

775
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,480
here's mastodon again with our three uh

776
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,000
our r3 home

777
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,760
local federated

778
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
here's lemmy lemmy's kind of a reddit

779
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,600
style clone

780
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,200
here's pixelfed pixelfed is like

781
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
instagram

782
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,039
friendica again let's go through it

783
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,279
right mastodon

784
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,720
lemmy

785
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,159
pixelfed

786
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,440
frendica

787
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,279
what's the common uniting factor here

788
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,039
what's the thing that all of these

789
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
supposedly disparate unique interesting

790
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,790
platforms have in common

791
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,000
[Laughter]

792
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,600
as they should

793
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,880
timelines right the answer is timelines

794
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,600
why are timelines a timeline is a is a

795
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
corporate thing right facebook shows you

796
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,960
a timeline because they have an

797
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,720
algorithm that is supposed to pick for

798
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
you what they think you'll find

799
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
interesting twitter wants to show you

800
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,360
ads in your timeline and they want to

801
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
show you things you'll find interesting

802
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,080
interspersed with things you won't so

803
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
they can skinners box you into staying

804
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,679
on their platform for six hours a day no

805
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,360
one should be on social media for six

806
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,279
hours a day and i know that cause i'm on

807
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,720
social media for more than six hours a

808
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,840
day

809
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
timelines are not an interaction

810
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,279
mechanism they're a consumption

811
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
mechanism they're designed to lull you

812
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,279
into this endless doom scroll and i

813
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,200
think we can all relate to how unhappy

814
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,120
that makes us

815
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,840
timelines suck

816
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,320
here's mastodon they have it on their

817
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,440
homepage joinmastodon.com.org

818
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
john mastodon

819
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,039
this says i want i want you to know be

820
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,080
careful they're very they're very

821
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,679
careful about their language here

822
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,840
your feed is chronological ad-free and

823
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
non-algorithmic you decide who you want

824
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,720
to see you can only follow people

825
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
you can't follow content

826
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,399
so corey doctorow who is at this

827
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,919
conference and i think he was inspired

828
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,320
by me um recently made a blog post about

829
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
this um he talked about the title of it

830
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,159
and if i'm gonna link it you'll see it

831
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,559
in a second the title of it is uh

832
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,559
so you've unfollowed me we're good and

833
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,919
it's talking about how he has issues

834
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,919
with people who message him saying corey

835
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
i love your blog posts or i love your

836
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,360
long-range twitter threads but i hate

837
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,200
these pictures of your dog i hate these

838
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
are the things you're posting why are we

839
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,799
following people

840
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,320
a timeline only works if you have an

841
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,159
algorithm designed to pick the most

842
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,399
interesting posts from the crud of the

843
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,240
internet right a timeline

844
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
is made by an algorithm which dredges

845
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
all this and then will sieve it for you

846
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,880
the mastodon timeline is frankly pretty

847
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,200
boring and it's because you can't decide

848
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,559
what you want to see

849
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
you can only decide in aggregate who you

850
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,720
want to hear from

851
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,799
power to the user

852
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,159
that's the theme of this talk that's

853
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,039
what we're going to talk about and i'm

854
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,320
actually going to change it i don't want

855
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,159
it to be power to the user power to the

856
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,399
participant when i want someone to log

857
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,840
on when i want to log into a social

858
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
media site my goal should not be to sit

859
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,840
there and scroll and hear from people it

860
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
should be to participate

861
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
i want to go and see what my friends and

862
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,120
the people whose opinions i respect are

863
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
saying about this and then i want to

864
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,039
contribute to the conversation i want to

865
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,720
be able to collate topics bring them

866
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,120
together curate an experience that i can

867
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
then modify and send out to other people

868
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,880
that's the power of social networking

869
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,720
that's the power of the internet that's

870
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,640
what we're not doing

871
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,240
i should be able to browse a topic a

872
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,640
really robust topic like a hashtag and

873
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,720
then say okay people are also looking at

874
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,600
this thing there's a lot of

875
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,880
interoperability and i can make

876
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,039
connections between these two topics

877
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,240
right i need to be able to follow the

878
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
zeitgeist

879
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,799
and i need to be able to do it in an

880
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
active sense creating the things as i'm

881
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,279
consuming them because again no one

882
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,880
should be able to do this for six hours

883
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,799
a day it should be interesting and

884
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,880
engaging and take mental effort because

885
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,720
that's what gets people to wake up and

886
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,279
stop just listening

887
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,640
whoever has ever hosted a minecraft

888
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
server

889
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,320
okay who knows a child who's hosted a

890
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,679
minecraft server

891
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,840
yeah yeah yeah right right so

892
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
you can host a microsoft you can you can

893
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
spin one up in five minutes and then you

894
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,000
can create a world a universe and your

895
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,679
friends can join and they can create a

896
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,000
world a universe you can sculpt the

897
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,440
thing that you're interacting with and

898
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
that will school and that will also

899
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,039
sculpt your future interactions in

900
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,880
minecraft

901
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,760
there's unity between what you make and

902
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,279
what you see

903
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,279
and that's the experience that we need

904
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,399
to bring

905
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,399
to social networking there's a word here

906
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,600
that maybe in your minds that i'm

907
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
creeping up on it's metaverse nobody

908
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
likes the metaverse because nobody likes

909
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,399
meta facebook they're stupid right i i

910
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,679
hope at this point we're all clear on

911
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,000
the fact that they suck um but the

912
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
metaverse already exists it's called

913
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,360
gary's mod i don't know if any of you

914
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
have ever played but the metaverse is

915
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
really what it needs to be what it isn't

916
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,679
but what it should be

917
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,039
is just an experience that you can

918
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,039
create and have other people help you

919
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,480
create it we need to take these

920
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,159
paradigms these ideas that have existed

921
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,760
in gary's mod in minecraft and

922
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,240
multi-user dungeons in online text

923
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
adventure games take these paradigms of

924
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,039
interaction and creation and bring them

925
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,399
to the social media networking

926
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,880
experience our goal should not be to

927
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,799
make a better version of twitter our

928
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,559
goal should be to create something that

929
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
makes twitter feel really really lame

930
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,200
because it is really really lame

931
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
i've hated on twitter all at this talk

932
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,159
in any case

933
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,799
that is about all that i have for you um

934
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,519
here are there are my socials on on uh

935
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,200
theoretical and then also twitter that

936
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,600
link will post you to some resources

937
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,039
thank you all very much for coming and

938
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,158
listening i really appreciate it

939
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,799
[Applause]

940
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,559
and so i assume i'm pretty short here so

941
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,918
we have some questions i hope

942
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,320
this is a professional conference

943
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,080
hi

944
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,039
um so you mentioned that you know

945
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,760
a lot of your friends might not be on

946
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,000
these social media platforms and you

947
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,360
know you've spent this talk talking

948
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,440
about how awesome some of these features

949
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,159
are and how much i want to use this um

950
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,039
what how do we get people who

951
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
aren't like as tech savvy like how do i

952
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,120
get my mom to use this you know

953
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,399
because

954
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,519
i feel like

955
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,440
with social media the more people on the

956
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
better and the more people that use

957
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,000
social medias like mastodon or whatnot

958
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,240
um the better it is for everyone because

959
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
it's just you have more control over

960
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,760
everything we're not feeding our data to

961
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,399
twitter or blah so i guess my question

962
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,159
is how do you make this appeal to people

963
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,480
who aren't like as tech savvy or

964
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,919
interested in that sort of stuff like

965
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,320
what's the driving factor i mean great

966
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,000
question and i think if there's one good

967
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,440
thing about the platforms we have right

968
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,799
now is that they're really easy to

969
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,159
approach for someone familiar with

970
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,000
facebook or twitter um they're easy to

971
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
join and you'll get an experience that's

972
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,600
similar but with a better culture that's

973
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,640
driving it

974
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,399
and so what i'm hoping is with adoption

975
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,320
comes adoption if you're on there and

976
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,679
you endlessly tell your mom to get on

977
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,600
there until she gets fed up and joins um

978
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
hopefully she will join maybe her

979
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,919
friends will join we have to kick it off

980
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,360
the thing is that activity pub is four

981
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,039
years old it hasn't kicked off yet but i

982
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,360
hope that as we see standards evolve as

983
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,519
we see the situation improve more people

984
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,600
will join and more people will join but

985
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,679
there is a thing here which is to say

986
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,960
right now most people using it are very

987
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,360
techy um and

988
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,120
i don't have a good answer for you on

989
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,480
bringing it outside of the tech universe

990
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,679
it's going to come with people hating

991
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,640
social media in aggregate as well

992
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
it'll come with time and adoption and

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,440
improvement of protocols and hopefully

994
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,880
your help and there are other people

995
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,760
standing at the microphone hello hi um

996
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,840
uh i'm sorry maybe you maybe you covered

997
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,519
this all over already and i didn't quite

998
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,960
follow it but i'm just trying to follow

999
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,840
the concept of pushing and pulling so if

1000
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,080
there's an instance and i i have

1001
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
somebody i know who's active on that

1002
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,000
instance a friend of mine set up a

1003
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
different one that i'm active on and i

1004
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,679
want to follow that person

1005
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,399
does my instance

1006
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,800
go and pull data from the other instance

1007
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,879
or does when that friend accepts my

1008
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,800
request to follow them do they push

1009
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,760
their

1010
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,839
stuff to my instance yeah that's a great

1011
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,679
question thank you for asking um and i'm

1012
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
sorry if i rush past this a little bit

1013
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,119
i've been trying to talk slower since i

1014
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,520
started talking um so what we have here

1015
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,199
with these two servers

1016
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,879
once you've posted something to your

1017
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
activity pub works on an inbox outbox

1018
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,040
system right so clients have inboxes and

1019
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,879
outboxes you'll push something from your

1020
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,119
outbox to your home server your home

1021
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,520
server then gets it in its inbox and

1022
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,760
then we'll push it to the inbox of any

1023
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,679
server that has one of your followers on

1024
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,800
it

1025
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,119
and then that's then on the inboxes of

1026
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,760
all the clients who follow you

1027
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,918
so yes to answer your quick question yes

1028
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,679
um that's how that's how the model works

1029
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,440
it's inbox outbox email json over email

1030
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,480
yes

1031
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,240
hey there um thanks again for the

1032
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,720
amazing talk uh this activity pub seems

1033
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
awesome but i had

1034
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,839
one thing that that was running through

1035
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,280
my mind when i was when you were

1036
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,359
presenting everything is that um with

1037
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,000
all the different examples of the uh of

1038
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the implementations that you showed they

1039
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,839
all seem to have text pictures and

1040
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,400
videos and i'm sure they can implement

1041
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,119
instant specific features but um the

1042
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,599
protocol itself seems like it's um it

1043
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,040
only handles the lowest common

1044
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,640
denominator kind of like email you know

1045
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,280
it handles text and maybe pictures but

1046
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,079
um

1047
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,480
i feel like um that's that that could be

1048
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
hindering adoption because all the

1049
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
platforms that you're trying to compete

1050
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,599
with like twitter instagram facebook

1051
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
they all have

1052
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,599
specific functionality that sort of

1053
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,599
drives people to the platform like

1054
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,040
instagram stories or like retweets so

1055
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,359
how does activity pub sort of handle

1056
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,720
this i don't know if i got a clear

1057
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,960
answer to that

1058
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,359
so activity pub has mechanisms for all

1059
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,280
of the common social media paradigms

1060
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,760
like boosting liking

1061
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,520
following people with follow requests

1062
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,200
activity pub has mechanisms for all of

1063
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,880
this but you're exactly right it doesn't

1064
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,320
have anything unique

1065
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
um and that's really the problem because

1066
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,280
any given any given platform or version

1067
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,119
of that activity pub software

1068
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,880
is mostly a clone of another one at this

1069
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,079
point

1070
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,839
which is what i'm talking about which is

1071
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,680
why i think that as a spec activity pub

1072
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,280
needs to change or be replaced by

1073
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,720
something which has unique features and

1074
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,400
i'm hoping that those unique features

1075
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
which don't yet exist those ideas which

1076
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
haven't yet be had been had will be had

1077
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,960
by people like you who have come to this

1078
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,079
talk and who can uh start to work on

1079
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,000
building a better social media

1080
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,200
experience i know does that answer your

1081
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,359
question it's like you're exactly right

1082
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,280
it's not that featureful it only has the

1083
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,119
features that everybody else has

1084
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,400
we don't have anything unique yet except

1085
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,240
for a culture but i'm hoping our culture

1086
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,599
will translate to new features because

1087
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,040
we have a lot of awesome people on this

1088
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,680
platform um and if you don't mind a

1089
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,760
follow-up question just i saw all the

1090
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
different like like a copy of all the

1091
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,079
different social media types like reddit

1092
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,320
and twitter in your examples is have you

1093
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,000
heard of anything that sort of mimics

1094
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
something like twitch

1095
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,599
like video streaming seems to be one

1096
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,960
thing that i didn't

1097
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,480
puretube is actually really cool and it

1098
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,520
is something with a pretty unique

1099
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
feature set i i think now i should have

1100
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
talked about it but i get the chance

1101
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,480
peer2

1102
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
uh can do two things can do hosted

1103
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,960
videos or peer-to-peer videos so anybody

1104
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
with a peer tube instance hosts videos

1105
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,640
and they can be accessed in a federated

1106
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,599
manner

1107
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,760
but you can also get these videos

1108
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,280
directly from other users who have

1109
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
opened the same video

1110
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
so it's like a little in-browser

1111
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,440
torrenting client basically and i

1112
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,119
believe peertube has support for live

1113
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,160
stuff

1114
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,000
again i don't know how complete or

1115
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,440
usable it is as a platform i haven't

1116
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,520
really tried but it is out there we have

1117
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,320
that

1118
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,560
the problem is that nobody's using it

1119
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,960
and that's the big problem

1120
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,200
thank you

1121
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,079
hi uh first i wanted to say uh thank you

1122
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,680
for this talk because

1123
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
like before this i didn't know anything

1124
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,480
about any of this stuff aside from the

1125
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
fact that like the existing options suck

1126
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
um but that doesn't you know like where

1127
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,400
do you go from that so thank you um but

1128
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
i'm wondering like that said

1129
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,240
what if i want to set up my own instance

1130
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,079
what how do i how can i do that yeah

1131
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,839
this is a really great question um right

1132
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,440
now as i said you'd probably want to run

1133
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
a mastodon instance it's just the place

1134
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
where everyone else is there's a really

1135
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,359
great service called masto.host they

1136
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,200
will create for you a managed mastodon

1137
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,560
instance which you could administrate

1138
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,320
and then they will do this has been part

1139
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,560
of everything and you can scale that as

1140
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,079
your instance grows depending on how you

1141
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,200
want to do things if you want a

1142
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
self-host too it's really easy if you

1143
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,800
have a spare vps somewhere

1144
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,040
mastodon is a ruby on rails app with a

1145
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,280
postgresql database postgre sql i don't

1146
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,359
know there's a big old warp here but

1147
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,800
yeah massdown has a rails app with a

1148
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,720
database you can implement it on a

1149
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,400
server in an afternoon it's not that

1150
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,720
hard um but if you want a really easy

1151
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,960
experience master.host is the the place

1152
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,480
to go thank you yeah

1153
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,960
hi uh it seemed like from the existing

1154
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,720
implementations that you showed that

1155
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
most of the time people who are using

1156
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,280
this protocol are mostly trying to

1157
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,960
imitate other

1158
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,680
existing social media platforms and my

1159
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,040
my question is

1160
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,320
um is anybody trying to do anything a

1161
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,240
little outside the box like um

1162
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
a social activity that always comes to

1163
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,640
mind to me is is gaming and you

1164
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,440
mentioned minecraft uh is there anybody

1165
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,720
working on uh say video game matchmaking

1166
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,560
or something like that yeah um sprightly

1167
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
is which is really cool there's a

1168
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,320
wonderful talk which i think i linked to

1169
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,000
on that qr code

1170
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,599
and if not

1171
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,599
i'll add it and i'll add it to that page

1172
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,280
in a minute spritely is attempting to

1173
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,599
create a cohesive experience where you

1174
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,040
can join a game on somebody with

1175
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,440
somebody else that's federated and with

1176
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
common items and things like that stored

1177
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,040
on respective servers all of this sort

1178
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,280
of cryptographically

1179
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,040
ensured but without the blockchain i

1180
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,320
don't know exactly how it's supposed to

1181
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,000
work out

1182
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
um

1183
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
yes there are people doing cool things

1184
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,480
none of them are usable or used yet

1185
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,680
but i encourage you to go and take a

1186
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,119
look at them and see what you can do to

1187
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,960
help all right thank you very much yeah

1188
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,720
all right

1189
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,000
on

1190
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,280
mobile apps if somebody replies to

1191
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
one of your posts is there any way for

1192
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,680
activity pub to do push notifications

1193
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,359
because typically that would be

1194
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,480
that would have to be associated with

1195
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,240
the app right but then yeah they're not

1196
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,920
the same as the servers they wouldn't

1197
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,760
that wouldn't necessarily know that's a

1198
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,359
great question

1199
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,200
it does depend on the platform so

1200
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,359
mastodon and the most of the mastodon

1201
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,880
like clients and mobile apps do have

1202
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,359
push notifications but the platform does

1203
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,880
have to implement that separately from

1204
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,640
the spec

1205
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,440
so they get the notification from so

1206
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,839
your your home server

1207
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,160
is like oh i just got a reply i'll send

1208
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,040
that to the mastodon app server and then

1209
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,599
that sends it through ios and android

1210
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,560
okay cool

1211
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,880
thank you so much real time that was a

1212
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,800
really good i'm glad i came to this talk

1213
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,720
thanks um

1214
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,800
you were talking about how activity pub

1215
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,640
is an unmaintained standard and it's

1216
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,839
just kind of

1217
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:02,720
bad

1218
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,920
um

1219
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,319
yeah okay well it's good but you know

1220
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,000
missing some features

1221
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
are there any up-and-coming

1222
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,560
new standards that

1223
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,960
aim to replace activity pub and do you

1224
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,640
think it's even worth it to

1225
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,880
try considering already we're having

1226
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,560
adoption issues

1227
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
yeah yes first of all yes it is worth it

1228
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,839
and i think we should be working on this

1229
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,599
stuff and there are people who are

1230
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,960
i i refer you back again to sprightly um

1231
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
who are doing some really cool stuff um

1232
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,920
and they have links to other

1233
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,599
organizations i think the new social is

1234
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,680
actually still maintained even if no one

1235
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,920
is using it so there are other platforms

1236
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,599
there is stuff happening the problem is

1237
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,359
that if nobody's using activity pub

1238
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,200
which is the wider standard right now

1239
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,480
very few people are going to want to

1240
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,920
implement something entirely different

1241
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,839
from

1242
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,520
that so again

1243
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,040
trying to call attention to all of this

1244
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,800
and and hope people start working on it

1245
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,119
because some people are but not enough

1246
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,520
thank you

1247
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,480
so fantastic talk by the way thanks uh

1248
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,119
before i take a swing at you um

1249
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,240
so

1250
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
you're saying that you know activity pub

1251
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,680
is a failure because there are only six

1252
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,200
million people on it was your

1253
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
expectation that within the last four

1254
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,599
years that they would displace all of

1255
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,760
facebook and twitter i mean what's the

1256
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,839
number that would make this

1257
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,079
even a reasonable success in your eyes

1258
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,880
if where they are now is so bad a great

1259
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,520
question um and i think it comes back to

1260
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,800
what i was talking about with why is

1261
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,119
social media i mean i i if you see

1262
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,760
activity pub as a way to replace and

1263
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,079
from taking power away from

1264
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,520
centralized corporate social media

1265
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,359
platforms then it's failed and i think

1266
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,040
you'll call that success when the

1267
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,800
average person who wants to sign up for

1268
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
social media account doesn't go to

1269
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
facebook they go to frendica that would

1270
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,480
be a success if you're trying to replace

1271
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,880
existing social media platforms because

1272
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
as it is right now

1273
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,960
big tech can't exactly coexist

1274
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,920
um

1275
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,119
i think when you're talking about

1276
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,880
evolving what social media looks like

1277
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,680
from a passive to an active experience

1278
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,359
that's a difficult question and i think

1279
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,359
it comes again to that point when

1280
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,440
all your friends are on it and you can

1281
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,359
see interesting things and maybe that

1282
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,200
can co-exist with existing platforms

1283
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,800
that people don't want to leave but uh

1284
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
there's not a number so much as like a a

1285
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,560
question of when is this the better

1286
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,119
experience and that relies on standards

1287
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,720
it relies on features and it relies on

1288
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,079
people to actually come and join the

1289
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,839
platforms and make them better yeah

1290
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,359
better experience is a little tough to

1291
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,119
define though it is yeah that's that's a

1292
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,200
very nebulous because i think the

1293
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,720
experience is better

1294
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,079
yeah but that's

1295
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,079
because the nerds that i like

1296
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,680
no exactly i love it makes it easy i

1297
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,960
gotta mess it on every day i get on

1298
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,280
twitter never it's great um and i think

1299
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,400
if you're looking for a good social

1300
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,079
media experience right now mastodon is

1301
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,440
the place to go

1302
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,920
but a better experience is also not just

1303
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,200
for the people sitting in this room all

1304
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,880
of whom are very smart and technical it

1305
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,319
needs to apply to everybody and again

1306
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,920
it's nebulous i don't have a good

1307
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,760
definition for you off the top of my

1308
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,960
head

1309
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
but i think that will come with time

1310
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
and uh and hopefully with participation

1311
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
that was my that was my point is it may

1312
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
take more time it does it's gonna take

1313
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,280
you can't have vc backed billion dollar

1314
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,240
company

1315
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,599
meteoric growth with no money and

1316
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,800
grassroots

1317
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,160
i think if it's going to be grassroots

1318
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,440
and it's going to be successful it's

1319
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,119
going to take time you raise a great

1320
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,440
point it is um

1321
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,319
thank you yeah thank you

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,040
you may be able to look there um you can

1333

search for instances of various

1334
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
platforms which is i think a really

1335
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,839
helpful thing and you can migrate from

1336
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,720
there but you know ask around um and and

1337

1338
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
don't know of one off the top of my head

1339
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,799
yeah

1340
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,520
a question i guess um is there any

1341
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,680
functionality planned or thought about

1342
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,720
um

1343
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,520
if you're on a federated um platform to

1344
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
pull from other platforms and then to

1345
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,280
post out to those platforms

1346
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,640
compatibility you know that kind of

1347
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,960
stuff great great question thank you um

1348
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,480
there are at this moment fetiverse

1349
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,800
mirrors between twitter and i believe

1350
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,960
also reddit so you can get posts from

1351
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,800
twitter feeds in your fetivers timeline

1352
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
and you can mirror posts from what you

1353
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
say on the fetiverse to twitter and vice

1354
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,720
versa which really does ease the

1355
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,880
transition for people so those are out

1356
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,560
there and they're pretty pretty widely

1357
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,880
used

1358
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,440
