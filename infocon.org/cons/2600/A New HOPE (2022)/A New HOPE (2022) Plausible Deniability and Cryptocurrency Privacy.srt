13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
of course that your cell phones are

14
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
silent

15
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,320

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,880
attendees as well as anyone in the room

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
that is on the matrix chat may have

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
questions asked through the chat

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,158
ask to our speakers

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
now to our next talk do you want to take

22
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,400
something

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
a lot of people think that crypto

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,520
is

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,799
secure

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
is private

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,520
the problem is that even the most secure

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
crypto currencies may not be

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
but our speakers elaine reddick arctic

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,600
right arctic bite and michelle lye

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
have some information about that that

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,719
might improve your privacy

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
all right thank you for the intro uh

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
sounds like the audio is working

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,800
nice to meet everybody we can't see you

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
at all i have no idea how many people

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,920
are out there but this is what you say

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
it's like stage acting or something it's

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
just kind of exciting so

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
good uh yeah good privacy you guys are

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,040
in the um

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,879
the anonymity set which we'll talk about

43
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,280
in a few minutes public blockchain here

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
exactly

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
um yeah i guess we're the we're the main

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
chain here um yeah so

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,319
um you know

48
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,200
tools like bitcoin and ethereum not even

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
to mention privacy focused

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,280
cryptocurrencies like zcash monero and a

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
few others that we'll talk about um

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,480
have great potential to

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
have an application in privacy to be

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,239
used in kind of a secure private fashion

55
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,440
obviously they have

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
additional properties that are really

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,959
nice like censorship resistance that we

58
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,080
all care about

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
uh however just to lay the

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,440
the stage for kind of what we're going

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,879
to be speaking about here for the next

62
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
hour um

63
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
there's some nuance there right so uh i

64
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,000
mean i i

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
i imagine probably many or most or even

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
all of you are kind of aware of the fact

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
that like by default transactions on

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
networks like bitcoin and ethereum are

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
actually completely public and visible

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,599
um and you know many people conflate

71
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
ideas like pseudonymity and anonymity

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
right so you'll actually see for example

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,599
many journalists writing articles about

74
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,280
how you know there are quote unquote

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,000
anonymous you know shadowy supercoder uh

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
types using anonymous transactions on

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
networks like bitcoin well in fact

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,319
they're not anonymous they're actually

79
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,840
pseudonymous

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,959
and

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,480
there have been a number of high profile

82
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,239
cases where

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,319
criminals in particular

84
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,879
have been identified de-anonymized and

85
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
um and busted

86
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,239
and and of course privacy is something

87
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,360
that matters to all of us so what we're

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,040
going to talk about here in the next

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,080
hour

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
um just lay the groundwork talk about

91
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
kind of why these things matter to us

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,959
and why we should all care about these

93
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,480
things

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,239
talk about some of the the weaknesses

95
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
and vulnerabilities and common mistakes

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
that we see people make

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
and we'll talk a little bit about what

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
you can do about that and how to

99
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,599
maintain plausible deniability what that

100
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
matters why it matters

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,640
um and i'll also just put in a

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
mention up front here that we are really

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
fortunate to have a workshop this

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,798
evening so at 7 30 p.m we have about

105
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
three hours we have time to go quite

106
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,358
deep so 7 30 until about 10 30 p.m on

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
the fourth floor of the main building i

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
don't have the room in front of me but

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,000
one of those rooms up there we're going

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,919
to be doing a very very deep dive so

111
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,280
you'll get kind of a high-level

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
introduction to a lot of these ideas

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
tools et cetera here and then if you're

114
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
interested in joining and doing a deep

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
dive bring your laptop we'll walk you

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,680
through

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
the case studies in more detail

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,919
some more background and then we'll dive

119
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,840
into like specific tools you can use how

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,000
to use them to maintain strong privacy

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,919
on cryptographic networks all right so

122
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,000
with that out of the way uh let's do

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
some quick intros um so

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
to my far right we have a b you want to

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
quickly introduce yourself yeah hi my

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
name is arctic bite and um yeah i've got

127
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,560
a background in the cryptocurrency space

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
from close to the beginning as one of

129
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,880
the earliest scaled-up minds in the u.s

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,160
implementing fpga and asic technologies

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,800
and yeah privacy has been a huge part of

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,880
my motivation to get a part of uh the

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
space but also you know as we start you

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,280
know seeing the you know kind of

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
corporatocracy taking more and more of

136
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
our privacy over the years um it's just

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,120
become more of a feeling you know it

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,919
feels very good to remain relatively

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,720
private and give away as little data as

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
possible about yourself when you're

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
interacting online and cryptocurrency

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,479
offers an amazing opportunity to you

143
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,639
know at least pay for things privately

144
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,080
as well as you know empower a lot of

145
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
other services that can be privacy by

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,759
default

147
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,560
um

148
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
but yeah that's uh that's that's a lot

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
of it for me

150

full-time job at anchorage in san

155
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,680

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,639
custodians and since then i've worked

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,120
with the payment processor called bitpay

159
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,759
you can pay merchants in crypto and a

160
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,600
payment processor will basically settle

161
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,080
to the merchant in fiat so it makes

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,400
everything very easy for everybody

163
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440

network called solana it's called light

169
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,720
protocol

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
i was on the first

171
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,479
grant board at the zcash ecosystem where

172
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,479
we gave out

173
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520
zcash or zek grants to people building

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
on top of zcash but we also had a broad

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
enough mandate so that we could

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
give a almost one million dollar grant

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
to the tor foundation to build a tor

178
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
implementation and the reason it was

179
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,639
important for zcash is that it allows

180
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
somebody to run a zcash node with

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,479
network level privacy

182
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,520
so that's my background and why i care

183
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,318
about privacy

184
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
i grew up in a pretty conservative

185
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,759
conformist kind of environment and i

186
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,840
think it was then where i always looked

187
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,120
at things a little bit differently than

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
the people around me and i felt like

189
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
it was it was it's very controlling when

190
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,560
when people can look at what you're

191
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,720
doing everything you're doing and have

192
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
opinions on what you should do should

193
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,800
think should say and that for me was the

194
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,319
core of when i started feeling like

195
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,639
people should have privacy because

196
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,440
uh

197
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
you know to the extent i want freedom in

198
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
how i think other people should also

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,680
have freedom in what they think

200
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,199
and we should not

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
we should protect ourselves from being

202
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,520
prejudiced by everyone being able to

203
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,639
selectively disclose uh themselves to

204
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,240
each other that's why even though i'm

205
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
very paranoid about sharing my personal

206
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,160
information i still have a facebook

207
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
account because it's all to me it's

208
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
about selective disclosure

209
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,360
all right thanks for that intro

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
um yeah so

211
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,800
by way of background uh i

212
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
was formerly an ethereum core developer

213
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,919
so i worked for the ethereum foundation

214
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,360
for a couple of years

215
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,319
um

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,360
and

217
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,520
for the past three to four years i've

218
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,639
been helping um sorry i'm lane i skipped

219
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
skipped my name um and for the past

220
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,479
three to four years i've been um working

221
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
on a new

222
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,720
um layer one smart contract blockchain

223
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
platform called space mesh uh and yeah i

224
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,880
mean privacy is something that i as a

225
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,039
core developer think about every day and

226
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
we think about constantly as we're kind

227
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
of designing our protocol

228
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
um as well as just like thinking about

229
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
the p2p layer the networking layer how

230
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,279
transactions propagate across the

231
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,480
network et cetera et cetera so we'll

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
talk about all that stuff

233
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
another word on why privacy matters to

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,480
me since i guess we're all talking about

235
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
that um i don't remember who said it

236
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
this way i think it may have been zuko

237
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,760
of zika zcash

238
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
um

239
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,320
that

240
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,839
everything

241
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
that we take for granted in society

242
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,160
today so every kind of social innovation

243
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,720
right started out

244
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
as

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
seditious right whether that's democracy

246
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
whether that's same-sex marriage

247
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
reproductive rights whether that's

248
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,279
bitcoin and the concept of money being

249
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,880
detached from the nation-state i mean

250
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,519
all these things like that we today

251
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,160
regard as or at least most of us regard

252
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
as as highly valuable socially and

253
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
really important aspects of the social

254
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
fabric of our lives like these things

255
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
all started among you know small groups

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
of people

257
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
friends trusted contacts chatting in the

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
back of a room somewhere in private and

259
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,959
if they didn't have that technology the

260
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,320
ability to have these conversations and

261
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
spread these ideas in private then i

262
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,519
think socially we'd be in a very

263
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
backwards place today so i think this is

264
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,279
why privacy is so important like we need

265
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,959
protected spaces in our society to

266
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,920
push

267
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,839
seditious ideas forward in a nutshell

268
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,279
that's why privacy matters to me and

269
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,120
it's getting harder and harder yeah we

270
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
were we're actually missing one speaker

271
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
he couldn't make it here in time but

272
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,399
he is the

273
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
legal counsel at nim it's a privacy

274
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,240
focused is he legal counsel uh chief uh

275
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
[Music]

276
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,519
chief well he's an important person and

277
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,959
chief legal officer what is the word for

278
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,959
that chief uh in-house chief

279
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
he's got a long list of accolades he's a

280
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
he's a professor at boston university

281
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,880
he's got specialization in cyber

282
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
security and crime he represented

283
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,680
chelsea manning

284
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,000
also i think 40 guantanamo bay um

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
detainees detainees and uh i think i

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,040
really i really appreciate when we were

287
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
preparing for this uh panel his

288
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
uh his point of view was

289
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,480
it's it's about prisons and and i think

290
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
um

291
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
there's a lot of people say if you have

292
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
nothing to hide you know well then why

293
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
are you nervous and and he put it very

294
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,200
well which is you have nothing to hide

295
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,399
today

296
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,320
but what about tomorrow when societies

297
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,800
change you know who knew that today

298
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
searching for abortion clinics could be

299
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,839
a problem

300
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
and so over a long enough lifetime as

301
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
societies change as values change

302
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
everyone will have something to hide

303
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,120
and if you go to prison because of

304
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,680
something you you did um you know an

305
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,600
innocent search or an innocent thing a

306
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
meeting you went to 20 years ago that

307
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
feels very unfair

308
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
no well put and you know i'll just add

309
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
to that just you know so this i don't

310
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
think it's a very hard sell to this

311
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,760
audience like why privacy is important

312
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,279
but just bringing it slightly back to

313
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,360
the topic of kind of cryptocurrency i

314
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
believe that it's a human right that

315
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,680
people should be able to transact

316
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
privately as well

317
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
um okay so let's dive in um

318
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
let's start with basics would you guys

319
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,160
each mind just giving me a definition of

320
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
privacy like what does privacy mean to

321
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
you michelle do you want to go first

322
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,079
uh i covered it i think in my intro it's

323
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
selective disclosure i don't mean to

324
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
hide everything i definitely have

325
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,079
friends who who hide a lot of things

326
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,680
uh you know

327
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
who they are the online trail they only

328
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
use certain kinds of browsers they're

329
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,760
always under vpn they don't they deleted

330
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
facebook many many years ago et cetera i

331
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
have friends who are like that and at

332
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
some point in my life i decided

333
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,720
i i think i went off facebook but then

334
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,800
it came back when i realized that you do

335
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,360
get a lot of things out of social media

336
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,959
and being part of a community you just

337
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,959
need to to me you need to be able to

338
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,440
choose where you draw the line like and

339
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,519
maybe maybe my line's not that straight

340
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,959
right it's not all or nothing or it's

341
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
not everything i kind of want to draw my

342
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,880
own funny pattern of what i share and

343
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
what i don't share so to me it's about

344
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,320
being able to selectively disclose

345
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,360
i think that's a really important point

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,839
just to reemphasize like when i naively

347
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,600
began thinking about privacy it felt

348
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
very black and white it's kind of like

349
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
things are either public or private but

350
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
it it's yeah i think it's very nuanced

351
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
as michelle's describing it it's more

352
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,279
about selective disclosure it's more

353
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,040
about like to put it in technical terms

354
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
access control lists you know all the

355
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,639
like various pieces of my life whether

356
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,560
it's photos or stories or or documents

357
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
or content or even just aspects of my

358
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,480
identity i want to be able to control

359
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
in almost like concentric circles like

360
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
who has access to those things the most

361
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,079
trusted people you know family friends

362
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,320
the general public etc a.b

363
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
yeah um i definitely agree with those

364
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,560
notions of access control uh currently

365
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,839
i'm running an experiment where i'm

366
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
trying to kind of just not give any kind

367
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
of data to anybody other than you know

368
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
close friends family and

369
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,360
you pull the mic a little bit closer to

370
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,240
you yeah yeah absolutely so you know i

371
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
think privacy is definitely um just the

372
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
ability to express freely um i think

373
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
that you know there's this kind of like

374
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
thought running in the back of our minds

375
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
when we know that we're being surveilled

376
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,440
i mean there's been experiments that

377
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,480
prove this

378
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
you know that you know if if you believe

379
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,959
if you know even subconsciously or if

380
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
you're used to somebody constantly

381
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,480
monitoring your your activities your

382
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,839
conversations your thoughts you're going

383
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,519
to act differently and i think it's

384
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,040
really important to

385
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,920
just continue you know evolving in a um

386
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
in a natural way in a way that you know

387
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,120
is is um you know most aligned with you

388
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,639
know what we truly believe inside of

389
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,800
ourselves and feel that

390
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
again like lane said having those open

391
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
spaces to to keep moving forward is

392
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
really critical and increasingly

393
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
difficult um so yeah the experiment i'm

394
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
writing currently is you know can i you

395
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
know essentially be private from

396
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
like sharing information for with

397
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
everybody except for you know government

398
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
entities and banks um because those are

399
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,279
obviously very hard to get around but

400
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,440
you know other than that um yeah

401
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
remaining private is kind of like an

402
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,399
experiment that i'm running right now

403
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,120
mostly to see how it feels and um yeah

404
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,800
so far so far so good

405
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,279
so you said you want to

406
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,720
just close information everyone except

407
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,000
governments and banks right did i get

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,360
that correct so

409
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,399
how

410
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,040
let's start with the basics

411
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
yeah there's a long list of things to do

412
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
and you know for instance you know

413
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,600
setting up anonymous um you know legal

414
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
structures for ownership of your home

415
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
paying bills this kind of thing um but

416
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,160
it really starts on technology i mean

417
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,440
this is where we leak the most data

418
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,160
obviously so it requires setting up a

419
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,040
like

420
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
like a privacy preserving operating

421
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,440
system

422
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,560
and and

423
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,880
both for you know your computer and your

424
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,399
phone um and it goes from there um so we

425
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,480
can we can dive kind of deep into that

426
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,800
but i think the the um

427
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,079
to stick to the topic of like

428
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,560
cryptocurrency privacy um it might be

429
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
worthwhile going over

430
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
kind of the the areas where assuming

431
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,320
that you know you haven't already

432
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
connected your crypto account to your

433
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,279
real identity in some way for instance

434
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,120
you went and at this conference or

435
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
somewhere else you purchased some

436
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
cryptocurrency with cash anonymously

437
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
and that person doesn't know who you are

438
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,880
then

439
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,120
what uh how can you leak data going

440
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,880
forward from there

441
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
that might lead to discovery of you know

442
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,720
who you are for instance maybe you want

443
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
to donate maybe you live in a very

444
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
impressive country that doesn't support

445
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
donation to you know efforts that are

446
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
here today like eff free software

447
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,440
foundation this kind of thing um

448
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
so maybe you want to keep those kind of

449
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,279
activities that you want to you know

450
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
support private um

451
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
you know in normal crypto networks such

452
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
as bitcoin ethereum you know the sending

453
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,519
address or account is necessarily

454
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,440
exposed to revealing all associated

455
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
transactions with that account

456
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
um so this is the easiest way to

457
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,279
identify you know who the owner of a

458
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,680
wallet is in particular um and it starts

459
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,279
really with um you know if you

460
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,880
accidentally you know pay for something

461
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
where there's an order in your name and

462
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
that company is like you know sharing

463
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
that data with data miners i mean then

464
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,279
you're linked

465
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,600
and um obviously if you put any

466
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
exchanges where you've you know

467
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,199
identified yourself

468
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,560
that's a thing um but going a bit deeper

469
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,279
you know the most common ways when to

470
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,600
you know reveal data about yourself

471
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,839
is um you know anybody can

472
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,480
run like a global cluster of nodes um on

473
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
any blockchain network that basically

474
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,440
monitor for where transactions are

475
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,519
first seed on the network and this can

476
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
help locate exactly where you are or at

477
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,480
least roughly your ip address range of

478
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,959
like where you probably are in the world

479
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,920
um

480
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,440
and

481
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,040
this is really

482
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,119
trivial to get around actually by using

483
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
you know proxy chains and you know

484
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,799
timers and and you know deploying

485
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,959
transactions and prop making it seem

486
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,079
like they originate from different

487
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
points in the world to kind of

488
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
isolate or separate that activity from

489
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,039
yourself but by default this isn't done

490
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,240
at all

491
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,319
most people connect to a publicly

492
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,240
available endpoint run by a centralized

493
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,520
company because that's easier than

494
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,880
running your own node and that publicly

495
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
available endpoint receives your ip

496
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,360
address and probably other data that um

497
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,840
that that is included in the transaction

498
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,799
um

499
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,960
and we do know some of these uh endnotes

500
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,440
these rpc endpoints have been

501
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,799
you know subpoenaed for for ip addresses

502
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,120
yes that's a really important note

503
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,840
and um yeah this this is an example of

504
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,400
you know um yeah this data getting out

505
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,520
in the public

506
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,559
um

507
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,880
there's also uh you know another common

508
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
data gathering point in crypto networks

509
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,840
is block explorers so it's a website

510
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,600
like etherscan or you know

511
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,320
blockchain.infoblockchain.com where you

512
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,679
go to

513
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,440
you know look at your transaction

514
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,480
history

515
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,000
you know let's say i'm the only one

516
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
who's ever looked up you know addresses

517
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
a b and c they can be pretty sure that

518
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
you know all the information associated

519
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,559
with my my machine is now linked to

520
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,559
those addresses and that can be used to

521
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,160
you know track further down the line not

522
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
only ip address but operating system and

523
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
everything that's exposed when you visit

524
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
a website normally

525
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,000
um

526
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,320
so so yeah these are these are the most

527
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
common ways that you know

528
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
that

529
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
people kind of leak data around

530
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
ownership of addresses when otherwise

531
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
they could be

532
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,360
anonymous so a.b some of the tools and

533
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,440
techniques that you mentioned like proxy

534
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
chains and you know vpns tour etc these

535
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
sound pretty useful are you going to

536
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,880
show us how to use these at the panel

537
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,799
sorry at the workshop this evening yeah

538
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
absolutely it's actually not too

539
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
difficult to set up these things it just

540
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360
requires the um diligence

541
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,840
to you know remember to use them and

542
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,000
ideally bake in those those habits as

543
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,200
automatic um yeah privacy is definitely

544
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
not convenient um but uh yeah

545
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,559
um michelle what are a couple of

546
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,320
examples of

547
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,679
techniques or tools or techniques i

548
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,520
guess that have worked well for you with

549
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
respect to sort of maintaining strong

550
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,360
privacy while transacting with

551
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
cryptocurrency on cryptographic networks

552
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,559
yeah i think for me the main one is

553
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,480
i don't do anything too fancy

554
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,679
not as you know at that that level um

555
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,200
but i think for me the important thing

556
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
is to

557
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,120
kind of be clear which wallets you use

558
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
for which purposes like if you if you

559
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,559
sign up for some of these crypto

560
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
conferences as part of your application

561
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
process to go to a conference they ask

562
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
you for an address so that clearly is an

563
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,200
address that you know anyone could know

564
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
and uh to the extent you don't want to

565
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
be targeted or you simply want to

566
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
preserve your you know your own privacy

567
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,480
i think you need to be smart about who

568
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,039
you disclose what information to um i

569
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,840
think a lot of people also

570
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,440
practice actually probably not enough

571
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
people practice kind of using a new

572
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,679
wallet every time you you engage in a

573
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,200
new transaction and for different

574
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
blockchains whether they're there's this

575
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,280
concept of a utxo blockchain versus a

576
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
balance based blockchain it's it's a

577
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
little bit easier in the first to kind

578
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,559
of have michelle what's the difference

579
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,480
between a utxo and

580
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
an account based blockchain

581
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
okay can we get the the tldr actually

582
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,799
can you do that tldr so utxo stands for

583
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,960
unspent transaction output so bitcoin

584
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
and its derivatives so this includes

585
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
projects like zcash for example um are

586
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,200
utxo based and so the best way to think

587
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
about a utxo is it's like a bill in your

588
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
wallet right so it's kind of like in the

589
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
case of where you could think of it as a

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
coin in the case of bitcoin

591
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,559
and so you can like a transaction

592
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,320
consists of kind of giving like imagine

593
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,000
giving someone 100 build and then

594
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,840
getting like 75 change or something

595
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
right so this is how transactions work

596
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,679
in the bitcoin network um

597
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,200
you you you you hand you you you send a

598
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,720
large note to the network and then a

599
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,799
piece of that gets sent to the recipient

600
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,840
and then you get changed back uh and so

601
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,440
a wallet in a network like bitcoin and

602
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,679
utxo network like bitcoin is like a

603
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,960
physical wallet right there's a metaphor

604
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,400
there where it actually has

605
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
you can again imagine like actual

606
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,200
physical notes in that wallet each of

607
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,880
those is a utxo that you can go on and

608
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
spend and give to someone else um the

609
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,559
paradigm is totally different in an

610
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,240
account based network like ethereum

611
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,760
where you

612
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,480
so

613
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,640
the reason is because the way that

614
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,559
how do i talk about this uh

615
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,600
there's a notion of an account with

616
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,880
state in it in the ethereum virtual

617
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
machine right it's like a bank account

618
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,360
like a bank account exactly and so you

619
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,559
have a balance that goes up and down as

620
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,720
you receive and send transactions so

621
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
naively the the former is better for

622
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
privacy and the latter is worse for

623
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
privacy right because in in in an

624
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,440
account based system like ethereum by

625
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,679
default if you don't make any attempt or

626
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
effort to like increase your privacy all

627
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
your transactions are flowing into and

628
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,960
out of the same account with the same

629
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,320
what's called address which again is

630
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
like your bank account number uh having

631
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
said that there are a lot of tools and

632
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
techniques you can use to increase

633
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,600
privacy on on that point i think a point

634
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
of interest is um

635
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,280
given that there's there are two kinds

636
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,080
of blockchains in in this fashion

637
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,640
when satoshi published his paper at

638
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
first he he gave a bullet point summary

639
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,320
of what it was his third bullet point is

640
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,360
that participants can transact

641
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,960
anonymously and the only reason he

642
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,240
thought that would be possible is

643
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
through this utxo system

644
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,640
whereas any other system would would

645
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
probably not qualify of course what he

646
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
he didn't expect bitcoin to be so

647
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,039
successful and have billions and

648
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,960
billions of dollars thrown at blockchain

649
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,159
analysis

650
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,840
and so anonymous is the best

651
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,159
pseudonymous today

652
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,159
yeah so just to restate um

653
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,559
even though utxo based systems work a

654
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,480
little bit more like cache

655
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,559
they're not you don't get strong privacy

656
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,080
out of the box and we will in the

657
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
workshop later today go through some

658
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,159
examples of de-anonymization attacks

659
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
that have actually happened some in

660
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,640
theory some that have actually happened

661
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
in practice and will actually try to do

662
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,159
some live de-anonymization of

663
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,360
transactions on the blockchain which

664
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,679
should be fun um and in the case of

665
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,799
account-based networks like ethereum um

666
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,440
so i said with utxo based systems they

667
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,559
sound like they give you better privacy

668
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,760
you don't actually get strong privacy

669
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,919
out of the box and uh the opposite is

670
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,919
also true which is that it is possible

671
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,679
to have strong privacy even in an

672
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,200
account-based system like ethereum even

673
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,480
though it's it's even worse out of the

674
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,520
box and we'll go through some of those

675
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,000
techniques later as well

676
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,919
that's a mouthful okay

677
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,720
um and your favorite technique yeah i

678
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,559
would say

679
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,200
what do i do that works well so

680
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
again i would say the most basic things

681
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
you can do okay the most the most

682
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,799
obvious obvious thing is like use a vpn

683
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,720
like always everywhere

684
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
at home you know on your mobile device

685
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
et cetera that's just like out of the

686
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
box that helps enormously because it

687
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,360
makes it harder to establish those links

688
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,279
that ab alluded to between like your ip

689
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,000
address and your wallet addresses and

690
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,840
your actual transactions as i'm sure

691
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,039
folks here are aware if you have

692
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,480
someone's ip address you have an

693
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,679
enormous amount of information about

694
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,120
that person and where they are

695
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
um

696
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,919
and i think the other thing is just good

697
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,799
management of wallets and addresses um

698
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,000
so

699
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,279
you know we have these beautiful

700
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,880
standards there's one called bip32 so

701
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
bip refers to a bitcoin improvement

702
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,240
proposal

703
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
which lays out an algorithm for

704
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,400
something called a hierarchical

705
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,080
deterministic wallet and the way this

706
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,760
works if you've ever used basically any

707
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,360
cryptocurrency wallet you will have seen

708
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
like a seed phrase which is usually a 12

709
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
or 24 word phrase um that's like your

710
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,480
your seed root phrase and i mean that's

711
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,320
just maps to a cryptographic to a number

712
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,480
to a private key but then using this

713
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,240
this bip 32 kind of deterministic

714
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,080
algorithm you can actually spawn an

715
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,480
unlimited number of fresh wallet

716
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
addresses from that single seed

717
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,320
uh and and again all modern

718
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,840
cryptocurrency wallets support this but

719
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,120
they don't all make it easy out of the

720
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,080
box and so i guess as michelle said like

721
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
i guess the best practice and something

722
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,559
that i try really hard to do is um to

723
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,919
always use a fresh address for every

724
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,760
application for every we talked before

725
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
about how privacy is selective

726
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
disclosure and i in my mind i have a

727
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
notion of kind of concentric circles so

728
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
it's not that you can never reuse an

729
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,360
address but like transacting within a

730
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,279
single context like within the context

731
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,559
of a single application or a single

732
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,919
community or a single group of people i

733
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,080
try to you know just be cognizant of

734
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,600
which address is used for each of those

735
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,960
it's hard because there are many of them

736
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
and again the the wallet software is not

737
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
amazing

738
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
there there's a lot of bitcoin on the

739
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,279
blockchain that's just locked because

740
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,679
people forgot their keys they mismanaged

741
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,440
it the

742
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,799
hard drive got sent to the trash pile

743
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,799
we all have stories of this believe me

744
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,840
anyone who's been in the space for more

745
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
than a year or two like definitely has

746
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,720
versions of the story ab what's your

747
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,760
version you've been you've been here

748
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,279
longer than

749
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,279
most of us i i saw a forum post in the

750
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,559
early days um where satoshi the you know

751
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,960
this anonymous group that you know

752
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,080
supposedly invented bitcoin um satoshi

753
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,559
said you know never delete private keys

754
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,080
you might need them at some point so

755
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,440
yeah um

756
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
i've never lost any

757
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
so far

758
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,440
but yeah that's the really beautiful

759
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
part about crypto is you know you can

760
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,960
keep unlimited backups and you can

761
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
secure those using any kind of

762
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,159
cryptographic means that you'd like you

763
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,440
know for instance shamira's secret

764
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,799
sharing scheme i'm sure some of you are

765
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,799
familiar with that for various purpose

766
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,640
um using that to store crypto keys is

767
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
amazing because you can you know store

768
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,799
it in m event places and

769
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
as long as m

770
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
of those aren't compromised or lost

771
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
you still are in control and you can

772
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,080
also in the setup canaries in those

773
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
places so then you know if somebody's

774
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,000
like making moves to compromise your

775
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,919
account you can you can

776
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
migrate to a new more secure setup so

777
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,360
this is extremely powerful for just the

778
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,880
ability to you know securely hold

779
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,440
assets of any kind that are you know

780
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,200
digital um but yeah to uh to your guys's

781
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
point with uh

782
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,039
you know addresses utxo it just really

783
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,480
depends on your avatar adversary um for

784
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,400
instance one popular technique if you

785
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
don't want you know on the public

786
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,320
network uh to reveal you know all these

787
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,600
addresses you don't want accounts to be

788
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,240
linked um and your exchange like for

789
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
instance you have an exchange who you

790
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,279
trust to not share your info and you

791
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,440
know government isn't your adversary the

792
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
exchange isn't because they you know are

793
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,880
supposedly keeping that information

794
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,600
private um then one popular method to

795
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
achieve blockchain blockchain level

796
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,159
security or privacy is um is basically

797
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,360
just to make a withdrawal from an

798
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
exchange to a new account for each

799
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,919
purpose that you use um for each each

800
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,360
one of those new wallets that you create

801
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,240
that way you're not sending a

802
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,919
transaction transaction from your old

803
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
wallet to your new wallet which you know

804
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,120
if you're sending the entire balance

805
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,240
it's pretty obvious that you're just

806
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,360
migrating accounts so yeah so that's

807
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,200
that's one popular method that's easy to

808
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,000
use

809
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,919
there are other services that

810
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,720
can

811
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,559
basically take the place of the exchange

812
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,640
as a mixer in that place and you can use

813
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,640
fully you know cryptographically um

814
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,159
executed

815
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,320
mixers which exist as smart contracts on

816
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,159
various networks can you explain the

817
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,120
concept of the mixer sure yeah like a

818
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
mixer in essence is a place where

819
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,279
it's usually ideally a smart contract

820
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,480
that's running autonomously where you

821
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,760
can view the source code and make sure

822
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,960
that you agree with everything that's

823
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,399
going to happen

824
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,919
that basically accepts a lot of inputs

825
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,399
from a lot of different users and allows

826
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,320
those users to withdraw the same amount

827
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,640
that they've put in in a blockchain kind

828
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,880
of situation where all the transaction

829
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,000
inputs are public um basically it's a

830
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
requirement to standardize the amounts

831
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
that you're inputting so that way it

832
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,279
can't be identified for instance you

833
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,360
know if i input you know five michelle

834
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
puts in three lane puts in one and then

835
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,399
we all make those same withdrawals it's

836
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,600
pretty obvious who's who at the end of

837
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,320
that

838
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,200
so um so yeah standardizing the amounts

839
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,360
um adding them all to a pool and giving

840
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,880
certificates which cryptographic

841
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
certificates would allow you to redeem

842
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,559
the amount you deposited prior

843
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,880
that's the basic concept of a mixer

844
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,399
that could be used to the same effect as

845
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,919
what i mentioned in exchange for this

846
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,520
that's directly linked to the title of

847
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,960
this panel which is plausible

848
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
deniability so

849
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,679
this

850
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,559
whoever took a coin from this pool

851
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,919
this joined pool um it's not clear which

852
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,200
input uh provided that output

853
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,279
yeah so let's just i mean i had a note

854
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,799
on this i think it is worth mentioning

855
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,159
like i think we all have an intuition

856
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,760
for plausible deniability means but

857
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
there is an actual like cryptographic

858
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,480
definition which is k anonymity right so

859
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
i'm just going to read this generally

860
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,679
speaking a k anonymized data set has the

861
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,200
property that each record is

862
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
indistinguishable from at least k minus

863
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,440
one others this is the size of the

864
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
privacy set or anonymity set

865
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,279
specifically if a mixer contract which

866
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,840
ab was just describing holds n deposits

867
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
out of which n minus k had already been

868
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,440
withdrawn in other words k are still

869
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,679
remaining then the next withdrawal will

870
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,679
be indistinguishable among at least

871
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,360
those k users who have not withdrawn

872
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,600
from the mixer yet

873
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
right so basically

874
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,559
each

875
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,640
person who's withdrawing from this mixer

876
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,480
has transaction privacy

877
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
that makes them indistinguishable from

878
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,679
among at least k different addresses so

879
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,279
i mean that's just just it's pretty

880
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,039
simple math but just keep this in mind

881
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,120
like when we talk about privacy when we

882
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,559
talk about plausible deniability like

883
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,480
this is the kind of rigorous definition

884
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
at the same time if not used properly

885
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
with all the

886
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,399
usual safeguards what what can happen is

887
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,399
people can de-mix and that's what

888
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,080
happened um

889
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,919
more recently where

890
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,440
um a

891
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,679
user of a wasabi wallet was demixed

892
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,159
and they were arrested

893
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,240
uh yeah so okay we're jumping on a

894
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,480
little bit so there are so mixers are

895
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,080
really a really important topic so there

896
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,159
are mixers in the ethereum network like

897
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,840
tornado cache which is quite well known

898
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,799
and zk what is it called

899
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,760
sorry the layer 2 the not zk sync

900
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,559
uh the the aztec that's that yeah money

901
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,039
gk money and then in bitcoin world there

902
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,000
uh

903
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
our wallet software there's tools like

904
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,600
samurai wallet and um and wasabi wallet

905
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
and we're gonna we don't have time on

906
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,799
this panel nor do we have like the av

907
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,320
setup to kind of like demo these things

908
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,000
but we're going to do that all uh sorry

909
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,840
i keep plugging the workshop later so

910
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,960
you'll get a chance to roll up your

911
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,720
sleeves and play with those tools there

912
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,840
um

913
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,279
okay so let's so yeah so let's stay on

914
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,480
topic of mixtures for a few minutes

915
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,519
because this is actually like a very

916
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,960
concrete

917
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,159
powerful tool we can use um but

918
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,480
people make common mistakes with them

919
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,360
and so

920
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,320
like

921
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,880
one example of a mistake people make is

922
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
not waiting long enough to withdraw

923
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,120
right so if you deposit into a mixer um

924
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,799
the way these things work is they allow

925
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,480
deposits in specific amounts right so

926
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
let's look at like tornado cash allows

927
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,600
like point one eighth one eighth tenth

928
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,960
hundred something like this basically

929
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,360
powers of ten and you need to wait some

930
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,960
minimum period of time

931
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,840
to withdraw your coins from the mixer to

932
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
allow the size of that anonymity set to

933
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,120
grow in other words if you just deposit

934
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,640
your coins and take them out right away

935
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,799
then uh the anonymity set is much

936
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,840
smaller and it's much easier to

937
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
establish a link

938
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,440
another mistake i mean there's many

939
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,679
mistakes people make another one is uh

940
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,440
not randomizing the time intervals right

941
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,600
so if you have a tendency to deposit

942
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,799
things then take them out one day later

943
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,320
and you kind of repeat yourself again

944
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,679
and again like you're leaking metadata

945
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,159
as you do this and so um it would be

946
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,519
ideal if the wallet software

947
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,360
were designed in such a way that this

948
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,720
could be automated and i'm not aware of

949
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,679
wallet software that's this

950
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,039
sophisticated yet but they are getting

951
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,960
better yeah not yet and

952
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,279
time zone is a huge metric for

953
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,000
correlating ownership of wallets um or

954
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
at least location of origin of all it's

955
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,200
you know if you're only sending

956
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,799
transactions between you know nine to

957
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,039
five new york time uh in the entire

958
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,880
history of ethereum account for instance

959
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,559
which you can very easily see or even

960
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,240
with a chain of bitcoin addresses where

961
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,559
you can quite clearly see you know that

962
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,399
a change amount is going to be kind of a

963
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
random amount because the fee size is

964
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
variable and has a bunch of like random

965
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
seeming decimal places it's quite easy

966
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,440
to trace kind of like the originator of

967
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,279
that address and as that goes through

968
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,880
the utxo chain

969
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,399
um

970
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,399
like who's the account that's still in

971
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,159
control of the original balance minus

972
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,799
what's been spent um but yeah time zone

973
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,200
is a huge one so a wallet software which

974
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,000
did

975
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,840
which will inc incorporate you know

976
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,159
randomization of both you know ip

977
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,919
address where it's originated from and

978
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,480
time zone um is is critical yeah

979
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,480
no yeah i think you can just pull the

980
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
microphone a little bit closer too okay

981
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,120
uh good yeah time zone

982
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,720
like so

983
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
i mean i actually think about this a lot

984
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,840
it's kind of funny like should i

985
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,240
uh just set my alarm clock so i wake up

986
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,679
at random times of the night to like

987
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,679
transact if i want i mean i'm i'm half

988
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,120
joking i'm half serious but like again

989
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
like ideally wallet software would do

990
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,919
this for us right we're not there yet

991
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,600
but this just goes to show that there is

992
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,039
enormous scope for any hackers in the

993
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,600
room like you can add incredible value

994
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
to the world i think into these networks

995
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,960
by uh implementing even some of these

996
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
like basic basic basic things that

997
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,760
haven't been implemented yet yeah for

998
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
instance just like a decentralized

999
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,760
service that requires no trust by the

1000
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,240
user that you know where you guarantee

1001
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,159
that a transaction will be broadcasted

1002
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,080
randomly within the next 48 hours you

1003
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,679
know that would be a tremendous service

1004
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,360
to people the problem with uh

1005
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,480
implementing that

1006
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,720
you know in a centralized way is there's

1007
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
the avenue for censorship you're

1008
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,559
probably going to knock on the door from

1009
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,559
our friends and also the alphabet soup

1010
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,440
um

1011
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
while we're on this topic here's another

1012
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,960
fun one are you aware of the gas price

1013
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,799
de-anonymization in mixers have you

1014
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,079
noticed this one at all this is

1015
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,000
something i was reading about um

1016
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,119
so

1017
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,800
more sophisticated so most users who are

1018
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,480
using a network like ethereum will not

1019
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,679
pay attention to gas and they'll just

1020
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,520
like use whatever default gas price

1021
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,280
their wallet software like metamask

1022
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,879
whatever just suggests for them which it

1023
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,639
often calculates based on how busy the

1024
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,000
network is at a given point in time and

1025
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,440
how fast you want your network your

1026
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,119
transaction to be confirmed more

1027
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,560
sophisticated users will often do a

1028
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,239
thing and i'm guilty of this myself

1029
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,520
sometimes where i just feel that i have

1030
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,119
i can i can estimate the required gas

1031
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,040
better than my wallet can

1032
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,800
and i'm often right and so i'll like

1033
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,399
manually specify a gas price but it

1034
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,480
turns out that if you do this

1035
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
you're leaking metadata again right and

1036
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,399
so if you do this regularly or if you

1037
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,320
just set a gas price manually and then

1038
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
kind of don't update it for a while

1039
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,320
and you for example deposit into a mixer

1040
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,599
and then withdraw a day later and you

1041
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,719
haven't changed the gas price well

1042
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,399
you've just leaked metadata that allows

1043
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,160
someone to de-anonymize you so there's

1044
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,599
many many many ways that you're leaking

1045
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,359
metadata in using these systems if

1046
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,839
you're not very careful

1047
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,359
i think a while ago there was um there

1048
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,240
was a

1049
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,560
browser extension called make some noise

1050
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,400
this is a couple years ago quite a few

1051
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,720
years ago when we were just being aware

1052
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,400
of how much we're being tracked across

1053
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,480
the website there's a browser extension

1054
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,920
where if you click on click on it or

1055
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,880
just randomly go to a bunch of links

1056
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
which help to deflect attention a little

1057
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,800
bit perhaps to kind of mix i guess mix

1058
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,599
your browser usage i wonder if you know

1059
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,000
that would be that would be

1060
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,079
that would be something that you know

1061
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,560
would kind of serve our purposes i just

1062
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,320
it will be gas heavy for sure but uh

1063
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,160
perhaps on less expensive networks that

1064
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
would be quite valuable

1065
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
uh i don't ever want to assume like a

1066
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,560
ton of prior knowledge but so the idea

1067
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,079
of gas is like i mean just more

1068
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,200
generally known as fees right so in

1069
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,320
bitcoin they're just called fees right

1070
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,520
so basically every transaction that goes

1071
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
to the network has to have a fee payment

1072
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,880
or in the case of ethereum it's called

1073
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
gas different networks have different

1074
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,280
names for this right attached to that

1075
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
transaction to pay the miners who mine

1076
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
the transaction uh and when the network

1077
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,240
is busier and the blocks are more full

1078
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,760
typically you have to like pay a higher

1079
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
fee in the case of bitcoin or pay more

1080
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,040
gas in the case of ethereum

1081
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,599
um so yeah so more expensive computation

1082
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,920
costs more gas and it turns out that

1083
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
cryptography when it's running

1084
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
inside the ethereum virtual machine like

1085
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,920
in a smart contract on a network like

1086
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
ethereum is quite expensive

1087
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,200
and this is one of the downsides to

1088
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,920
doing kind of strong privacy and

1089
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,160
cryptography in a network like ethereum

1090
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,720
um you know like a single transaction

1091
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,079
into

1092
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,000
a mixer like tornado cache last time i

1093
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
checked with something on the order of

1094
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
about 100 to 100 about 100 us dollars in

1095
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
gas

1096
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,640
it varies obviously from day to day but

1097
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,400
that's not cheap but i think linking

1098
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
that to kind of the cryptographers who

1099
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,680
are in this conference people are

1100
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,839
building zero knowledge cryptography

1101
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,079
tools to be able to help do some of this

1102
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,359
computation

1103
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,480
off chain and then settle back to the

1104
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
ethereum layer one so that's that's an

1105
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,320
area where cryptography can really

1106
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
contribute to privacy by helping

1107
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,960
more of these networks get get off the

1108
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
ground

1109
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,400
we're still kind of at the frontier

1110
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,839
of of

1111
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,160
making science happen

1112
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,480
yeah i i like to reflect on the fact

1113
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,040
that even if cryptocurrency fails

1114
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,680
completely and goes away hopefully we as

1115
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,960
a community will still have added some

1116
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,560
value to the world by sort of pushing

1117
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,800
the cryptography space forward and

1118
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,560
especially you know areas like uh like

1119
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
zero knowledge proofs which which

1120
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,680
communities like zcash which michelle is

1121
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,320
a part of um have done a lot for so i

1122
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
think there's some public good here

1123
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,320
uh lest we all hate on cryptocurrency

1124
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,960
too much anyway um so a point that's

1125
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
been touched upon a few times on this

1126
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,599
panel already is this tension between

1127
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,359
usability on the one hand and privacy on

1128
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,520
the other hand um maybe you mentioned

1129
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,280
this a couple times i it's a bit of an

1130
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,880
open-ended question but

1131
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,400
do you have any thoughts on this tension

1132
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
and how

1133
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,640
i guess on the one hand

1134
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,079
the tools we use like wallets which we

1135
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,000
keep coming back to could

1136
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,359
be better designed to make this stuff

1137
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,320
easier on the one hand or in the other

1138
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,760
hand just your personal approach and how

1139
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,560
you

1140
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,680
balance these two because like we can't

1141
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,839
always all have perfect privacy because

1142
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,520
as you said like privacy is is

1143
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,960
frustrating so like what's your kind of

1144
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
personal philosophy maybe do you want to

1145
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
start um yeah in general i think

1146
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,400
obviously it'd be ideal if all these

1147
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
kind of privacy features were baked into

1148
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,520
the operating systems apps everything

1149
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,920
that we use um aside from you know for

1150
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,240
instance like apple is very famous for

1151
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,720
marketing privacy when actually you know

1152
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,200
opening up a backdoor to directly

1153
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,680
channel analytics to their servers

1154
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,599
outside of a vpn if you run it on on mac

1155
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,880
os these days

1156
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,760
um so you know privacy is something that

1157
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,160
you know it seems like a

1158
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,599
checkbox to most people where people

1159
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,359
just want like oh okay yes what i'm

1160
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,200
using is relatively private good enough

1161
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,720
uh move on um so it just is you know

1162
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
anything that um is not commercially

1163
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,320
viable in the sense that you know it's

1164
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
going to address the problems of most

1165
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,160
users the fastest most efficiently

1166
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,280
provide the best experience ultimately

1167
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,680
won't um you know

1168
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,720
won't um you know die in the face of an

1169
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
app that comes by by open source

1170
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,160
community that says okay

1171
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,440
you can use this one instead because

1172
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,560
it's very private even though there's a

1173
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,119
couple quirks and it's harder to use um

1174
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,560
so i think that what we really need to

1175
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,320
think about as a community is to you

1176
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,440
know how do we motivate those who um

1177
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,599
control like the most popular apps um

1178
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,440
both like crypto wallets and normal

1179
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,320
applications etc um to integrate privacy

1180
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,480
by default um you know there are a few

1181
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,800
ways of doing this for instance like

1182
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,720
this whole innovation around zk zero

1183
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,440
knowledge uh proofs um allows for

1184
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,960
opportunities of like monetization of

1185
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,720
data in a way that where you know nobody

1186
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,640
ever actually sees the data but you're

1187
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,839
allowed to draw the insights from it

1188
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,640
which completely um minimize the

1189
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,480
possibility of you know

1190
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,079
data that's been collected about users

1191
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,359
to be leaked

1192
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,520
because you know it's all encrypted

1193
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,599
and remains so for the entire purpose of

1194
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,680
its of its life entire duration of its

1195
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,560
life

1196
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,800
so yeah integrating privacy by default

1197
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,880
um is something that you know doesn't

1198
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,960
make money necessarily um so it's not

1199
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,400
going to be prioritized by development

1200
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,359
teams

1201
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,160
from most mainstream apps and this is uh

1202
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,079
i i actually i can't say i know the

1203
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,440
solution to that but it's something that

1204
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,599
i think we all need to you know consider

1205
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,960
and think about and

1206
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,640
i think that it's possible that there's

1207
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,400
some way that we can motivate you know

1208
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,560
privacy by default being built into you

1209
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,720
know popular applications

1210
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,960
um i so on that note i think the the

1211
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
biggest threat to privacy in these

1212
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,440
applications is consumers biggest

1213
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,400
non-legal threat is consumers not

1214
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,599
demanding for privacy i i know a lot of

1215
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,760
projects who would the products team

1216
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,440
love the idea of talking about privacy

1217
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,119
but the truth is they have 100 things on

1218
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,200
their stack and if their users aren't

1219
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,920
clamoring for these private features

1220
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
then they're not going to build it

1221
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,440
i think i think it's very important

1222
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,000
because on one hand you have

1223
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,839
the authorities pushing down on all

1224
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,000
these projects saying give us your data

1225
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,920
make sure you don't do this or do that

1226
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,760
or encrypt this encrypt that on the

1227
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,599
other hand if consumers don't push back

1228
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,040
then obviously the domino's going to

1229
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,760
fall this way um i think it was for

1230
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,599
example i mean this is this is directly

1231
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,319
tied to the crypto wars in the 90s right

1232
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
because of pushback

1233
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,400
uh we're here today you know we were

1234
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,079
able to make progress i think it was

1235
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,800
biden himself as a senator then who put

1236
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,319
in put in a bill that that said um the

1237
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,240
uh the government must have plain text

1238
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,800
access to to communications and and i

1239
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
think i believe that

1240
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,960
was what motivated uh paul zimmerman to

1241
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,040
kind of work day and night to get his

1242
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,960
pgp out before

1243
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,359
the bill was was enacted

1244
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,440
we stand on the shoulders of giants like

1245
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,560
seriously i think we all need to take a

1246
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,200
moment to to uh express our gratitude

1247
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,720
for the cypherpunks and that movement in

1248
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,319
the 90s and like like michelle said i

1249
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,400
mean we're like quite literally we are

1250
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
here today talking about this because of

1251
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,160
them and their work and and these strong

1252
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,760
privacy tools that they

1253
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,079
uh created like

1254
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,000
we all use these every day in all of us

1255
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,760
i'm sorry we're using the technology to

1256
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,599
swap pictures of monkeys

1257
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,480
um

1258
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,280
where did i want to go

1259
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,000
i think we're at q and a yeah almost

1260
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,760
almost yeah we'll do q a shortly um

1261
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,319
i think you had uh

1262
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,520
one or two

1263
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,880
oh sorry zero knowledge proof we've

1264
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,920
talked about zero knowledge proofs a

1265
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,440
bunch of times um i think it might be

1266
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,880
worth just digressing just for a moment

1267
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,480
to briefly talk about what zero

1268
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,680
knowledge proof is and what its

1269
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,200
application is in privacy and this is

1270
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,720
another topic that we can discuss more

1271
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
during the workshop um

1272
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,640
oh my gosh

1273
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,240
we'll keep it simple photographer friend

1274
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,520
in the audience and pull her out

1275
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,000
yingtong

1276
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,920
i think the short of it is how do you

1277
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,839
prove to somebody that

1278
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
i have the money i say i have without

1279
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,319
disclosing who i am what i have and who

1280
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,240
i want to send it to

1281
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,040
and

1282
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,359
it's a lot of math which i'm not very

1283
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,319
familiar with moon math um and and

1284
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,599
that's that's the power of it um

1285
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,200
i can't really say i think that's yeah i

1286
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,119
think that's accurate right so it allows

1287
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,160
um

1288
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,680
someone to

1289
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,440
assert

1290
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
knowledge of or sort of custody over a

1291
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,040
particular piece of information without

1292
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,520
revealing anything else like no metadata

1293
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,920
whatsoever and so i think the best

1294
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,000
sort of simple example of this is like

1295
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,839
let's say you want to

1296
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,000
you know go to a bar and the bouncer at

1297
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,839
the door asks you to prove that you're

1298
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,760
over age 21

1299
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
in this particular jurisdiction and what

1300
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,200
do we do now we have to hand them you

1301
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,480
know this piece of plastic that has our

1302
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,839
name on it it has our address on it has

1303
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,119
our birthday on it has our photo on it

1304
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,640
like all this metadata

1305
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
it's actually funny i i have a friend

1306
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,920
who uh actually did this she had her id

1307
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,440
and she actually taped over everything

1308
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,640
this is basically a driver's license

1309
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,000
right she taped over everything on it

1310
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,240
except her face and the birthday

1311
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,839
and would and would hand this to people

1312
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,040
at bars and because she didn't want to

1313
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,160
leak metadata and it was such a

1314
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,839
beautiful metaphor for zero knowledge

1315
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,680
proof technically it's not zero

1316
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,599
knowledge because like

1317
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,040
because her birthday's on there and her

1318
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,880
face is on there right so really a zero

1319
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,319
knowledge proof would be a cryptographic

1320
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,880
piece of data that says i am at least 21

1321
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,560
years old and and says nothing else

1322
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,160
whatsoever about the bearer of that

1323
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,400
information and that sounds too good to

1324
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,760
be true but like actually this is a

1325
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,400
technology um that you know emerged in

1326
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,800
the 90s i think and and really has found

1327
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
uh footing in practice in a number of

1328
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,839
crypto

1329
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,280
related applications the past few years

1330
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,800
which is really exciting and we've just

1331
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,400
begun to see i think what this

1332
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,000
technology is capable of it's not the

1333
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,319
only one though there

1334
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,599
people have different views on it but

1335
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,280
trusted execution environments is

1336
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,400
another way

1337
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,000
people um secretly attest to to certain

1338
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,800
transactions it's where data is my

1339
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,880
transaction is encrypted i send it to a

1340
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
secure computing environment

1341
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,400
um and uh the final output is then sent

1342
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,800
out publicly so technically people

1343
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
believe some people believe it's secure

1344
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,319
some people believe you have to trust

1345
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,319
the hardware manufacturer so but that's

1346
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,920
an alternative approach although zero

1347
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
knowledge is the more predominant

1348
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,560
approach today

1349
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,000
i think one thing i wanted to say also

1350
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,200
about using privacy is um

1351
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,720
there is a i think a risk of uh

1352
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,400
i don't know what the right word is but

1353
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,240
maybe tainting yourself it's almost like

1354
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,960
if if somebody sees oh you are using a

1355
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,440
privacy service okay that's suspicious

1356
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,680
i'm a i'm a target you just because of

1357
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,359
that and i think that that's a that's a

1358
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,079
real risk if as a society as a community

1359
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,200
we don't be louder about why we have the

1360
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,240
right to privacy

1361
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,920
yeah that's a super important point

1362
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,240
right privacy only works

1363
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
when it's something that we all adopt

1364
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,599
right so that that the people who need

1365
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,440
the privacy can can hide in the crowd

1366
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,920
figuratively speaking uh and so even if

1367
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,359
just going back to this initial question

1368
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,640
we asked which is why should i care i

1369
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,839
have nothing to hide right this is what

1370
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,760
so many people say when when when you

1371
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,560
ask them you know to care about privacy

1372
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,079
uh even if you have nothing to hide

1373
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,119
today well first of all you may have

1374
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,880
something to hide tomorrow because

1375
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,000
who knew

1376
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,520
a month or two ago that searching for an

1377
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,800
abortion clinic you know could get you

1378
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,119
in trouble in certain places um but but

1379
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,400
even more to the point right there are

1380
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,440
people among us in society who

1381
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,640
need

1382
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,359
us

1383
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,800
to care about privacy because they're

1384
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,400
doing important work so i think that's

1385
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,000
an important point but beyond being an

1386
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,480
altruist i think also there's something

1387
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,680
inherently that feels manipulative about

1388
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,599
the nothing to hide argument it's like

1389
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,680
oh well you know i'm going to put you in

1390
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,960
a spot and accuse you of having

1391
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,560
something to hide but i think we should

1392
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,480
flip the narrative around too the burden

1393
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,200
of proof is on sun is on you

1394
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,280
we should actually ask why why do you

1395
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,560
want to know why are you being such a

1396
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,680
creep

1397
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,119
i think i think that's

1398
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,800
for me that's the that's how i would

1399
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,599
flip the narrative

1400
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,119
anything that helps uh move forward

1401
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,200
privacy by default

1402
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,359
um okay so we'll go to q a just a sec i

1403
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,640
think the last topic i wanted to ask

1404
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,880
about was case studies you began to talk

1405
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,400
a moment ago about mixers and people

1406
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,319
being de-anonymized i think you had one

1407
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,920
or two you wanted to briefly share about

1408
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,880
yeah

1409
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,440
i'll treat them both together

1410
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,359
and at a high level the problem the

1411
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,680
problem space is

1412
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,599
in 2016 two major hacks happened uh one

1413
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,440
the hack of one of the largest exchanges

1414
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,680
then called bitfinex

1415
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,839
the exchange ended up having to haircut

1416
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,400
all their customers by 36 percent

1417
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,000
because of that essentially a lot of

1418
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,920
bitcoin was stolen

1419
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,400
and another one the dao was a

1420
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,520
decentralized vc organizat organization

1421
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,640
that was uh that did an ico in 2016

1422
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,720
and they were hacked as well for for a

1423
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,000
lot of ease a lot of ethereum and

1424
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,520
at that point the stolen ethereum was

1425
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,680
five percent of all east in existence

1426
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,839
and famously led to a fork in ethereum

1427
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,319
um and the ethereum you see today is is

1428
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,119
a v2 because of that fork and

1429
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,079
um

1430
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,119
the first

1431
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,520
two the first the two people behind the

1432
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,839
first hack have been apprehended they

1433
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,400
this was reported in february this year

1434
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,440
so uh five years afterwards

1435
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,720
and then the other one there's a

1436
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,960
suspected uh

1437
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,000
person but nobody has been arrested yet

1438
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and the the few factors that led to um

1439
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,040
their arrest or suspicion

1440
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,359
um have been number one the on-chain

1441
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,800
analysis we've been talking about on

1442
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,960
this panel on chain forensics yeah

1443
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,200
pretty exciting stuff yeah there's a

1444
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,880
central concept called clustering where

1445
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,920
you if you see certain behaviors of how

1446
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,680
bitcoin or theorem are moving around you

1447
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,280
can you can make

1448
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,280
certain deductions

1449
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,720
so that's one

1450
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,040
vector the other vector is behavioral

1451
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,000
analysis we talked about timing if you

1452
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,079
do your transactions you know from nine

1453
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,240
to five new york time you know people

1454
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,440
are going to guess where you live in

1455
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,480
this world

1456
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,640
the other plain plain and simple legal

1457
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,920
subpoenas of exchanges where most of

1458
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,960
them you do have to kyc with

1459
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,040
and subpoenas also have isp providers

1460
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,800
and

1461
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,000
what was the fourth

1462
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,280
forget the fourth but come through the

1463
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,280
workshop

1464
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,599
all right one one final plug so 7 30 p.m

1465
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,960
the fourth floor of the main building

1466
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,400
we'll do a workshop where we'll among

1467
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,440
other things we've talked about will

1468
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,800
also go into these case studies in more

1469
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,760
depth i think we have a couple of other

1470
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,640
case studies too uh all right any final

1471
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,800
words on cryptocurrency privacy best

1472
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,720
practices before we go into q a b

1473
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,680
um yeah it's it's uh you know absolutely

1474
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,599
um you know more than anything i think

1475
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,480
especially for um for for us as you know

1476
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,640
um you know hackers and enthusiasts of

1477
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,400
technology it's just you know

1478
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
um yeah doing doing the work and

1479
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,559
practicing just for fun you know how how

1480
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,240
can you use something extremely

1481
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,319
privately and try and you know

1482
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,440
form a group with your friends and see

1483
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,760
if you can de-anonymize transactions um

1484
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,680
with basic tools that you can learn very

1485
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,800
very quickly

1486
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,680
um

1487
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,040
it's incredible how much data we

1488
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,680
voluntarily offer to you know anybody

1489
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,720
who wants to listen on the internet so

1490
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,680
um yeah minimizing that um just for the

1491
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,480
purposes of you know education and um

1492
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,240
through that education i think a lot of

1493
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,720
people realize like oh wow like this is

1494
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,319
this is something that's worth spending

1495
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,640
some more time on so um yeah that's

1496
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,839
that's what i'd like to to convey

1497
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,800
um i'm not a hacker so i think you're at

1498
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,960
this conference that makes you a hacker

1499
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,240
i'm a side channel hacker um

1500
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,160
i think the the most powerful way some

1501
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,440
of us can contribute is on narrative

1502
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,599
you know go out there talk to people

1503
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,520
talk to the people in charge talk to

1504
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,079
people who create products when you make

1505
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,359
it clear to them that you care about

1506
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,599
privacy and you are not a criminal i

1507
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,599
think that helps change the narrative

1508
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,839
tremendously over over a long enough

1509
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,319
period of time

1510
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:45,920
awesome um

1511
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,480
i guess my final thought would be that

1512
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,359
privacy is something that matters always

1513
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,280
and everywhere which we've mentioned but

1514
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,599
also kind of like has implications up

1515
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,720
and down the software stack um so

1516
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,040
we as developers me as a core developer

1517
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,480
as a protocol developer like you know

1518
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,640
there are things that we can do at the

1519
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,400
layer one of a network

1520
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,440
um to assist with privacy so like for

1521
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,319
example

1522
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,079
uh there's a technique called dandelion

1523
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,200
routing that can be used to kind of

1524
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,040
route transactions through a network in

1525
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,640
such a way that it hides the original

1526
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,760
source of that transaction something

1527
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,839
else we'll talk about uh this evening

1528
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,680
um and then there's again like you know

1529
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,400
there's like the application layer um

1530
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,680
things like wallet software like i think

1531
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,520
a lot as i mentioned earlier about how

1532
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,119
it can be made more user-friendly and

1533
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,119
how we can

1534
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,359
push uh software forward in such a way

1535
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,440
that like we get sort of strong privacy

1536
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,839
or pretty good privacy

1537
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,119
right out of the box

1538
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,880
um but a lot a lot of work remains to be

1539
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,480
done there um

1540
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,400
and you know educate yourself i guess

1541
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,079
that's the final message right because

1542
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,800
all of these tools like that by far by

1543
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,960
far by far the the biggest

1544
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,800
issue that happens uh that results in

1545
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,559
loss of privacy is user error and people

1546
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:55,920
kind of not caring enough for kind of

1547
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
not understanding the tech the

1548
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,760
technologies they're using so um yeah i

1549
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,960
mean we're we're here we're having this

1550
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,400
conversation so that's a good step in

1551
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,880
the right direction uh okay yeah i think

1552
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,839
we have a few minutes left so i think

1553
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:06,960
we'd love to take questions if folks

1554
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,240
have questions thank you so much for

1555
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,240

1558
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,119
how do the questions work there's oh no

1559
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,280
questions we don't have time i saw some

1560
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,680
at the back

1561
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,599
no no time yeah because we're supposed

1562
