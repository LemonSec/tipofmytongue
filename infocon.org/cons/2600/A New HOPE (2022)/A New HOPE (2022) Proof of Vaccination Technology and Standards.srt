1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
and now to our next speaker

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,120
once mass immunization campaigns begin

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,759
whether it was smallpox in 1947 polio in

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,639
1955 or coveted more recently

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
governments and people want means to

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
verify vaccination status our next

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,920
speaker will discuss modern proof of

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
vaccination credentials how the document

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
and issuers protect the underlying

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,039
information

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,480
and how governments and industry work

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,680
together to create an

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,840
inter-jurisdictionally

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,320
interoperable document please welcome dr

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,680
greg newby

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,680
[Applause]

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,960
thanks jen thanks for everyone showing

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,239
up i don't know if you've seen me before

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,520
at the conference but this is actually

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,960
i'm actually doing a talk believe it or

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
not blind refereeing

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,399
no nepotism nothing like that so uh

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,160
proof of vaccination technologies and

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
standards so um let me just start out by

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,559
saying i'm not officially representing

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,320
someone i'm going to do my best not to

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,399
mention my employer in canada not

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,960
representing them not representing any

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
provincial or territory government

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,559
federal government anything like that

31
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,719
and i'm not telling you any secrets i

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,119
was not exposed to any secrets um we

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,920
have a little bit of a um

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,680
not a non-disclosure but a little bit of

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,720
a

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,040
terms and use or a use agreement not

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000
violating any of that stuff um

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
at the same time this is stuff i'm going

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,479
to talk about is um is kind of opaque i

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
found even learning a lot about it as

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
i've been working with this so i thought

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,320
it would be a good a good topic to share

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,799
here at the hackers on planet earth

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
for the record

45
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
i pasted the abstract you don't need to

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
spend too much time on that and we got a

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,159
nice summary that went beyond the

48
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,240
abstract and this is a little bit about

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,040
me

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
people know i think here at this time

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
that i'm involved with the hackers on

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
planet earth conference

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
done some writing for 2600 magazine this

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
is all from my point of view sort of a

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
hobby and interest

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
but as do many of us i have a pretty

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
strong i.t background

58
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,399
do some work in

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,520
infosec and and i'm also into ebooks

60
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,960
which i've talked about

61
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,399
in the on the hope stage a couple of

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
times so you can refer to those previous

63
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,680
talks if you want to know about some of

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,800
my

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,878
other distractions but today it's

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
actually as i said it's a story about

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
something that i was involved with in my

68
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
workplace

69
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,879
and

70
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,440
more or less i was a technical lead for

71
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,640
one of the 13 provinces or territories

72
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,959
of canada the you know country to our

73
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
north and um what we did was something

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
that worked across canada in a very

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,239
standardized way which i think is

76
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
interesting and even though the u.s has

77
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,120
nothing like the same scope or scale of

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,680
standardization the same standards are

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
used in canada so i'll mention again

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
probably but the excel sherpas uses the

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
exact same technology the new york excel

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,319
surpass uses the exact same technology

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,760
that i'm going to talk about so it's

84
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
relevant to uh to the us as well uh the

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
rest of the world most of the rest of

86
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
the world is using a somewhat different

87
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,920
standards there's maybe two or three

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
other ones but it's the same concept and

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
i'll go into that in a little more

90
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
detail

91
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
so the um the idea here i'm gonna make

92
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
this just a little bigger excuse me

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,799
give me a sec

94
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
i just need to make my my view my

95
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,720
presenter view a little bigger so the

96
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,040
idea here is we want to issue a um

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
credential so we didn't call for some

98
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
reason they didn't call it a uh

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
certificate they called it a credential

100
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,120
so a proof of vaccination credential or

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
pvc is what we called in canada and so

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,239
we wanted something that as uh jen

103
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,480
mentioned would let people

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,280
demonstrate that they are vaccinated it

105
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,519
would be privacy preserving and

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
minimally disclosing of information so

107
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
for example

108
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,319
you might

109
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,319
consider rightly your proof of

110
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,080
vaccination or your vaccination status

111
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
to be part of your health record well we

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,519
don't want someone to hold up a piece of

113
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,080
paper with your proof of vaccination and

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
have your whole health record on it we

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
want it to just do what it needs to do

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
which is demonstrate the vaccine proof

117
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,920
but it did need to be something that

118
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,560
would work across uh jurisdictions we

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,760
wanted something that would be what you

120
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
call self-sovereign which is like your

121
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
driver's license in your wallet which

122
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,560
means that you only show it to people

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
when you want to

124
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,120
it doesn't require a remote database um

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,040
uh it's not something that needs to be

126
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
uh

127
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,959
um

128
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
protected beyond what the information is

129
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,440
that that that is on it we also want to

130
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
make it uh reasonably fraud proof and

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
tamper evident so in other words can you

132
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
fake one can you make one that that

133
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
looks the same but you made it yourself

134
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
and have that pass the validation checks

135
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,680
the answer is is uh qualified no and uh

136
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
will it be evident if you take a valid

137
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
one and make a change say to put your

138
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,880
name in or instead of someone else's

139
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
name and again the answer is a qualified

140
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
no

141
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
qualified because if you're reading it

142
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,840
digitally then the answer is no you

143
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,440
can't fake these things very easily

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
because they're digitally signed and

145
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
that gives you a lot of tamper evidence

146
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,160
and validation that we'll talk about a

147
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,199
little bit

148
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
but if you're just reading the thing

149
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
reading the words on it as opposed to

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,039
using a technical solution then yeah you

151
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
could you know photoshop and change the

152
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
um

153
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
change the name easily enough so on the

154
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
digital side tamper evidence and

155
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
anti-fraud were very important we wanted

156
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,639
to be able to validate these things with

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,479
with apps you know with phone apps for a

158
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,840
variety of reasons you know getting on

159
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,360
planes getting into venues getting into

160
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,160
supermarkets whatever the jurisdictional

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,240
uh requirement was and same sort of

162
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
thing happened in the u.s when they used

163
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,160
these uh these same technologies we

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
wanted to leverage um an emerging de

165
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
facto standard by de facto i mean it's

166
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
not an actual standard like an iso

167
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
standard or one of the other standard

168
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,080
bodies sanders w3c what have you

169
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
but it's a de facto standard in that a

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
lot of places are using it and therefore

171
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
it becomes a standard um in practice oh

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
and by the way there's no blockchain

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
involved the the couple of times i

174
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
talked to people about this the

175
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
anti-fraud anti-tamper evidence that

176
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
said oh you need a you need a a ledger

177
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,520
right you need to be able to have an

178
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,919
immutable ledger and that

179
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,639
is not a completely incorrect statement

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
but it's a mostly incorrect statement

181
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,000
because one of the goals with a

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
self-sovereign certificate and the app

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
is that these should not need to call

184
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
home they should not need to verify

185
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
externally because if you do that then

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
you know what if you're in a place with

187
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
no mobile network you know or in a place

188
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
where the internet's down or something

189
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,720
like that

190
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,759
and

191
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,600
that's a practical thing but and we

192
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,440
don't want to have a central database of

193
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,039
this stuff you want to have a document

194
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,199
that someone can show in the case of

195
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,319
canada that someone can get their

196
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
document issued in new brunswick one of

197
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
the provinces and they can show it in

198
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,080
northwest territories one of the

199
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,319
territories and it's it's fully

200
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,319
interoperable without northwest needing

201
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,840
to know where the new brunswick database

202
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
is so everything's self-contained so

203
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
yeah no no blockchain despite you know

204
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
maybe having a little bit of a

205
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,599
conceptual appeal

206
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,479
the practical issues with uh an

207
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,720
immutable stored ledger just don't match

208
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
up with the requirements of this

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
application

210
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
so we've lived through covet 19 we're

211
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
still living through cover 19. i just

212
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,400
picked four

213
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
you know sort of sort of milestones but

214
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
just give you an idea of how quickly

215
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,520
some of this has occurred even though of

216
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,199
course it feels like it's moving very

217
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,720
slowly feels like it's forever but um

218
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,280
march of uh 2020 was when the world

219
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
health organization declared covet 19 to

220
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,160
be a global pandemic that was a pretty

221
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
big deal it appeared a few months

222
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
earlier in in china of course as

223
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
everyone knows

224
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
first arrived in the united states i

225
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,960
think it was february i'm not sure it

226
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
might have been january of 2020 and then

227
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
it was declared a pandemic in march

228
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,160
by april vaccine programs were announced

229
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
so this was interesting and i remember

230
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
someone not a i'm not a medical doctor

231
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,440
but i remember as someone with a

232
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,599
scientific background thinking okay

233
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,240
there are almost no effective facts

234
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
vaccines against viruses

235
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,960
very few

236
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,240
and most of those are a live vaccine and

237
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,800
they were talking about mrna vaccines so

238
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,919
it's like oh this is pretty cool so

239
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,360
maybe they'll come up with it maybe they

240
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
won't of course now we know that they

241
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
did but this was announced in uh april

242
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
of of 2020 and then by december of 2020

243
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
which again that's in retrospect that

244
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
seems insanely fast but if you remember

245
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,879
what we were doing in 2020 it was

246
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
miserable right it was like you know

247
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
masking and double masking and all these

248
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,039
songs about how to wash your hands for

249
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,240
25 seconds and and six foot distancing

250
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
and not knowing remember this we didn't

251
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,039
know at the start of this period whether

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,240
it was

253
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
aerosol transmission whether it was

254
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
waterborne transmission we had a lot of

255
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,919
questions about this

256
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,200
you know if it took residents in your

257
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
lungs so you know by the end of that

258
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
year just a year because of the effort

259
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,120
involved across the country across the

260
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,880
world i mean um

261
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,240
uh we had some uh uh vaccinations that

262
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
were that were you know through with cl

263
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
with the early clinical trials it got

264
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,959
the emergency use authorization from fda

265
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
in the u.s and then that happened in

266
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,880
other countries including canada um and

267
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,279
vaccines started going out by very late

268
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,839
december and then into early january and

269
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
that was again both the us and canada

270
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
were pretty close in lockstep

271
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
um and then it was april 2021 so a few

272
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
months later when you started to see and

273
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,040
it might have been plus or minus in

274
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
april but uh you started seeing proof of

275
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
vaccination requirements so if people

276
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,640
need to prove that they're vaccinated in

277
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
order to get on a cruise ship get on a

278
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,040
plane go into a supermarket retain their

279
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
job which often happened

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
these other types of purposes then you

281
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
needed a proof right you got vaccinated

282
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,600
you needed a proof

283
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
so some of the reasons why you might

284
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
want it some of the opportunities here

285
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
citizens of course want to be vaccinated

286
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,120
some people are hesitant to be

287
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
vaccinated but if you're vaccinated

288
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
you'd like to be able to prove that

289
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,560
and also if you're

290
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,440
hesitant about other getting vaccinated

291
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
and or for whatever reason good reasons

292
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
you don't want to be among people that

293
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
might be sick you might want to know

294
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
that other people can prove that they're

295
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
vaccinated so you have confidence just

296
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,839
like we did in this venue you have

297
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,839
confidence that the people in the venue

298
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,079
have been have been vaccinated

299
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,839
businesses we just said might might

300
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,959
demand to verify vaccination governments

301
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,279
might require vaccination in various uh

302
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
settings and and health professionals

303
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
want to see more vaccination but if

304
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
you're going to require vaccination then

305
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
you want to also be able to protect

306
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
against fraud if it's trivially easy to

307
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,399
have a fraudulent proof of vaccination

308
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
then you're not getting what you'd like

309
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
out of the vaccination program so a lot

310
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
of reasons to have a you know one of

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
these sort of robust proof of

312
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,079
vaccination credentials so um so what we

313
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,680
did is um

314
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,519
and this is across the board not just in

315
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
canada and the us with this particular

316
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,120
standard i'm talking about but with all

317
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
the implementation uh sort of similarly

318
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
for the proof of acts that you get

319
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,200
around the country and around the world

320
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
is you don't want to store a lot of

321
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
information because people are

322
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,279
sophisticated enough

323
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,519
in the health profession especially

324
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,920
about over over sharing information they

325
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
don't want to disclose more than they

326
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
need to so what that means if you is if

327
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
you're going to prove vaccination what

328
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
do you really need one is you need to

329
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
know what the vaccines were because

330
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,079
there's different policies in different

331
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,360
places

332
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,959
for example sometimes there's a new

333
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,800
there not as often now but there used to

334
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
be new vaccines that got approved in one

335
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,040
place and it took time for it to be

336
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,240
approved in the other place so there

337
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
might be a period where your proof of

338
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,399
vaccination has you showing up as fully

339
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,920
immunized meeting the immunization

340
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,000
requirements in one place but not in

341
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
another place right so you have to know

342
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,839
about the vaccinations you also have to

343
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,640
know

344
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
um

345
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,560
the identity right so if i if i provide

346
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
my proof of vaccination and it has my

347
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
name on it has you know the the vaccines

348
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,000
on it that's great but does this pertain

349
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
to me or is it you know

350
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,480
someone else's proof of vaccinations you

351
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
also need identification and that's

352
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
usually provided separately again just

353
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
like we did here at hope you show your

354
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
proof of vaccination whatever form that

355
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,720
may take and then you provide your proof

356
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
of identity and the job is to make sure

357
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,000
that the identity matches the

358
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,839
vaccination and that the vaccination

359
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
meets whatever the requirements are for

360
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,360
that particular venue

361
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,639
and we want to be standardized for the

362
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,920
reasons i mentioned before you want to

363
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,440
be able to take a proof of vaccination

364
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
from one place read it in another place

365
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
and as you can imagine a pretty good way

366
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,079
of doing that is with automation and

367
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:12,959
that's really what we're going to be

368
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
talking about today um and again i

369
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
mentioned self-sovereign the idea that

370
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,360
that individuals determine when to

371
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,920
present this individuals might oh i have

372
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
mine here i'll show it again in a little

373
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
more detail but individuals might you

374
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
know fold spindle mutilate and just show

375
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,959
you the qr code and not show you the

376
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,720
birth date right because you don't need

377
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,000
to know the birth date especially if

378
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,279
you're scanning it so there's a little

379
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,000
bit of control even over the physical

380
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,920
side so let's get into what this thing

381
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,839
looked like so i just showed showed you

382
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,680
mine uh briefly and we'll we'll dig into

383
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
it on the slideshow so you can see a

384
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
little bit better i'm going to be

385
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
showing dominantly examples from canada

386
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,519
mostly because well

387
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,800
mostly probably because those are the

388
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
ones i'm most familiar with but also

389
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
because um the canada came up with a

390
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,480
standard for the whole country in the

391
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,079
u.s there's a we'll talk about this a

392
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
little more there's a real mixture of

393
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
how they're presented the look and feel

394
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,120
but

395
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,639
if they're machine readable they'd use

396
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,600
the exact same qr code specification

397
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
this uh de facto specification that i

398
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
talked about so the um the qr code part

399
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
and the associated payload you know the

400
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
standard for the payload in the qr code

401
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,040
the content are exactly the same in the

402
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
us and canada so this is just one of the

403
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,120
examples that are from

404
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,519
you know from the the canadian websites

405
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,160
and what i'll do this is uh the front

406
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,200
and back page uh generally in canada the

407
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,160
uh front page is the standard the back

408
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
page is whatever that particular

409
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,240
jurisdiction wanted to add for uh for

410
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
their purposes so for example

411
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,320
they might say here's where to go to get

412
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,680
more information and that's going to be

413
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,839
different depending on the issuer in the

414
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
united states there are some states

415
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,079
including new york that

416
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,320
centralize you know they have a

417
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,880
reasonably centralized health database

418
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,600
uh there are a lot of places in the u.s

419
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
where there's no centralization so so

420
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
these are issued by you know

421
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
walmart for example gave tons and tons

422
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
of vaccinations but in canada they're

423
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,440
pretty standardized and the second page

424
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,199
was for the local information i'm

425
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
zooming in and actually changed from one

426
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
i think from the yukon and here's one

427
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
from ontario and um

428
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
uh what you can see here is up top it's

429
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,320
the issuer right this is this is sort of

430
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,800
an arbitrary standard but in a in a

431
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,399
whole country it's nice to have a common

432
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,079
look and feel i think it would have been

433
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,079
nice for the u.s to do that but there's

434
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,959
just so much resistance on the political

435
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,639
side for willingness to do that so

436
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,839
there's a

437
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
buy-in to the technical part of the qr

438
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
code but not at all to look and feel

439
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
well a little bit we'll talk about that

440
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,399
momentarily but not for the digital pvc

441
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
um so anyway you see up top the issuing

442
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
jurisdiction in this case country canada

443
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,399
province or territory of ontario and

444
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
then you can look a little further and

445
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,839
you see that there's a little personal

446
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,079
identifying information and all it is is

447
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
name and date name name and birth date

448
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,160
right so you're not providing stuff that

449
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,720
isn't necessary to to verify identity

450
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
you're not doing i don't know address or

451
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,160
citizenship or

452
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,600
the candidates call the social insurance

453
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,639
number u.s um

454
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,320
social security number you know you

455
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,720
don't need that stuff to verify so it's

456
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
privacy protecting or or minimally

457
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
disclosing of personal information we'll

458
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,839
talk a lot about the qr code

459
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,720
this is

460
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
the machine readable

461
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,360
payload you know the content of the pvc

462
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,240
and then

463
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,399
also the human readable version because

464
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
the idea here is if it's only machine

465
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
readable then you go to a place and they

466
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,000
just drop their you know you're going

467
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
into a bar or venue and they just drop

468
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
their phone and they can't verify

469
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
digitally

470
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,720
using the app well you want them to be

471
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,480
able to read visually

472
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
what's going on and as i said earlier

473
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,320
visually is great the same information

474
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,839
is there almost the exact same

475
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,160
information as is in the qr payload uh

476
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
slightly less but almost the exact same

477
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,000
but um but it doesn't have any

478
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
anti-fraud capabilities right in other

479
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,600
words you could you could have

480
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,279
photoshopped or whatever a document that

481
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
looks just like this and

482
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,040
for someone reading it verbally visually

483
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,639
they wouldn't be able to know that it

484
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,320
was faked you need the digital piece to

485
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
do that

486
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
all right so um and these are a couple

487
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
of urls i'll post these slides on my

488
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,839
website

489
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,240
which i have at the end of the talk and

490
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,839
if you want them you can email me i'm

491
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,600
happy to share them

492
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,519
but these are a couple of places where

493
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
you can find sample repositories canada

494
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,519
has a nice repository

495
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,320
the u.s they have a

496
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
cdc page that talks about a couple of

497
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,920
the different standards and also if you

498
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,279
look a little further you know new york

499
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
state has their own page which i think

500
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,600
is this right here and maryland and a

501
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,040
couple other states do a pretty good job

502
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
of these

503
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
pages so in new york state the

504
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
equivalent of what i'm showing you the

505
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
uh proof of vaccination credential that

506
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
canada came up with is the um

507
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,000
the excelsior pass where a individual

508
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
i don't know if someone in new york

509
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,959
probably knows for sure i don't know

510
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,559
that they were issuing like a

511
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,880
paper version of this or not uh or if

512
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,799
this is printable but i know that it's

513
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
it's basically an app and you're getting

514
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,359
your uh your qr code and the payload

515
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,119
from the new york state department of

516
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,160
health so they have a you know

517
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
centralized database so if you get a

518
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
vaccination and cvs in new york then

519
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,679
then that can be fed up to new york

520
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,760
state get your uh

521
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
get it into the app and then you're able

522
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
to show this qr code just like on my

523
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,039
piece of paper

524
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,600
here to someone that wants to verify

525
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,120
your

526
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,440
uh your status so very very similar but

527
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
you know obviously a somewhat different

528
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,559
look and feel and some different details

529
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,039
um and here's some other uh

530
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,760
examples this is from walmart so uh you

531
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,679
know biggest retailer in the u.s has a

532
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,880
lot of pharmacies gave a lot of

533
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,320
vaccinations millions and millions of

534
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,760
vaccinations exact same qr code right

535
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,600
and again different look and feel but

536
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
the payload is the same the qr code

537
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,880
payload is the same uh and the advantage

538
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,520
over the you know printed card a lot of

539
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
a lot of us got a printed card when we

540
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
got the vaccination

541
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
and then needed to get the digital one

542
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,160
you know go online somehow and get the

543
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,559
digital one and download it or print it

544
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,360
um

545
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
the non non-digital card the printed

546
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,919
version is standardized which is nice so

547
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
easy to see what's there but extremely

548
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,640
easy to uh to fake right i mean all you

549
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,200
have to do is is get someone else's card

550
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,039
make a copy do a little

551
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,080
digital editing and you can have

552
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,280
something that looks just the same and

553
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,039
says that you're vaccinated

554
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
but it's uh fake right it's a

555
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,799
forgery

556
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,160
um

557
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,600
as i just mentioned in the u.s there's a

558
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,799
whole lot of variety in how this is done

559
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,760
um

560
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
i'll show you the list maybe i'll spin

561
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
out in a moment i think i'll spin out to

562
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,679
a web browser and i'll show you just a

563
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,120
little bit of the list of those that are

564
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,480
using the same

565
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,200
standard so it's i believe at 17 did i

566
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
say it might have said 13. it's

567
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,559
something like that i think it's 17

568
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,960
states adopted this we've mentioned new

569
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,000
york because we're here in new york

570
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
and that sounds like not that many right

571
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,280
i mean it's not it's fewer than half of

572
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,760
the united states however

573
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,120
hundreds of health care providers hmos

574
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
pharmacies uh these these types of

575
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,080
places

576
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
adopted the standard which means that

577
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
because the state is not usually the one

578
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,360
that's immunizing you right you don't go

579
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
to like a new york state clinic or

580
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
something that immunized you go to cvs

581
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
or something like that um that actually

582
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
the coverage for this standard you know

583
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,679
the

584
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
qr code standard is actually quite great

585
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
i haven't seen any kind of statistics

586
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,120
but certainly there's a pretty good

587
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,559
chance that if you were vaccinated in

588
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,280
the u.s you can get a digital

589
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
and either an app or a paper or

590
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,799
something that looks more or less like

591
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,679
what i'm talking about

592
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,600
okay so

593
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,080
let's talk about actually let's spin out

594
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
to the web browser just for a moment i'm

595
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
going to do this a few times hopefully

596
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,799
it'll work okay this is what i just

597
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,720
mentioned this is the oh wait a minute

598
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
so i have to go back here

599
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
i have to press escape now i have to go

600
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,039
out to the web browser so this is the

601
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
the list from the smart health

602
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,960
smart health dot cards is url

603
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
but um

604
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,960
uh in canada there's all the provinces

605
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
and territories and then there's uh like

606
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,200
the armed services and stuff like that

607
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
and then the u.s there's 17 or so states

608
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
which doesn't sound like a lot but then

609
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,080
you keep and there's a couple of other

610
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
countries that are using this and then

611
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,919
you keep scrolling and say okay here's

612
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,480
pharmacies and as we said you know

613
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
walmart cvs walgreens

614
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,039
are dominant in the u.s and so you're

615
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
talking about millions and millions of

616
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
doses of vaccinations

617
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,280
and you keep going and you get all these

618
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,679
other dozens and dozens uh scores and

619
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
scores of different organizations of

620
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
different types

621
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
right so it really is the dominant

622
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,760
standard in um in the u.s and canada

623
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,280
even though it's much more centralized

624
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,840
in the uh in canada than it is in the us

625
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,120
and that link is in the uh

626
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,880
in the in the deck

627
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,760
oops what i just do is a

628
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,400
slide sorter oh and we're back so let's

629
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,320
talk about the qr code in a little bit

630
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
more detail

631
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
and um these are just some of the

632
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,919
various points um but but more or less

633
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,559
it's it's um the basics as we said

634
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,640
privacy preserving by not including

635
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,919
information that doesn't need to be

636
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,400
included this is pretty reasonable any

637
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
reasonable uh organization that was

638
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,080
working on a health card standard to

639
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,919
disclose information would make the

640
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,840
exact same decision you know

641
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840
whatever you can say about uh health

642
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,480
problems and insurance issues and hmos

643
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
and all these folks when you're sitting

644
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,000
around the table with the policy people

645
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,520
and the technical people i was the

646
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,960
technical person but you're sitting

647
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
around the table with the health policy

648
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,919
people and the

649
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,520
technology people

650
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,840
always the conversation is about privacy

651
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,320
always you know it's like how can we

652
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,840
make sure that whatever we're doing with

653
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
our technology is not inappropriately

654
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
disclosing information that uh you know

655
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,799
that's personal health information so

656
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,960
what's in the the content the payload as

657
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
i said is um

658
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
uh just a little bit of information

659
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
about the individual name date of birth

660
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,159
some information about the vaccination

661
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,039
given

662
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,320
which is more or less what we call the

663
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,760
trade name or the brand name you know

664
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
the name like uh moderna spike fax these

665
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
types of things uh the dose where it was

666
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,400
administered the lot number and um

667
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,280
uh

668
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,640
and also a little bit of information

669
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
about validity there's a situation where

670
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,880
uh interesting thing i learned situation

671
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,280
where you can get a uh a vaccination and

672
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,520
then it turned out it was invalid which

673
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
is kind of weird things why'd you get

674
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,480
that shot well it might have been that

675
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,799
the lot was bad for example the you know

676
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,799
the lot that the vaccine came in was

677
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,200
found out later to be that so um so they

678
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,640
have a thing about validity and um

679
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,840
and then this stuff will spend a little

680
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
more time on uh digital signature by the

681
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,679
issuer so this is public key

682
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,080
cryptography um and um

683
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
uh and then on the implementation side

684
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,679
as i mentioned before it doesn't contain

685
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,280
things like social security number your

686
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
insurance card number or or things like

687
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,880
that it does include it does include

688
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
where you got the vaccination at least

689
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,480
at the jurisdiction level i think

690
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,440
probably

691
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
uh in canada it's going to say something

692
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,159
like um ontario in uh the us is going to

693
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,600
say something like cbs you know it's

694
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,679
like where you got this thing and then

695
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,120
um

696
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
another characteristics as i said is

697
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,799
there's well in new york state i guess

698
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,640
there is but in canada

699
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
the uh the health care provider is a

700
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,960
province or territory and so there is a

701
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,080
central database for say ontario or for

702
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,039
say quebec in the u.s

703
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,039
usually these are distributed so walmart

704
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,600
has a database cvs has a database um in

705
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,279
the case of new york as i said before it

706
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,120
seems like records do flow up and other

707
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,799
people might know more d i mean sure i'm

708
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,880
sure more people more no more details

709
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
including in the audience here

710
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,799
but

711
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,159
that flows up to the new york state

712
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,440
health department

713
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,559
so that they're the ones that are

714
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,880
issuing the excel sure pass

715
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,559
but no database lookups and also and

716
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,559
this is important is that you don't need

717
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,520
to call home to to verify

718
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,039
the document we'll talk about that in a

719
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,640
little bit more

720
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,039
and here's just a url that has the a

721
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,480
little bit of the detail uh the

722
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
technical detail the specification when

723
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,559
you look at the the

724
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,880
decoded information from the qr code

725
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
which we'll do together momentarily you

726
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,000
see that it's an shc colon slash data

727
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
type as opposed like http or something

728
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,279
like that so this is the you know

729
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
protocol or the data type definition

730
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,000
smart health card standard and then

731
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
that's a particular encoding that tells

732
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
your you know whatever you're looking at

733
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,559
it with the browser how to decode what's

734
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,080
there

735
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,640
the um

736
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,840
specific format of the payload is a jws

737
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,480
compact serialization json web signature

738
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,679
jws

739
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
and the decoded payload is signed and

740
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
we'll talk about that in a little bit

741
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,480
more detail but it's signed with a

742
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,200
sha-256 hash of a

743
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,840
elliptic curve key so pretty strong

744
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,760
crypto not the strongest but but uh but

745
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,840
pretty strong crypto in the uh public

746
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,799
key

747
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,880
sense uh and what this does because it's

748
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,279
sha plus ec what you're doing is you're

749
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,440
able to you're making a thing they would

750
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
call it a hash or digest so what you're

751
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,279
doing is actually two things

752
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,000
one is that you're able to verify that

753
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,480
it's not been tampered with so when you

754
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
have the the hash the sha 256 uh you

755
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,640
know the one way hash if someone changes

756
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,720
even one bit

757
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,360
in the digital payload then the hash

758
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,720
won't match

759
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
what's in the payload right so tamper

760
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,039
evident or tamper resistant

761
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,440
and then with the digital signature what

762
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,000
that means is you can use the public key

763
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
signature

764
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,400
um

765
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,039
i'm sorry you can use the uh the url

766
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,559
that goes to the public key signature

767
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,679
and you can verify that the issuer as

768
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,960
long as you're trusted it hasn't been

769
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,200
tampered with that the issuer out there

770
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,600
on the internet the uh the key matches

771
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,400
what the payload is so that is um

772
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,559
a validating factor so that's kind of

773
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,720
interesting to me because it's um

774
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,440
it's both the the ability to uh and

775
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,520
that's sort of typical of pki right with

776
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,400
a verified email whatever it is is that

777
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,559
your tamper evident and you're also able

778
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,279
to validate the issuer the same with the

779
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,960
same technology

780
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,799
so we'll do a quick little

781
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,440
show and tell with this

782
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,279
we're we're gonna look at the portal

783
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,679
let's i think maybe first thing no i'll

784
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,039
just i'll just i'm sorry i'll just zoom

785
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,039
out to the uh to the web page

786
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
to the uh web browser again let's do

787
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,320
that

788
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,080
so

789
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
this is a web page anyone can go to it's

790
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,880
a

791
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
verifier portal for the

792
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,120
shc i think it can maybe do a few things

793
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
other than that and so what i think i'll

794
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,440
try i'm just going to try this but but

795
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,279
i'm you know i've done presentations

796
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,360
before so i also have the output stored

797
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,159
in another web window but so this as i

798
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,760
showed before this is my personal proof

799
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,919
of vaccination credential why am i

800
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,679
showing it to you because

801
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,360
there's very little in here that's not

802
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,720
readily available you already know my

803
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
name you don't know my date of birth but

804
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,919
it's not that hard to find my date of

805
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,679
birth and then everything else is what

806
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,679
vaccines i got and i'm not really very

807
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
sensitive to people knowing that i'm

808
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,799
happy for you to know what vaccines i

809
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,960
got and boosters

810
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,520
vaccines boosters um

811
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
so the qr code is over here so what

812
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,320
we're going to do here we'll try this

813
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,840
is we're going to say scan the code

814
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,640
and we'll try this it might not work

815
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,039
because of the lighting

816
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,840
not too happy i didn't think it would be

817
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
that's why i i did this before oh there

818
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,720
it goes okay excellent so yeah yeah yeah

819
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,760
i take no credit so um yeah like i said

820
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,240
i i i had stored a copy just in case i i

821
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
wasn't able to scan it but um

822
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,200
so this is uh uh it shows it in a couple

823
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
different ways

824
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
um and it's more or less the same thing

825
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,760
just presented in a few different ways

826
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,919
so this is the raw data here and you can

827
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,559
see shc colon slash right

828
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,679
um and then the uh the jws encoded which

829
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,720
is

830
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,159
i don't know exactly how it's different

831
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,000
than base64 but it's that's the same

832
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,559
type of thing

833
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,039
and then they decode numerically which

834
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,840
we're not going to dwell on they decode

835
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,559
the compact jws but it's compact so it's

836
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,640
not well presented and then they just do

837
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,919
a nice little

838
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,600
unrolling down here which we'll we'll

839
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,640
look at together um one thing here part

840
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,240
of the payload is a public key url um so

841
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,399
this is uh a lot of you have seen this

842
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,919
if you're in the technology world it's a

843
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,480
pretty common approach for uh validating

844
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,080
that the uh

845
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,399
the issuer is legit so you have a um

846
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,679
sort of a standard sort of standard

847
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,960
of saying it's a domain slash well known

848
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,440
uh slash something you know it's a json

849
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,039
file so all you're doing is going on the

850
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,399
public web to a a with https to a site

851
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,640
and what this is is a public key right

852
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,240
with a little bit of extra stuff i don't

853
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,679
i don't think i i might have i might

854
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,880
have a slide that shows a little bit of

855
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,919
that i'm not going to dwell on that too

856
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,000
much it's just a json that has a public

857
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,039
key and a little bit of additional

858
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
information so that's part of the

859
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,559
payload and you uh scroll down

860
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,399
and yeah actually i'm sorry this is

861
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,760
actually what i just talked about this

862
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,200
is the the public key itself

863
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
plus as i said there a little bit of

864
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,399
additional information about it the uh

865
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,720
the format and whatnot the standard that

866
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,200
they're using

867
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
and then uh keep going verify signature

868
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
true right so again you could test this

869
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,279
you could change a bit

870
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,039
make a new qr code it's pretty easy to

871
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,960
generate a qr code a lot of software

872
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,080
that can do that and then you can

873
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,919
demonstrate that it says false right

874
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,360
which is what you want to happen if you

875
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
if you tamper with it and then here it's

876
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,039
sort of long because they unpacked it

877
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,919
before it was a compact presentation

878
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,000
here they've nicely formatted it and so

879
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,159
you can see that this is just the um

880
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
more or less just what's on the pvc

881
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
document itself

882
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,679
except that it has a little bit more

883
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,600
detail about the vaccination i can't

884
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
remember exactly what it is right now

885
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
actually but there's a um

886
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
a tiny bit more information i think what

887
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
has the validity which is not part of

888
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
the printout but it's more or less the

889
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,159
same as the um

890
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,840
uh

891
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
the human readable payload except that

892
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,440
it has this cool

893
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,159
public key

894
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,120
ability to do the the anti-fraud

895
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,039
anti-tampering

896
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,440
okay so that was a nice little demo very

897
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,960
good and

898
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
we'll talk about the standard a little

899
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
bit in other words what you saw just now

900
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,919
and then we'll also talk about the apps

901
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,279
to verify uh these things so um

902
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,279
so as we said the json payload the qr

903
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,760
code has all the printed information a

904
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,600
little more i've said that already

905
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
the embedded public key signature said

906
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,240
that already we showed you the

907
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,799
where the public key is and so that the

908
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,000
document doesn't need to store the

909
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,679
public key or shouldn't store the public

910
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,600
key why because if you put the public

911
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,640
key in the document then in order to

912
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,679
commit fraud all you have to do is put

913
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,840
your own public key in the document

914
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,120
right so that it doesn't work to have

915
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,039
the public key be part of the document

916
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,720
itself it has to be remote and we'll

917
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
talk about how the apps handle that in a

918
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,200
fascinating way momentarily

919
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,600
yeah and it's standard the the uh smart

920
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,679
health card is is a as i said before a

921
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,919
de facto standard uh this we actually

922
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,600
already talked about and i showed you

923
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,360
the um the different places that have

924
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,799
adopted it

925
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,399
uh just a couple of other countries as i

926
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,720
said europe is doing the exact same

927
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,080
thing but they chose a somewhat

928
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,600
different standard just like for

929
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
electricity and some other stuff

930
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,519
let's talk about apps so

931
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,399
in

932
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,200
new york you have the excelsior app

933
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,240
which is where your pvc lives your proof

934
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,159
of vaccination credential lives right as

935
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,519
i said i don't know if you got a paper

936
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,600
one like that or not actually but the

937
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,760
app itself has a qr code and it has a

938
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,039
little bit of additional information

939
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,039
very similar to what i'm showing you on

940
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,519
paper um and by the way this paper you

941
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,519
can also get as a pdf it's not like it's

942
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,039
not like it's not like you only get a

943
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,000
piece of paper you know you get a

944
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,279
digital thing and you can print it um

945
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,279
so in new york though if you want to if

946
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,880
you're say a business and you want to

947
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
validate a bunch of people's pvcs

948
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,399
because they're coming into your store

949
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,519
they're coming into your bar they're

950
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,200
getting on your plane something like

951
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
that you need an app to read these

952
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,720
things so that's we're not

953
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,600
we're not going to talk about the

954
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,000
excelsior app for displaying or you know

955
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,840
displaying them but we'll talk about in

956
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,679
new york i think it's called

957
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,840
oh now i forgot it's um the excelsior

958
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,080
something else app uh the excelsior app

959
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,240
that that uh you know like i said a bar

960
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,600
or something that needs to demonstrate

961
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,200
proof of acts would use

962
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,279
um so these apps you want to be privacy

963
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,200
preserving which means that they're not

964
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,600
recording right and that's surprisingly

965
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,799
easy to

966
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,200
get the android store and google app

967
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,880
store to verify they actually look at

968
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
your code and if you say it doesn't

969
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,799
record anything they will know if it

970
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,559
does right so that's actually cool in

971
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,679
other words if it's in the official

972
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,799
store for android or apple then if you

973
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,519
say it can't record then it can't record

974
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,039
so you know

975
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,760
essentially no access to local storage

976
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,919
um only the access determined for the

977
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,159
camera and um

978
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,399
uh you know uh uh limited use of the

979
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,559
internet all these types of things um so

980
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
it's not recording um you also want it

981
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
to be policy import enforcing and this

982
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,640
is the trick and i'm not gonna dwell on

983
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,240
this a lot but it's really an important

984
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,559
concept and i'll describe it in the

985
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,399
canadian context i'll describe in the

986
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,440
u.s context so if you're a bar owner in

987
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,679
new york and you're required and we know

988
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,360
you're not anymore but when you are

989
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
required to get proof of vaccination for

990
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
people going into that bar or restaurant

991
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,519
or supermarket or something like that

992
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,760
um

993
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,480
there's not a uniform universal policy

994
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,120
on what a fully vaccinated person is

995
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,600
right so if you're and that's

996
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
not only just the case between countries

997
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,799
because they have some differences

998
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,120
between countries but even across uh

999
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,880
states they had different laws and we

1000
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,000
lived through this right they weren't

1001
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,679
that different but there were some

1002
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,399
differences uh and uh that also includes

1003
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,919
we're not gonna dwell a lot but it also

1004
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,639
includes various exemptions or deferrals

1005
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,560
so if someone got a note from their

1006
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,639
doctor that says they cannot be

1007
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,119
vaccinated then in some places you can

1008
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,119
get a pvc issued

1009
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,239
and it's uh and it's supposed to um

1010
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,800
flash green or you know uh come up as

1011
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,399
being affirmative as someone that meets

1012
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,879
the requirements of that jurisdiction

1013
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,918
but you bring that to another

1014
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,520
jurisdiction maybe they don't have

1015
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
exemptions or maybe your medical

1016
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,879
exemption is different from

1017
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,639
uh the list of medical exemptions

1018
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,119
permitted in uh in the jurisdiction we

1019
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,879
saw this all the time in canada quebec

1020
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,760
had

1021
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,719
i think 17 medical exemptions

1022
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,839
yukon had six for example right and so

1023
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,839
what that means is that exemptions were

1024
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,040
tricky i'm not going to dwell on that

1025
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,119
anymore though but the fact is that the

1026
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,800
policy would differ even for people that

1027
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,639
got the vaccination and also would

1028
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,399
evolve over time so you have the world

1029
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,839
health organization

1030
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,839
that would authorize vaccinations so for

1031
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,920
example the india or the cyanobacks of

1032
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,599
china one they would come up with a

1033
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,480
vaccine who would say yes this we've

1034
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,240
we've confirmed this is a good vaccine

1035
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,440
against

1036
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,400
covet 19 and therefore

1037
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,240
as long as you have two shots 28 days

1038
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,560
apart or you know some something similar

1039
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
then you should be considered vaccinated

1040
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,280
but the fda might take a little while to

1041
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
confirm that and so there would be a

1042
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,880
period where a valid vaccine from you

1043
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,720
know whatever china india

1044
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
europe or even canada is valid in that

1045
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,359
place but not valid someplace else and

1046
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,119
in the u.s of course

1047
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
um a lot of this was actually at the

1048
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,560
state level rather than being at the

1049
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,480
federal level

1050
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,640
so anyway policy enforcing is important

1051
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,920
and what that means because of the

1052
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,400
policy enforcement is that you have to

1053
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
um

1054
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,400
you'd have to

1055
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,280
have an app for every jurisdiction

1056
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,800
whether it's a state or even a

1057
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,040
municipality i suppose that has its uh

1058
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,400
its policy

1059
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,359
so um last thing to mention is

1060
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,359
independently operating i alluded this

1061
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,480
before you don't want to have an app

1062
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,680
that has to be on the internet you're

1063
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,640
not going to have a centralized database

1064
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,880
your app should be able to

1065
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,040
resist fraud even if it has no network

1066
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,200
connection and as i showed you before

1067
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,680
the hash does that right it's it's

1068
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,320
tamper evidence and then the public key

1069
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,040
you need to to demonstrate the validity

1070
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,400
and so you say okay what do you do about

1071
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,480
that newbie how do you um you know how

1072
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
do you do that if your app is offline

1073
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,640
and the answer is caching so

1074
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
periodically what will happen is your

1075
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,280
app from a given jurisdiction will have

1076
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
a list internally in another one of

1077
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,800
these json files and it'll go and

1078
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,880
refresh the list of what the um

1079
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,720
public keys are and that it'll cache

1080
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,280
them locally on the app so the app can

1081
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
actually uh verify a public key

1082
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,400
signature as long as the you know

1083
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
signature hasn't the public key hasn't

1084
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,520
been changed or revoked or something

1085
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,599
since then but they can do that offline

1086
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,359
so that was a requirement

1087
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,200
there's a reference app won't talk about

1088
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,079
that

1089
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,760
let me show you how it works

1090
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,320
as i said in canada each literally each

1091
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,079
of the 13 provinces and territories made

1092
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,480
their own in the u.s i don't know how

1093
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,160
many made their own app i'm not sure

1094
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,760
that all of them did even though they

1095
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,960
were using the same standard that

1096
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
doesn't mean they had to make an app but

1097
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,599
certainly there were a number of

1098
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,200
different apps going around including

1099
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
the um

1100
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
the one i mentioned in

1101
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,400
in new york the excelsior app

1102
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,160
so here

1103
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,640
i have the android version uh this is a

1104
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,520
yukon vaccination validator

1105
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,359
and um

1106
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,200
uh there's not much to see here but it's

1107
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,960
just an app that uses your camera i

1108
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,480
didn't initialize it just now i already

1109
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
had it running but when you first fire

1110
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,680
it up says a regular thing can use your

1111
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,160
camera it's canada so it lets you select

1112
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,839
english or french and then all you got

1113
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,000
to do is point out your your document

1114
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,079
your qr code and press the button so

1115
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,000
i'll do that now so what you see i don't

1116
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,119
know if you probably won't be able to

1117
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,119
see too well but uh the camera is just

1118
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,560
in the middle the camera is just showing

1119
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,960
whatever it's looking at so i'll have to

1120
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,200
i have to look at it so i can't do it

1121
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,480
quite

1122
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,960
facing you but uh

1123
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,079
nothing up my sleeves

1124
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,560
see there it goes

1125
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
meets requirements

1126
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,839
thank you very much

1127
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,520
so um

1128
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
uh that concludes the live demo portion

1129
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,599
of our of our day here so that flashed

1130
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,920
up green which meant that whatever is on

1131
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,359
my pvc

1132
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,520
meets the jurisdictional requirements of

1133
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,680
wherever the app came from and the app

1134
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,640
is periodically uh when it runs it's

1135
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,800
going to go and check and get the latest

1136
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,119
version of whatever that policy is so

1137
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,119
the policy is and there's no standard

1138
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,280
for this it's uh unique to the app but

1139
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
the policy is basically another json

1140
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,440
file that says here's a list of

1141
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,520
vaccinations here's a list of time

1142
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,000
between vaccinations in some provinces

1143
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
or territories it might say here are the

1144
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,960
types of codes for things like medical

1145
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
exemptions um

1146
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
and uh and then the app says okay

1147
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,599
whatever i read either meets that policy

1148
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,200
or does not meet that policy and it

1149
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,680
shows up green or red and when we first

1150
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,040
started doing this we also had i think

1151
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,720
an orange or something like that because

1152
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,480
there was a situation where you might

1153
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,200
have if you might recall there's a situ

1154
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,880
i'm sure you do recall

1155
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,800
there was a time when one vaccine was

1156
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,760
enough

1157
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,200
and then you know because you had to

1158
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
allow time between and then they wanted

1159
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,920
to have two

1160
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,440
right so that's a period where maybe

1161
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,520
you'd flash green because you had flash

1162
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
green if you had two but flash orange if

1163
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
you only had one right so partially

1164
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,760
vaccinated all right we're just about

1165
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,839
done here so there's a screenshot in

1166
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,839
case my demo didn't work

1167
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,400
and oh yukon because most of the

1168
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,079
provinces and territories have now shut

1169
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,440
off their

1170
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,640
validator because you know these aren't

1171
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,960
required anymore in most situations

1172
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,880
interestingly though they're preparing

1173
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,240
for a fall surge and saying oh maybe

1174
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,599
maybe we're going to be doing a booster

1175
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,800
campaign or maybe there'll be more

1176
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,680
requirements for this

1177
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,520
okay within the app and i have just a

1178
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,040
couple of little screenshots of this but

1179
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,240
there's a public key i've mentioned

1180
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
which is cache there's uh i didn't i'm

1181
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,599
not going to talk about revocation list

1182
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,440
but if you know about pki

1183
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,960
and other sorts of situations you know

1184
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,480
you have to have a revocation list so if

1185
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,880
the key becomes compromised or even say

1186
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,520
a batch of pvcs becomes compromised

1187
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,280
maybe an individual pvc becomes

1188
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,920
compromised or was false it was

1189
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,359
fraudulently issued you want to have a

1190
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,280
revocationalist who won't dwell on that

1191
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,920
the policy that i talked about just now

1192
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,520
and as i said we need to have these work

1193
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,640
online and maybe periodically go there

1194
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,119
and this is just a uh a little example

1195
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,480
of a

1196
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,520
of an issuer so who issued this thing

1197
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
and uh this normally would be a list but

1198
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,000
for uh like demo application purposes uh

1199
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,599
there might just be one so you can test

1200
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,960
it out uh this we saw uh momentarily

1201
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,680
before this is the um

1202
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,839
public key field which is i think it's

1203
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,560
truncated here but we saw that also in

1204
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,800
the uh verifier decoder

1205
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,480
and uh and that's what i wanted to talk

1206
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,960
about so what we've seen here is that we

1207
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,400
have a de facto standard we're

1208
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,200
leveraging a lot of free software

1209
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,520
and certainly a lot of open standards

1210
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,839
with uh with public key infrastructure

1211
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,520
and we had a lot of collaboration in

1212
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,920
canada u.s collaboration you know as you

1213
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,280
know not so good on um on a variety of

1214
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,760
things and so even though the states

1215
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,280
were individually choosing the same

1216
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,200
standard there wasn't a national level

1217
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,720
collaboration there was probably a lot

1218
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
of like state to state collaboration you

1219
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,280
have you know the organizations like cvs

1220
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,599
walmart making similar decisions but

1221
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,200
nothing that was

1222
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,960
federally orchestrated the u.s really

1223
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,119
opted out of that trump opted out really

1224
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,960
clearly and then biden continued to opt

1225
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,240
out of forcing a federal standard but

1226
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,599
the outcome though is because we're all

1227
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,480
using shc the smart health card standard

1228
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,359
is essentially interoperability and so

1229
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,720
in canada for example they have

1230
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,319
something called the arrivecan app you

1231
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,880
can show up with a pvc from anywhere you

1232
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,200
can show up with one from the u.s and

1233
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,560
they'll scan it and they'll be able to

1234
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,079
parse it and apply their policy and

1235
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,599
determine whether you're fully

1236
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,800
vaccinated

1237
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,560
in their case at a federal border

1238
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,040
protection level case they also can read

1239
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,480
standards that are different standards

1240
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,960
you know from europe and elsewhere

1241
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,119
so this worked pretty well the um the

1242
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,040
global pandemic made things happen a lot

1243
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,720
quicker than they probably would have

1244
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,880
and the privacy by design i think was

1245
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,480
really key and we've talked about that

1246
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,359
uh quite a lot and as i said uh uh the

1247
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,599
if you're in the room with uh uh you

1248
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,359
know government employees health

1249
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,440
professionals privacy is really top of

1250
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,079
mind and uh i realize that's not obvious

1251
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,480
uh you know uh without being part of it

1252
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,640
but i can report that's the uh that's

1253
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,400
the case so we do have a short-term

1254
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
solution but also we have sort of a

1255
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,599
longer-term prospect we didn't need uh

1256
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,800
blockchain

1257
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,880
it's uh interoperable

1258
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,359
works offline is privacy preserving it's

1259
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,880
self-sovereign so there's a lot of good

1260
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,000
things about this and that's part of

1261
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,920
what i wanted to talk about it so we're

1262
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,960
probably

1263
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,400
almost at the end of my time but i'd be

1264
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,839
happy to entertain a couple questions

1265
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,119
before we wrap up this is my email my

1266
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,480
name i'm gb newbie at petascale.org

1267
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,640
happy to correspond send out the slides

1268
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,279
anything like that

1269
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:07,839
[Applause]

1270
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,280
please feel free to walk up to the mic

1271
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,200
for questions i'd like to start with one

1272
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
from the matrix chat

1273
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,960
you did mention that there was a

1274
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,440
possibility for key revocation in this

1275
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,520
but do the public keys and certificates

1276
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
themselves expire and what happens to

1277
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,880
old credentials once that happens right

1278
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,720
so the the recommendation that

1279
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,560
accompanies this defacto standard is

1280
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,240
that you make a new signing key every

1281
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,839
year and that's just generally good

1282
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,280
practice because the signing key more or

1283
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,880
less is a password plus you know an

1284
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,119
algorithm that makes the uh the key pair

1285
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,960
the public and the private key so the

1286
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
recommendation is is make a new one

1287
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,240
every once in a while but the

1288
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,480
certificates themselves we decided in

1289
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,520
canada that they wouldn't expire because

1290
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,359
they're a point in time document in

1291
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,960
other words yeah you got these

1292
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,040
vaccinations and that's true

1293
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,800
always the only thing that might change

1294
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,480
as i mentioned relevant to replication

1295
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,000
list is if one of those vaccines turned

1296
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,839
out to be bad you know bad lot something

1297
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,440
like that

1298
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,319
or if and this happens a lot

1299
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,920
in canada it happened a lot in ontario

1300
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,480
in particular maybe um maybe the record

1301
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,640
maybe the source of truth was false so

1302
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,119
yes a revocation list is going to be for

1303
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:15,920
um

1304
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,800
either a a unique id associated with a

1305
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,599
pvc document itself or it's going to be

1306
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,920
for a a whole key and that hasn't

1307
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,200
happened in canada i don't know if it's

1308
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,280
happened in the us but if you're if your

1309
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,000
private key is compromised then your

1310
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
public key is suddenly no good anymore

1311
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,520
so you can actually revoke huge swaths

1312
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,119
of these things which would be a big

1313
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,640
inconvenience so that's kind of the

1314
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,319
story on revocation

1315
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,280
lists at the individual item level at

1316
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
the key item level

1317
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,400
and

1318
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,000
you can also have groups you can also

1319
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,480
have vaccine

1320
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,720
lots things like that and this actually

1321
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,200
this was a um extension to the shc

1322
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,000
standard that canada did i i i yeah it's

1323
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,119
in there it's in the dot i just saw it

1324
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,079
before it's in the technical

1325
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,720
documentation but the uh revocation list

1326
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,040
was not part of the shc like a year ago

1327
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,800
it got added recently

1328
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,160
there's a question there

1329
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,000
that mostly answers what i was thinking

1330
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,240
of like an example of of bad lots in

1331
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,760
this case you're saying the validator

1332
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,119
app would just flash red saying it's no

1333
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,440
longer a valid vaccination right yeah

1334
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,839
well i mean so the the uh the app is not

1335
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,240
telling you about a particular shot so

1336
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,920
you might have and it's interesting

1337
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,680
because there are corner cases let's say

1338
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,520
you got a shot and then the hospital

1339
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,119
called and says oh it's a bad batch you

1340
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,880
have to come get another shot your

1341
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,520
record might actually show the bad one

1342
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,280
and say two good ones and then you meet

1343
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,920
requirements but if it shows a bad one

1344
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,280
and nothing else then maybe you don't

1345
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,520
meet requirements so the uh the fact of

1346
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,200
it being invalid

1347
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,400
you know more or less means that the

1348
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,720
app's going to ignore it for your uh you

1349
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
know for your status being green or red

1350
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,359
or something else

1351
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,240
thanks for your talk uh thanks have you

1352
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,280
seen uh malicious keys out in the wild

1353
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
people trying to uh

1354
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,119
you know say oh yes i am a legitimate

1355
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,040
government and

1356
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,800
no these are these are really freaking

1357
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,640
locked down and maybe i should have made

1358
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,520
that made that clearer so the um

1359
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,599
and again i don't know about the u.s

1360
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,680
other than um

1361
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,040
uh i don't know about the the

1362
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,359
standardization centralization approach

1363
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,280
if it's outside of this context but

1364
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,359
there's really two things that happen

1365
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,319
one is the shc people themselves the the

1366
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,079
smart health card standards which is a

1367
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,280
basically a consortium based out of um

1368
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,119
boston um

1369
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,839
they retain the canonical list and to

1370
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,359
get on that list it's a little like

1371
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,040
getting in the app store with a health

1372
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,640
app you have to jump through a number of

1373
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,720
hoops so they have lists that includes

1374
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,000
all those people i scrolled through

1375
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,119
before all those places i scrolled

1376
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,640
through before

1377
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,839
and their their urls their issue or urls

1378
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,520
and when you go to that issue or url you

1379
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,440
get the list of keys so the issuer

1380
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,800
stores the keys

1381
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,520
but

1382
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,920
the list of valid issuers is stored in

1383
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,520
the smart health card

1384
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,280
official repository so yeah that could

1385
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,200
get hacked but but you know it's a it's

1386
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,280
centralized and it's highly protected so

1387
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
so you know some advantages there um

1388
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,640
in canada most of the provinces and

1389
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,640
territories opted to use a just a

1390
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,240
canadian list so it's sort of the same

1391
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,520
thing but rather than going to the whole

1392
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,920
smart health card list of hundreds they

1393
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,240
just had the canadian list of about

1394
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,200
fewer than 20 15 or so different

1395
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,880
different issuers so yeah that's the

1396
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,480
solution to that is

1397
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,160
that the list of those well-known

1398
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,760
locations where you're going to get the

1399
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,240
json is tightly controlled so this and

1400
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,440
that's sort of a typical thing when

1401
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,119
you're trying to come up with a solution

1402
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,960
like this is

1403
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,640
sooner or later you'll have a couple of

1404
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,079
single points of failure and then you

1405
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,400
just protect the heck out of those

1406
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,079
i do know someone who made a fraudulent

1407
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,760
one but he got stopped by what you just

1408
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,319
described that it won't scan correctly

1409
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,640
yeah yeah and there's a certain there's

1410
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,000
i guess you'd call it bureaucracy or

1411
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,680
trusts or validation or whatever it is i

1412
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,680
mean sooner or later you have to decide

1413
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,599
how you can determine whether

1414
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,839
you trust the issuer and you trust that

1415
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,680
you got a valid key from that issue or

1416
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,880
and by the way there's a little more to

1417
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,599
it which is the um the json that lists

1418
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,000
the issuer keys is also signed so you're

1419
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,599
trusting the source of that as well so

1420
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:06,640
there's a couple different layers in

1421
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,040
there it's reasonable i was going to ask

1422
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,079
uh

1423
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,839
what's the machinations i assume like

1424
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,599
this can support multiple

1425
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,760
uh other diseases like yellow fever and

1426
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,520
yeah the childhood stuff yeah like

1427
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,280
what's the progress on instrumenting

1428
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,280
those um

1429
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,880
uh i haven't seen it yeah and that's

1430
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,319
what i mentioned in my last point there

1431
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,960
that this seems like a sound basis for

1432
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,440
that type of thing um and uh the fact

1433
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,119
that we needed to come up with a

1434
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,640
standard for various you know basically

1435
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,760
because you're doing billions and

1436
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,040
millions and millions millions of these

1437
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,800
in all these different situations you

1438
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,160
say how can we do it efficiently you

1439
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,359
know anti-fraud and so forth um so the

1440
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,880
technology would certainly work for

1441
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,720
other types of vaccinations but i don't

1442
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,079
know if there's the same will or

1443
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,640
imperative to do that but it may be the

1444
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,119
case and the smart health card standard

1445
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,680
can can encode it's not it was it was

1446
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,599
invented it was around before covet came

1447
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,359
along so it can encode your whole

1448
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,960
vaccination record but sort of the rest

1449
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,319
of the stuff that i talked about just

1450
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,520
like just now the replication

1451
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,000
infrastructure lists of issuer ids stuff

1452
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,319
like that that's pretty unique to cobit

1453
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,599
and i know i'm out of time but thanks

1454
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,160
for your questions

1455
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,280
all right

1456
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,760
appreciate it

1457
